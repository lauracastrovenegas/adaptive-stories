(Wilfredo Lee/AP)SUNRISE, Fla. — As the Florida Panthers streamed onto the ice, Dylan Strome could barely lift his head. The Washington Capitals center was the last man back at the end of a long shift in overtime after winger Sonny Milano turned the puck over and the Panthers came flying down the ice. Strome dropped to a knee to try to block Sam Bennett’s pass to Gustav Forsling, but he couldn’t break up the play, and Forsling placed a shot between goaltender Charlie Lindgren and the post for the winner.Strome remained on the ice for several moments as Amerant Bank Arena erupted after Florida handed the Capitals a 3-2 loss that ended their three-game winning streak Saturday night.A month ago, when Washington (26-21-9) was scuffling through a dismal road trip and saw its playoff hopes slipping further and further away, picking up a point against the Eastern Conference’s second-place team would have felt like a win. But after the Capitals hung with the Panthers (38-16-4) in a tightly contested matchup — and gave themselves a chance to grab two points — coming away with one was tough to take.“We played fine. We played good. We competed,” winger Tom Wilson said. “Guys worked hard. It wasn’t lack of effort. It was just a couple things that they capitalize on. Bit of a sour feeling, for sure, just because they’re meaningful points and we’re right in the fight. It was a tough match. We left it all out there.”Nick Cousins put Florida ahead at 4:03 of the second period with a fluky deflection. Standing in the slot, he batted a point shot by Dmitry Kulikov out of the air; the puck bounced off the ice in front of the crease before sailing over Lindgren’s pad.Cousins, who earned the ignominious honor of being named the player whose face other NHL players most want to punch in the Athletic’s anonymous player poll last month, hit winger Max Pacioretty into Washington’s bench midway through the period, and that prompted a physical response from winger Anthony Mantha. Mantha was whistled for a hooking penalty on Cousins 14 seconds after the hit, and the two dropped the gloves. Mantha clearly got the better of the battle.The Capitals killed Mantha’s hooking penalty, and while he was serving his fighting major, they seemed to find a spark. It still took until the end of the period for Washington to find the net, but a series of strong shifts put more pressure on the Panthers and helped build momentum.“I thought we started off well. Sometimes you’ve got to wake up a little bit there in the second period,” Pacioretty said. “I thought we started to play physical. Both sides did — brought both teams into the fight. We found our game again, and we played some good hockey.”Wilson drew a hooking penalty with 3:09 remaining in the period, and after two unimpressive power plays in the first period, the Capitals cashed in on their third chance. From the right faceoff circle, Pacioretty slid a tape-to-tape pass across the zone to defenseman Rasmus Sandin, who seamlessly fired the puck back across the crease to Milano, who was waiting on the back post for a slam-dunk finish at 18:31.Washington hasn’t executed many tic-tac-toe passing plays, particularly on the power play, but this sequence was as crisp as the power play has looked all season.The Capitals were at risk of losing their momentum when defenseman John Carlson was boxed for slashing just 12 seconds into the third period, giving the NHL’s fourth-ranked power play a chance to grab the lead. But Washington killed the penalty with relative ease, allowing Florida just one shot on goal. And on the Capitals’ next power-play opportunity, Wilson ended a 14-game goalless drought with a power move to the net that beat Anthony Stolarz (22 saves) and gave Washington its first lead at 10:11.For much of the game, the Capitals avoided letting the Panthers get their forecheck going with a combination of puck control in the offensive zone and smart, efficient exits from the defensive end. But with under five minutes to play, Florida impressed during a lengthy shift that ended with two highlight-reel stops by Lindgren (26 saves) and a hooking penalty for defenseman Nick Jensen.Last time out: Capitals keep their composure, beat Lightning for third straight win“We did such a good job up to that point of exactly what we’d talked about — those pucks that go in the corner and you’re going to get pressure and you have to find an out,” Washington Coach Spencer Carbery said. “… We just mismanaged a couple of those, and then that’s what leads to sustained pressure.”Off the faceoff that began the power play, Bennett found space in the slot for an open look, but his wrister rang off the post — fooling large swaths of the crowd who celebrated as if he had tied the score. The Panthers’ fans didn’t have to wait long to celebrate for real: Carter Verhaeghe’s wrist shot from the top of the left circle was deflected by Aleksander Barkov past Lindgren just 43 seconds later. The Capitals hung on in the final minutes to force overtime, but the single point proved to be all they could muster.“I think since we came back from the [all-star] break, we’ve been playing good enough hockey to win,” Wilson said. “That being said, we’ve got to get results. Next game is the biggest game of the year, and the game after that is the biggest game of the year. Got to keep pushing this thing. Just banding together, grinding forward and see what we can do.”Note: Mantha didn’t play the last 5:45 of regulation or in overtime after leaving with an injury. No details on the nature of his issue were shared, but Carbery confirmed Mantha was hurt.Caps are left with a ‘sour feeling’ after OT loss ends winning streakCaps are left with a ‘sour feeling’ after OT loss ends winning streakCapitals keep their composure, beat Lightning for third straight winCapitals keep their composure, beat Lightning for third straight winCaps cruise behind two-goal nights by Connor McMichael and Alex OvechkinCaps cruise behind two-goal nights by Connor McMichael and Alex OvechkinThe Wizards keep experimenting, even as the losses pile upJosiah Gray tinkers with his game often.

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nWith his first spring training homer, James Wood made a young fan’s yearWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The teenager was sitting in the grass beyond the right field fence with his best friend when he heard the crack of the bat. Then he saw the ball in the air. Forget that piece of pretzel in his hand — he dropped it in the grass and made a beeline for the back of the lawn.“I was just like, ‘Oh, my God, no way,’ ” Michael Hecker said. There were others with the same goal, hoping the ball off the bat of Washington Nationals prospect James Wood would land at their feet. They would reach down and grab it. They would hold it up in jubilation. Maybe in the dream, they would hold the remains of their broken pretzel with the wrapper in the other hand — as Hecker did.“That home run just made my year — and it’s only February,” Hecker said.Hecker and his best friend, Jayden Vazquez, both 15, came to the ballpark Saturday to watch the Nationals and Houston Astros work out. Hecker is a Mets fan — he’s originally from New York — but his family moved to nearby Boynton Beach, Fla., a few years ago. He wore a Jose Altuve jersey Saturday strictly so he could get an autograph. They didn’t even know there was a game that night, but once they did, they paid $28 to sit on the lawn.Spring training gives fans a chance to get an up-close-and-personal look at players they admire. They stand along the fences with pens and baseballs, yelling players’ names as they walk from one field to another. Before games, they huddle down the foul line or by the dugout with baseball cards.But it wasn’t until Saturday that Hecker saw Wood and learned who he was.From last year: The outsize world of James WoodThat home run — seeing as it came in spring training — probably meant little to Wood. The 21-year-old has slugged 41 in his minor league career. He’s trying to make it to the majors, where he hopes there will be plenty more. After the game, Wood said he didn’t know where the ball landed. Asked what’s next, he replied: “Another game tomorrow.”For Hecker, that baseball was worth much more.“It means everything to me,” he said. “I mean, that’s awesome. I’ve never gotten a home run at a baseball game before. … That’s like an achievement for me.”Less than an hour after the game, Hecker and Vazquez sat on a curb in the parking lot. Every few seconds, they would peek into the Nationals’ facility to see whether Wood was coming their way.“Likely he’ll go out the other side, but you never know,” Vazquez said.“I got the ball in my pocket just in case he comes,” Hecker said.A few minutes later, Hecker and Vazquez would head home. Wood never did come out, but he already had made their night a few hours earlier.On Sunday, Wood picked up where he left off with a two-run blast in the fifth inning against the Miami Marlins. The homer came on a sweeper by lefty Devin Smeltzer and one-hopped off the batter’s eye in center field at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Fla.Lewin Díaz followed with a two-run homer in the sixth that propelled the Nationals to a 6-3 victory. Díaz, a first baseman on a minor league contract, is trying to make the roster after playing with Miami from 2020 to 2022.“It’s good to see the kid get off like that early in camp,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “He does everything really the right way, even when you watch him play defense. ... I love watching him play. He’s going to be special.”MacKenzie Gore started Sunday’s game; over two innings, he threw an efficient 26 pitches with 21 strikes. The left-hander, who turned 25 on Saturday, allowed one run while striking out four. His fastball was lively up in the strike zone, and he threw his curveball often — when he was ahead in the count and, perhaps more notably, when he was behind.“I thought it was good,” Gore said of his spring debut. “We continued to work on what we’ve been doing all season to the beginning of the spring. I liked how we stuck to the plan.”Right-hander Trevor Williams greeted his teammates and coaches with hugs after reporting to camp Sunday. He had an excused absence: the birth of his fifth child, a second daughter named Monica. Williams said he doesn’t feel as if he’s behind.He faced live hitters Friday in San Diego, even though they were high-schoolers. Martinez said Williams probably will throw a live bullpen session Tuesday, then throw a side session. After that, he should be ready to pitch in a game.“I feel like the only thing I was missing was the lights, the stadium,” Williams said. “I feel like my body is where it needs to be. My brain is catching up now that I’m here. My mind will be in season mode hopefully here soon.”Williams enters camp as the Nationals’ fifth starter, but nothing is guaranteed after his performance last season. He lost velocity and struggled with command during the second half, in part because of his workload. In all, the 31-year-old had a 5.55 ERA in 30 starts, but he will have every opportunity to earn the job again.It’s clear the young Nats are on the way. Less clear: Who will lead them.It’s clear the young Nats are on the way.

  "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — With a flick of the wrist in the fifth inning, James Wood sent the first pitch he saw Saturday night into orbit. It carried. It carried some more. It seemed the ball would never land, but it finally descended into the outfield grass beyond the right field fence. Fans converged, trying to grab the missile that landed at their feet.\n\nThe Nationals lost, 7-4, to the Houston Astros at Park of the Palm Beaches in their spring training opener, but the final score was far from the story. This game was all about prospects getting their first shot to show what they can do.\n\nAfter the 21-year-old slugger’s majestic home run, fellow outfielder Robert Hassell III, 22, followed with a line drive that turned into a triple; he scored in the ensuing at-bat. By the sixth inning, soon-to-be-22-year-old Dylan Crews replaced Victor Robles in center field. He made a sliding catch in the seventh to rob the Astros of a hit.\n\nBefore the top prospects entered, Patrick Corbin threw 50 pitches over 1⅔ innings and allowed two runs. He had four strikeouts, all of them with his new cutter. Then the youngsters got their chance. Jackson Rutledge, 24, tossed two scoreless innings on an efficient 31 pitches. Then came the three outfielders, who all provided a glimpse of what is hopefully to come.\n\n“This is going to be a fun spring training,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “One, we got to get our guys ready and, two, we’re going to see a lot of these young kids. ... It keeps me busy, but it’s a lot of fun. It’s a good busy.”\n\nReliever Dylan Floro is dealing with shoulder tightness but is still throwing every day. The 33-year old right-hander, who signed in December, didn’t recover well from his latest bullpen session. Floro said he has dealt with this feeling during past spring trainings, so he isn’t alarmed but wants to be cautious. He doesn’t believe he will need that many innings to get himself ready for Opening Day.\n\nGeneral Manager Mike Rizzo opened camp by saying it was unlikely the Nationals would pursue any more major league contracts. But he did leave the door open for minor league deals to give the team depth in case of injuries. Since camp opened, the Nationals agreed to deals with reliever Jacob Barnes, starter Zach Davies and, most recently, reliever Derek Law.\n\nBarnes, 33, is an eight-year veteran who has played for eight teams since 2019. Davies, 31, has made 200 career starts. Law, 33, had one of the best years of his career last season with Cincinnati, finishing with a 3.60 ERA in 55 innings before he was non-tendered in November. Law was holding out hope for a major league deal and was surprised he didn’t get one.\n\n“Yeah, a little bit,” he said. “But you could tell the way free agency was going at the beginning. I started getting nervous once it started and all these other big names weren’t going off the board too quick.”\n\nMacKenzie Gore will make his first start of spring training Sunday, and Jake Irvin will come next; each is slated to pitch two innings, to be followed by Kyle Finnegan, Hunter Harvey, Amos Willingham, Joe La Sorsa and Luis Perdomo. Josiah Gray is slated to start Monday, followed by Davies on Tuesday.\n\nSo far at camp, Zimmerman has been involved in morning workouts, and he has been getting to know the team’s young core better. But Zimmerman wants to grow in his understanding of the front-office side of the game as well. He has been sitting in on coaches’ meetings as well as gatherings with Rizzo.\n\n“That’s kind of my goal this year, to continue doing what I’m doing with the players and especially the young guys,” Zimmerman said Friday. “Also for myself, kind of learning the ins and outs of the other side and kind of become a little bit more knowledgeable so that I can better have suggestions.”\n\nFor the Nationals to build another championship team, Zimmerman said, it’s important to convince some of the squad’s young players to sign long-term contracts before they reach free agency. The Nationals signed catcher Keibert Ruiz to an eight-year, $50 million extension last spring. To do more deals such as that, Zimmerman believes the Nationals have to create an environment in which players want to stay.\n\nIt’s easier, of course, to make a commitment after Lerner announced his family’s intentions to hold on to the team. Zimmerman believes the Lerners’ past sets the precedent for what they could do in the future.\n\n“It’s not like they never spent,” he said. “... We had good payrolls for the better part of 10 years. … Now that he came out and said we’re not selling the team, let’s do it again — and let’s do it the right way.”",

  "text": "LAWRENCE, Kan. — Two juveniles held after gunfire exploded at the end of a crowded rally for the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory — killing one and injuring nearly two dozen others — have been criminally charged, authorities said Friday. They were charged Thursday with gun-related offenses and resisting arrest, Jackson County family court officials said in a statement. The two were being held in a juvenile detention facility.\n\nWhat police described as a dispute among several people outside the city’s Union Station on Wednesday sent fans scattering and fleeing over barricades as police and first responders — some 800 were on hand — descended upon the chaotic scene. Three people were taken into custody — including one who was tackled by Chiefs fans — a short time later. An adult detainee was later released.\n\nSgt. Jacob P. Becchina, a spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department, said in an email Friday that the teens had been held as authorities worked with juvenile prosecutors to determine the charges. The juvenile court system will determine their custody status, Becchina said.\n\nThe statement said that while the juveniles had been detained on “gun-related and resisting arrest” charges, “additional charges are expected in the future as the investigation by the Kansas City Police Department continues.”\n\nPolice have not revealed details about guns used in the shooting, besides saying several weapons were recovered. Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Washington Post in an interview Thursday that the “biggest challenge” for police in his Missouri city is the modification of firearms as well as “the ongoing presence of semiautomatic weapons.”\n\nOn Friday, musician Taylor Swift — who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — donated $100,000 to the family of Elizabeth “Lisa” Lopez-Galvan, the Johnson County woman who was killed Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two adult children, was a popular local DJ who hosted a program called “A Taste of Tejano” on the Kansas City radio station KKFI. The trade publication Variety first reported the donation, and the Associated Press verified the posts.\n\n“Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss. With love, Taylor Swift,” the singer wrote on the Lopez-Galvan’s memorial GoFundMe page.\n\nThe shooting devastated the Kansas City community, and came at the end of what was a storybook season for the Chiefs, after the team overcame initial struggles to take its second consecutive Super Bowl title in an overtime victory against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nOn Friday, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, visited some of the injured children at a hospital, according to photos posted on social media.\n\nMahomes announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the Chiefs had established an emergency response fund for “victims and their families, violence prevention and mental health services, and first responders.”",

  "text": "As Trey Filter’s family left the rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl win Wednesday, his son asked him if the loud bangs they were hearing were gunshots. Filter said no, figuring they were celebratory firecrackers. Moments later, Filter heard someone in the crowd yell, “Get him!” He saw a flash to his left, a man running by. Filter jumped on him, hoping it was the right person.\n\nHe and other bystanders tackled one of the three people detained by police for the shooting, and Filter’s wife, Casey, picked up a gun that landed near the suspect and moved it away, the couple recounted Thursday on “Good Morning America.” They, fellow fast-acting Chiefs fan Paul Contreras and other bystanders are being credited with springing into action as the celebration turned to chaos.\n\nThe gunfire broke out as the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory parade was wrapping up. One person, a radio DJ and mother of two, was killed and 22 were wounded by gunshots.\n\nThe shooting appeared to have resulted from a dispute among several people and was not an instance of terrorism or extremism, authorities said Thursday. Three people were detained by police, two of whom are minors, and are under investigation in the incident. No arrests have been made so far.\n\nWitness video verified by Storyful showed a small crowd fleeing as the suspected gunman ran down a grassy sideline area while bystanders pursued and then tackled him. The bystanders appeared to bring down one of the suspected gunmen, wrestling him to the ground and pinning him down until police arrived moments later.\n\n“They helped one another and even physically stopped a person who was believed to be involved in the incident,” Graves said. “I want to thank the people who acted bravely yesterday alongside law enforcement. … Your selfless act did not go unnoticed.”\n\nThe Filters, Contreras and Contreras’s daughter, Alyssa Marsh-Contreras, have given multiple interviews on local and national television recounting their stories since the incident Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment Thursday.\n\nContreras and his three daughters were walking back to their car when they heard the gunshots, which they also thought were fireworks until they heard shouts, he recounted. Contreras jumped on the man, like others nearby. It all happened in seconds.\n\nAs he tackled the man, Contreras told local television station KETV, “I see his weapon either fell out of his hand or his sleeve.”\n\nStanding next to them, Casey Filter saw the gun on the ground. At first, she thought it was a toy.\n\n“But then, once I picked it up, I realized it definitely was not,” she told GMA. She described it as “an AK” to Fox News.\n\nThose crowded around the man waited for police to arrive, still in shock. Marsh-Contreras said she thought the suspect was in his late teens.\n\n“They just kept him down” until the police came, she said, describing the situation as “very scary.”\n\n“You can’t be scared,” he said. “Not saying that you want it to happen, but there’s always that chance. It could happen at work, anywhere, the grocery store.”",

  "text": "One person was killed and at least 22 were injured at a rally after a parade Wednesday celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs’ win at the Super Bowl. Shots were fired near Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., where Chiefs players had addressed the fan rally. Video showed people running from the site and police entering the building.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among “several” people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLisa Lopez-Galvan, a radio DJ and host of “A Taste of Tejano” on Kansas City radio station KKFI, was killed in the shooting, Tommy Andrade, a family friend and co-host of the show, told The Washington Post. Andrade said Lopez-Galvan’s husband, Mike, informed him of her death. In a statement, the station called her death a “senseless act.”\n\nAndrade described Lopez-Galvan, a mother of two, as a kind person with an infectious smile. “She treated everyone she knew and loved as close family. She will be missed,” he said.\n\nEight of those injured had immediately life-threatening injuries, and seven others had life-threatening injuries, Kansas City interim fire chief Ross Grundyson told reporters. Six others were considered to have minor injuries, he said.\n\nPolice have taken three people into custody and recovered firearms but have not yet disclosed a motive. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said the shooting happened despite a heavy police presence because of “bad actors.” Hundreds of law enforcement officers were policing the parade, she said, which allowed for a quick response.\n\nLaw enforcement has asked anyone who might have video of the shooting or of alleged shooters fleeing the scene to submit it to an FBI portal as authorities work to investigate the motive.\n\nThe shooting is the latest high-profile example of the entrenched problem of gun violence in the United States. President Biden said Wednesday that the shooting in Kansas City should “shock us” into acting to limit gun violence.\n\n“This is difficult for our community,” Lucas said in a statement posted to social media. “We will continue to work hard to ensure assailants are brought to justice, our victims receive exceptional care, all families impacted receive our support and that we as a city and country do all we can to prevent tragedies like this from ever occurring again.”\n\nTravis Kelce, the celebrated Chiefs tight end, also said he was “heartbroken” over the parade shooting. “My heart is with all who came out to celebrate with us and have been affected. KC, you mean the world to me,” he said in a post on social media.",

  "text": "The deadly shooting that turned a celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs into a tragedy on Wednesday appeared to stem from a dispute among several people and had “no nexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism,” officials said Thursday morning. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a briefing that two of three people detained are juveniles. None has been charged yet, and additional detentions or arrests are possible, she said.\n\nThe shooting occurred about 2 p.m. amid a crowd of fans outside the city’s Union Station as the parade and rally for the Super Bowl champions drew to a close. At the sound of gunfire, people fled in every direction while police and first responders began swarming the scene. The three people were taken into custody a short time later.\n\nOne woman was killed and 22 people were injured in a matter of minutes. The victims’ ages range from 8 to 47, Graves said, and at least half are younger than 16.\n\n“This incident is still a very active investigation,” she noted. Authorities must charge the people in custody within 24 hours or release them, she said, adding that “we have all intentions of presenting charges.”\n\nA statement from the University Health hospital in Kansas City said three gunshot victims remained there Thursday, including two in critical condition. Saint Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City was continuing to treat one victim, who was still listed as in critical condition Thursday. Children’s Mercy had received a dozen victims, nine with gunshot wounds, in the aftermath of the rally. All are expected to recover, according to a hospital spokesperson.\n\nThe city continued to clean up the scene, which was still littered Thursday morning after with fans’ folding chairs, Chiefs regalia, and red and yellow confetti. The Jackson County prosecutor’s office was offering counseling services for members of the public feeling traumatized by what they had witnessed.\n\n“We are seeing more things with a lot of people getting hit, even unintentionally. I’m not going to get ahead of the facts here, but it is something that I think is a very real concern,” he said.\n\n“I’d be lying to you if I didn’t say that we’ll probably evaluate in the event that we’re blessed to have another Super Bowl championship,” Lucas said in an interview Thursday morning, wondering whether future gatherings would need to be held at a stadium or other location where attendees would be wanded at security checkpoints.\n\nThe shooting was the latest to upend a community’s celebration with deadly violence. And with parades coming up on St. Patrick’s Day next month, “my city and many American cities will be tested,” Lucas said. “Is this just something we live with in the same way that we’re living with school shootings and the threat to movie theaters and the threat to bowling alleys?”\n\nLucas said he had spoken Thursday morning with Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) about a 2022 shooting — allegedly by a 21-year-old man armed with an semiautomatic rifle — that left seven people dead and several dozen wounded at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill. Lucas said he told Pritzker that “I shouldn’t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.”\n\nOne security expert, Michael Chertoff, former secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security, also raised the issue of ensuring safety with such open events. In a stadium, he noted, “you can screen people for bringing in weapons or things that are dangerous, potential bombs. And you also can funnel them in through a portal that gives you control over everybody who comes in. Obviously, when you’re dealing with the street, you don’t have that capability.”\n\nOfficials declined Thursday to comment on the kinds of weapons used in the parade shooting. Missouri, which has some of the nation’s laxest gun laws, has no age minimum for possession of a firearm, though federal law prohibits minors from possessing handguns except in rare circumstances. A bill that Missouri legislators passed three years ago declared federal gun laws invalid and prohibited state and local authorities from enforcing them, but that law is tied up in court.\n\nThe Kansas City Council last August passed two ordinances to strengthen gun laws in the city. One measure banned specific weapons, including machine guns, firearm silencers and components, such as bump stocks, that turn semiautomatic guns into fully automatic weapons. The other prohibited the transfer of weapons, including ammunition, to minors. The mayor said at the time that he believed the ordinances complied with state law.",

  "text": "It was just like any other Tuesday night. Elizabeth “Lisa” Lopez-Galvan was on air for her weekly radio show, “A Taste of Tejano,” sharing her love of music. The program features Tejano music, a “Tex-Mex” fusion of Mexican and American musical influences.“Let us know if you have a birthday, anniversary or special announcement!” Lopez-Galvan wrote on Facebook before her show, as she often did.\n\nOnce the show was over, she and her co-host, Tommy Andrade, parted ways — not knowing that it would be their last time together.\n\nPolice said one person was killed and 22 were injured but have not named any of the victims. Their ages range from 8 to 47 years old.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among “several” people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two, volunteered on the show before joining as a full-time programmer and co-host about two years ago, said Andrade, her co-host and family friend, remembering her as a kind person with an infectious smile. “She treated everyone she knew and loved as close family,” he told The Washington Post. “She will be missed.”\n\nAccording to Lopez-Galvan’s radio station, her adult son was shot in the leg at the rally but had been released from the hospital.\n\nIn a statement, the Lopez-Galvan family said: “We thank the community for their prayers and support during this difficult time. We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one … who was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.”\n\n“We ask to please keep our family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of Lisa’s death while also supporting our other loved ones who were impacted in this senseless act,” the statement said.\n\nAbarca choked up as he recalled his conversation Wednesday with one of Lopez-Galvan’s cousins. Both broke down in tears. Then the cousin told him: “What you need to do is do your job and change this.”\n\nThroughout her life, serving others was a key part of Lopez-Galvan’s life — from assisting people who didn’t speak English as a court clerk, to helping people in her community find jobs, according to a 2021 profile in the local newspaper Dos Mundos. She was bilingual in English and Spanish, her profile on KKFI said.\n\nIn an interview with Kansas City Hispanic News late last year, Lopez-Galvan credited her father, who played in local Mexican bands after arriving in Kansas City in his youth, for her love of music.\n\n“I just want to thank him, because if it wasn’t for him and the music I listened to growing up, I wouldn’t have this passion for music,” she said.\n\nThe last Facebook post she wrote before her final show — where she asked for birthdays, anniversaries or other special occasions — has now become a place for people to mourn a woman they never knew.\n\nBut for those who listened or knew her, it’s also a place to remember a kind individual who “always wanted to help others,” as one person wrote.",

The program features Tejano music, a “Tex-Mex” fusion of Mexican and American musical influences.“Let us know if you have a birthday, anniversary or special announcement!” Lopez-Galvan wrote on Facebook before her show, as she often did.\n\nOnce the show was over, she and her co-host, Tommy Andrade, parted ways — not knowing that it would be their last time together.\n\nPolice said one person was killed and 22 were injured but have not named any of the victims. Their ages range from 8 to 47 years old.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among “several” people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two, volunteered on the show before joining as a full-time programmer and co-host about two years ago, said Andrade, her co-host and family friend, remembering her as a kind person with an infectious smile. “She treated everyone she knew and loved as close family,” he told The Washington Post. “She will be missed.”\n\nAccording to Lopez-Galvan’s radio station, her adult son was shot in the leg at the rally but had been released from the hospital.\n\nIn a statement, the Lopez-Galvan family said: “We thank the community for their prayers and support during this difficult time. We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one … who was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.”\n\n“We ask to please keep our family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of Lisa’s death while also supporting our other loved ones who were impacted in this senseless act,” the statement said.\n\nAbarca choked up as he recalled his conversation Wednesday with one of Lopez-Galvan’s cousins. Both broke down in tears. Then the cousin told him: “What you need to do is do your job and change this.”\n\nThroughout her life, serving others was a key part of Lopez-Galvan’s life — from assisting people who didn’t speak English as a court clerk, to helping people in her community find jobs, according to a 2021 profile in the local newspaper Dos Mundos. She was bilingual in English and Spanish, her profile on KKFI said.\n\nIn an interview with Kansas City Hispanic News late last year, Lopez-Galvan credited her father, who played in local Mexican bands after arriving in Kansas City in his youth, for her love of music.\n\n“I just want to thank him, because if it wasn’t for him and the music I listened to growing up, I wouldn’t have this passion for music,” she said.\n\nThe last Facebook post she wrote before her final show — where she asked for birthdays, anniversaries or other special occasions — has now become a place for people to mourn a woman they never knew.\n\nBut for those who listened or knew her, it’s also a place to remember a kind individual who “always wanted to help others,” as one person wrote.",

  "text": "Pevchikh claimed that Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who has played a role in previous exchanges involving Russian and Ukrainian prisoners of war, had conveyed to Russian President Vladimir Putin the proposal to swap Navalny for Vadim Krasikov, a convicted Russian assassin serving a life sentence in Germany. Abramovich did not respond to questions about the matter.\n\nShe said public signs of the secret negotiations first appeared in September when the Wall Street Journal reported that U. S. officials saw an exchange involving Krasikov as a means to secure the release of two Americans, Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, jailed in Russia for alleged espionage, after Moscow earlier brought up Krasikov’s name in prisoner swap negotiations.\n\nInitially, Germany had been reluctant to exchange Krasikov, who was convicted of carrying out an assassination on its territory on the orders of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. But Germany’s position changed once Navalny’s health deteriorated, the officials said.\n\nPevchikh did not identify which Americans would have been included in the exchange. But Putin, in a recent interview with former Fox News television host Tucker Carlson, hinted he would be willing to exchange Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich, who was arrested last March and accused of espionage, for Krasikov, whom he described as acting out of “patriotic” motives.\n\nGershkovich, his employer and the State Department have strongly denied the Russian charges against him. State Department officials have also sought the release of Whelan, an American former Marine who was convicted of spying in 2020 and is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Russia.\n\nPevchikh said that she and other members of Navalny’s team, based outside Russia, had been striving for at least two years to rescue the opposition leader via a prisoner exchange on humanitarian grounds. Western officials, she said, initially lacked the political will or desire to help.\n\n“It could and should have happened. Navalny in coming days was supposed to have been freed, because we had achieved a decision on his release,” she said. “I received confirmation that the negotiations were at the final stage on the evening of February 15. On February 16, Alexei was killed.”\n\n“A swap was one of the obvious ways to save him, but initially the task seemed impossible,” she said. His team made hundreds of phone calls and dozens of trips to try to make an exchange happen, but sometimes waited weeks for responses, Pevchikh said.\n\n“American and German officials nodded with understanding, said how important it was to help Navalny and political prisoners, shook hands, promised and did nothing.” She said Navalny’s team kept working on getting influential people to persuade Western politicians to take action.\n\nNavalnaya said last week that Investigative Committee officials had pressured her to agree to a private burial at an unannounced time or they would allow her son’s body to decompose. On Friday, officials gave her a three-hour ultimatum to agree, warning her that otherwise they would bury Navalny in the prison colony, according to Zhdanov.\n\n“The Kremlin has nothing to do with this. Naturally, there can be no pressure from the Kremlin. This is yet another absurd statement by [Navalny’s] followers,” he said. He added that “practically all of them” are on Russia’s list of wanted criminals.",

  "text": "As Trey Filter’s family left the rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl win Wednesday, his son asked him if the loud bangs they were hearing were gunshots. Filter said no, figuring they were celebratory firecrackers. Moments later, Filter heard someone in the crowd yell, “Get him!” He saw a flash to his left, a man running by. Filter jumped on him, hoping it was the right person.\n\nHe and other bystanders tackled one of the three people detained by police for the shooting, and Filter’s wife, Casey, picked up a gun that landed near the suspect and moved it away, the couple recounted Thursday on “Good Morning America.” They, fellow fast-acting Chiefs fan Paul Contreras and other bystanders are being credited with springing into action as the celebration turned to chaos.\n\nThe gunfire broke out as the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory parade was wrapping up. One person, a radio DJ and mother of two, was killed and 22 were wounded by gunshots.\n\nThe shooting appeared to have resulted from a dispute among several people and was not an instance of terrorism or extremism, authorities said Thursday. Three people were detained by police, two of whom are minors, and are under investigation in the incident. No arrests have been made so far.\n\nWitness video verified by Storyful showed a small crowd fleeing as the suspected gunman ran down a grassy sideline area while bystanders pursued and then tackled him. The bystanders appeared to bring down one of the suspected gunmen, wrestling him to the ground and pinning him down until police arrived moments later.\n\n“They helped one another and even physically stopped a person who was believed to be involved in the incident,” Graves said. “I want to thank the people who acted bravely yesterday alongside law enforcement. … Your selfless act did not go unnoticed.”\n\nThe Filters, Contreras and Contreras’s daughter, Alyssa Marsh-Contreras, have given multiple interviews on local and national television recounting their stories since the incident Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment Thursday.\n\nContreras and his three daughters were walking back to their car when they heard the gunshots, which they also thought were fireworks until they heard shouts, he recounted. Contreras jumped on the man, like others nearby. It all happened in seconds.\n\nAs he tackled the man, Contreras told local television station KETV, “I see his weapon either fell out of his hand or his sleeve.”\n\nStanding next to them, Casey Filter saw the gun on the ground. At first, she thought it was a toy.\n\n“But then, once I picked it up, I realized it definitely was not,” she told GMA. She described it as “an AK” to Fox News.\n\nThose crowded around the man waited for police to arrive, still in shock. Marsh-Contreras said she thought the suspect was in his late teens.\n\n“They just kept him down” until the police came, she said, describing the situation as “very scary.”\n\n“You can’t be scared,” he said. “Not saying that you want it to happen, but there’s always that chance. It could happen at work, anywhere, the grocery store.”",

  "text": "But major stumbling blocks remain: Israel has said it will not accept Palestinian Authority rule over Gaza in any postwar scenario and has vehemently opposed calls from the United States for a Palestinian state. And there is skepticism over Abbas’s willingness to relinquish power and to enact deep reforms that go beyond a change of faces.\n\n“Now here we are 21 years later and we see the same model,” Buttu said. “When people talk about a revitalized PA, what they are talking about is once again taking powers away from the president and giving them to the prime minister.”\n\nThe Palestinian political shake-up came as talks resumed in Doha, Qatar, to try to reach a deal on the release of more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for a cease-fire. An Israeli delegation arrived for the discussions, which are “lower-level technical talks,” according to one Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. There was “not much optimism” that they would bring progress, he said.\n\nWashington and other allies have urged Israel to hold off on a military assault until civilians can be safely relocated. Stein said the Israel Defense Forces has presented the war cabinet with a plan for evacuating Rafah, but refused to elaborate beyond saying that people would be allowed to move north.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who remain in the north of the Gaza Strip face a desperate struggle for survival. Aid deliveries to the north have all but ceased amid widespread chaos caused by acute shortages and the Israeli targeting of police forces that had guarded convoys. The United Nations is among those lobbying Israel to allow aid deliveries through a crossing in the north.\n\nDiplomats have also expressed concerns that the lack of a truce in Gaza could increase the risk of an expanded regional conflict, as Israel and Hezbollah enter a cycle of escalation. Hezbollah, the Iranian-aligned paramilitary that is also Lebanon’s most powerful political group, has tied its participation in any negotiations to temper border tensions to a cease-fire in Gaza.",

  "text": "This is not the old CJ Abrams — the shortstop who at times looked uncomfortable with the ball heading his way or overthrew his teammates because he rushed, the batter who kept swinging at pitches well outside of the strike zone.\n\nThis is the new CJ Abrams — the shortstop who attacks groundballs instead of letting them come to him, the batter who repeats his swing in slow motion around the team facility to make sure his form is correct, the player who this spring training has carried himself with more confidence built on his second-half success last year.\n\n“Seeing him coming in this year and watching him prepare, you don’t have to tell him nothing,” third base coach Ricky Gutierrez said. “He has his plan and what he wants to do and how he wants to catch groundballs. It just puts a smile on your face.”\n\nAbrams struggled early in 2023 but steadily improved once he moved to the leadoff spot just before the all-star break. He finished with a modest .258 batting average and a 95 OPS+, a league-adjusted stat where anything under 100 is below average. His chase rate of 35.1 percent was significantly worse than the league average (28.5). Still, there was good reason for his confidence boost. Eleven of his 18 home runs came after the all-star break. So did 33 of his 47 stolen bases. And he committed just eight of his 22 errors in the second portion of the season. He seemed to be putting it together.\n\nNow, he’s bringing energy to spring workouts — joking with teammates when the moment warrants it but also locking in when it’s time to work. Abrams entered camp stronger than he did a season ago. And though he’s still young, he is beginning to lead by example, particularly in the clubhouse.\n\nAbrams was among the handful of Nationals position players who reported early to spring training. As a whole, the team seems more cohesive than it did a year ago. Many of the younger players were in their first spring training with the Nationals in 2023. Now, there’s a lot more familiarity, among the major league players and the prospects alike.\n\nAbrams could be a bridge between two generations. He has been in the majors for much of the past two seasons, but he’s not much older than Robert Hassell III (22) and James Wood (21). He and Dylan Crews (22) even played on the same USA Baseball team in high school.\n\nAt one point during camp, Abrams sat at his locker in the back of the clubhouse, cracking jokes with Luis García Jr. and Ildemaro Vargas. A few moments later, Abrams moved toward the front, where the prospects’ lockers are. He swung one of Hassell’s bats. Earlier in the day, Abrams laughed with Wood on the way to the cafeteria.\n\n“It’s really important, you know — these are our brothers,” Abrams said. “You spend every day with them. So just having that bond, out there on the field we’ll play better as a team.”\n\nHassell’s introduction to Abrams came the year before at the Padres’ alternate site. Hassell, who had just been drafted, was in an unfamiliar environment full of new faces. But everyone knew who Abrams was. He was the draft’s sixth pick the year before, and he already had made a name for himself in the minors. Not long after, Abrams invited Hassell over to his place after one of their workouts. A friendship formed.\n\nAll three joined the Washington organization in the Juan Soto trade. When Hassell arrived at his first Nationals camp this spring, there was Abrams again — a familiar face that made him feel comfortable as soon as he walked in. Wood and Hassell both said they have gone to Abrams for advice, hoping to learn as much as they can at camp. They are just two examples: Manager Dave Martinez said the infielders are starting to rally behind Abrams as well.\n\nAbrams has a lot to prove as he strives to become the complete shortstop he wants to be and the Nationals hope he can be. At least for now, he’s exuding the confidence of one.\n\n“I think he’s starting to see that this is his team and, if he goes, the Nationals go,” Gutierrez said. “Last year in the second half, he noticed when he did well, we played well. I think he took notice of that, and this year he’s coming in with that in mind.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nWhat to expect from Kliff Kingsbury’s offense? Not the ‘Air Raid.’The Commanders' new offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, has roots in the Air Raid system. How will that shape his work in Washington? (Mnuel Balce Ceneta/AP)In their first days together, the Washington Commanders’ new coaches have stressed that no one — including them — knows what the team’s offense will look like next season. They say it’s too early, that they’re still figuring out what they want to build, that they will mold the scheme to their roster, which is going to change a lot over the next few months. One thing clear is what it’s not: the “Air Raid,” the pass-heavy, shotgun-based scheme offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury came up in.Kingsbury said he “wouldn’t categorize anything we do under that name.” Offensive line coach Bobby Johnson said some of the stuff Kingsbury ran as coach of the Arizona Cardinals “doesn’t look like Air Raid.” Quarterbacks coach Tavita Pritchard said it’s “super reductive if you say, ‘Kliff is Air Raid.’ ”“We want to be balanced,” Kingsbury said. “We want to be able to run the football and play-action pass and really do whatever it takes to win.”But whatever the label, it’s hard to imagine Kingsbury will radically depart from the foundations of his past successes. He will pass first (though probably not as much as Eric Bieniemy did last season), spread the field, take deep shots and use tempo. He’s likely to feature innovate passing concepts that create space and favorable matchups for playmakers. The question is how the staff will develop the running game and protection schemes and marry them to the passes.A lot will depend on the quarterback. Kingsbury said the traits most important to him are work ethic, leadership and mobility, and the top three prospects in the draft — Southern California’s Caleb Williams, North Carolina’s Drake Maye and LSU’s Jayden Daniels — seem to fit the criteria. Kingsbury will fit his ideas to his guy.“Everybody learns differently. Everybody processes differently, likes different plays, sees the game differently,” he said. “So I really try to get to the bottom of who they are as a person, who they are as a player and build it around them.”One facet of the offense that may seem niche but is actually important: how much the quarterback lines up under center or in the shotgun. Many offenses at lower levels nearly exclusively use shotgun, and Kingsbury, thanks in part to his Air Raid roots, did, too, with the Cardinals. But it’s harder to use shotgun at such a high rate in the NFL because it puts a lot on the quarterback’s shoulders.One way to see it is on play-action fakes. Fakes from under center, known as “hard” play-action, generally force linebackers to step up to stop the run more aggressively than “soft” fakes from shotgun, which allow linebackers a split second longer to read the play, letting them stay in passing lanes longer and making the quarterback’s margin for error smaller.In January, Fox NFL broadcaster Greg Olsen pointed out one common thread among C.J. Stroud, Jordan Love and Brock Purdy, three young quarterbacks who had success last season: Their offensive coordinators made things easier on them by putting them under center on early downs.“Shotgun is a critical element to modern offense,” Olsen wrote on X. “Has to be implemented, but the exclusivity of it is very dependent on having the perfect personnel to execute it.”If Washington drafts a quarterback, he will be comfortable in shotgun. Williams, Maye and Daniels all spent more than 90 percent of their college snaps in shotgun, according to the website TruMedia.But in the past decade, nearly all young quarterbacks have gone under center more in the NFL. Few coaches used shotgun as much as Kingsbury did in Arizona, with Kyler Murray at quarterback. The only other quarterbacks who played in the shotgun at such a high rate were Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts and Anthony Richardson. It’s unclear whether Kingsbury used shotgun at such a high rate because of Murray’s height (5-foot-10), his philosophy or both.So does Kingsbury, like Olsen, believe getting under center more would help develop a young quarterback, and if he does, how will he do it in the Commanders’ new system?Brian Johnson, Washington’s new assistant head coach and offensive passing game coordinator, was Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator last season and used shotgun for Hurts on 93 percent of his snaps. Johnson called shotgun vs. under center “a great philosophical question” that “boils down to intent.”“I do think, for young players, one of the things you’d like to do is make sure that you get them as comfortable as possible as quickly as possible, and there is a comfort level [in shotgun],” he said, adding: “There are very few teams that [are getting under center] now. I’m not saying there isn’t an advantage to doing that. But there’s definitely a learning curve for somebody that’s never done something to get them comfortable enough to go perform that on a Sunday in the NFL.”If Kingsbury gets a mobile quarterback and sticks with a shotgun-heavy approach, he could force defenses to respect the quarterback as a runner. Kingsbury could address the weakness of shotgun by using the pistol formation to create a hard play-action fake from shotgun; the approach worked well in Murray’s rookie season but became less consistent over time.Regardless, quarterback runs seem to be a priority for Kingsbury. When asked why he wanted to work with Bobby Johnson, the new offensive line coach, Kingsbury first pointed to Johnson’s creativity with tempo and the running game in offenses quarterbacked by running threats. Johnson spent time with the Buffalo Bills and New York Giants, coaching lines that blocked for Josh Allen and Daniel Jones.When free agency opens March 13, Washington will have to start defining its offense. If Kingsbury maintains the mix of personnel groupings he used in Arizona — sets with three wide receivers, four wide receivers and two tight ends — then the front office could prioritize a pass-catching tight end and another wideout (as well as offensive linemen, though the market isn’t as strong).But until then, the Commanders’ coaches will continue studying and shaping an offense they don’t have a label for yet. Less Air Raid, more … hybrid?“At the end of the day, offensive guys, we want to score points,” Pritchard said. “How do we do that? … We are in those stages [of figuring it out] right now, which is the really cool part. The exciting thing is we’re getting to forge our identity.”What to expect from Kliff Kingsbury’s offense? Not the ‘Air Raid.’What to expect from Kliff Kingsbury’s offense?

  "text": "One person was killed and at least 22 were injured at a rally after a parade Wednesday celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs’ win at the Super Bowl. Shots were fired near Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., where Chiefs players had addressed the fan rally. Video showed people running from the site and police entering the building.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among “several” people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLisa Lopez-Galvan, a radio DJ and host of “A Taste of Tejano” on Kansas City radio station KKFI, was killed in the shooting, Tommy Andrade, a family friend and co-host of the show, told The Washington Post. Andrade said Lopez-Galvan’s husband, Mike, informed him of her death. In a statement, the station called her death a “senseless act.”\n\nAndrade described Lopez-Galvan, a mother of two, as a kind person with an infectious smile. “She treated everyone she knew and loved as close family. She will be missed,” he said.\n\nEight of those injured had immediately life-threatening injuries, and seven others had life-threatening injuries, Kansas City interim fire chief Ross Grundyson told reporters. Six others were considered to have minor injuries, he said.\n\nPolice have taken three people into custody and recovered firearms but have not yet disclosed a motive. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said the shooting happened despite a heavy police presence because of “bad actors.” Hundreds of law enforcement officers were policing the parade, she said, which allowed for a quick response.\n\nLaw enforcement has asked anyone who might have video of the shooting or of alleged shooters fleeing the scene to submit it to an FBI portal as authorities work to investigate the motive.\n\nThe shooting is the latest high-profile example of the entrenched problem of gun violence in the United States. President Biden said Wednesday that the shooting in Kansas City should “shock us” into acting to limit gun violence.\n\n“This is difficult for our community,” Lucas said in a statement posted to social media. “We will continue to work hard to ensure assailants are brought to justice, our victims receive exceptional care, all families impacted receive our support and that we as a city and country do all we can to prevent tragedies like this from ever occurring again.”\n\nTravis Kelce, the celebrated Chiefs tight end, also said he was “heartbroken” over the parade shooting. “My heart is with all who came out to celebrate with us and have been affected. KC, you mean the world to me,” he said in a post on social media.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nGoalie Darcy Kuemper, left, shares an embrace with captain Alex Ovechkin after Monday's win left the Capitals in fourth place in the Metropolitan Division, just four points back of the Philadelphia Flyers with two games in hand. (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)The Washington Capitals were without winger T. J. Oshie, defenseman Martin Fehervary, center Nic Dowd, defenseman Nick Jensen and winger Sonny Milano, all of whom are written into the lineup in ink when healthy.Washington was hosting the resurgent Ottawa Senators, who entered Monday night’s game at Capital One Arena on a two-game winning streak after taking down Dallas and Vegas, two of the top teams in the Western Conference.None of that mattered to the Capitals, who matched their season high with six goals to beat the Senators, 6-3. They were led by a three-point game from forward Aliaksei Protas, the first multi-goal game of center Hendrix Lapierre’s career and a power-play tally by winger Max Pacioretty that ended a 17-game goal drought.After 1,400 games, Alex Ovechkin is the Russian machine that won't breakWith the win, its fourth in five games, Washington moved into fourth place in the Metropolitan Division, four points back of the third-place Philadelphia Flyers with two games in hand.“Through this stretch, I think you’re seeing a lot more goals because we’re playing a lot better,” defenseman John Carlson said. “We’re doing the right things and going to the right spots. You get rewarded for that. … If we want to get in this thing, like we do, there’s a lot of teams hunting that down. We don’t have time to think about it.”Defense and goaltending seemed to be optional Monday night. Washington netminder Darcy Kuemper made 18 saves on 21 shots; Anton Forsberg and Joonas Korpisalo combined to stop 14 of 20 shots for Ottawa.The Capitals jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first 8:30, getting goals from Protas, who completed a backhand finish on a two-on-one with winger Anthony Mantha, and Carlson, who scored on a quick-trigger wrist shot after center Dylan Strome won a faceoff on the power play.Carlson’s goal came seconds after he was honored for becoming Washington’s franchise leader in games played by a defenseman at 984, eclipsing Calle Johansson.“It was a cool little moment, especially after all that,” Carlson said. “It was just one of those things you can’t make up. Good things happen sometimes.”The most games played by a defenseman in franchise history and now the second-most goals scored by a defenseman in franchise history pic.twitter.com/8LWJzLWDBE— Washington Capitals (@Capitals) February 27, 2024\n\nBut the lead evaporated even quicker than it was built: Ottawa’s Drake Batherson and Shane Pinto scored less than three minutes apart to bring the score level with 12:41 left in the period.Pacioretty’s goal, his second of the season and first since Jan. 11, gave Washington the lead back with 1:27 left in the period. Winger Beck Malenstyn scored just 14 seconds later to double the lead heading into the first intermission.“I thought it was going to settle in from that point [at 2-2] because it gets sort of back to level, but we answered right there with those two late in the first period and took control of that game,” Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery said. “And still, there was a few instances where it almost went to 4-3 where it felt like we might be in something where it’s going to go back and forth, but our guys did a good job.”The two-goal cushion was needed after Ottawa’s Brady Tkachuk cut the Capitals’ lead in half 1:27 into the second period. That was as close as Ottawa came the rest of the way.Lapierre, whom the Capitals recalled from the American Hockey League’s Hershey Bears on Friday, scored the first of his two goals just 31 seconds after Tkachuk’s tally, capitalizing on a rebound at the far post. For his second goal, which stretched the Capitals’ lead to three, Lapierre finished a give-and-go with Mantha at 10:55 for a highlight-reel goal to pair with his workmanlike first tally.A touchdown has been scored and Hendrix Lapierre has recorded his first career multi-goal game pic.twitter.com/cA4W5TYxeN— Washington Capitals (@Capitals) February 27, 2024\n\nWith both teams on the front end of a back-to-back — the Capitals visit the Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday, while the Senators will play in Nashville — the third period was a grind, standing in stark contrast to the first 40 minutes. The teams combined for just 10 shots on goal as they glided toward the finish line.Lapierre, who was last with the Capitals when they were in the midst of an ugly road trip through the Central Division that began a six-game losing streak, feels the difference a month later.“We played a really mature and composed third period,” he said. “It’s not easy to be up by three and have to manage all that. But this group, they’ve been there, right? They know what it is, and they want to get there. You can definitely feel it in the air.”Here’s what else to know about the Capitals’ win:Oshie is considered “week-to-week” with an upper-body injury; he left Thursday’s win at Tampa Bay after going down without contact in the third period. Jensen was a game-time decision with a lower-body injury and did not play. Milano was a late scratch with an illness.Fehervary (lower body, week-to-week) and Dowd (upper body, day-to-day) skated Monday morning in noncontact jerseys. Carbery said he would “like to see them potentially, maybe” join the Capitals for practice Thursday, their next full skate following Tuesday’s game in Detroit and a day off Wednesday.Winger Ivan Miroshnichenko was recalled from Hershey to give the Capitals an extra forward for the back-to-back but was a healthy scratch against the Senators. To make room on the roster, Oshie was placed on injured reserve.After 1,400 games and counting, Alex Ovechkin still doesn’t breakAfter 1,400 games and counting, Alex Ovechkin still doesn’t breakCaps are left with a ‘sour feeling’ after OT loss ends winning streakCaps are left with a ‘sour feeling’ after OT loss ends winning streakWhat to expect from Kliff Kingsbury’s offense?

  "text": "The deadly shooting that turned a celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs into a tragedy on Wednesday appeared to stem from a dispute among several people and had “no nexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism,” officials said Thursday morning. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a briefing that two of three people detained are juveniles. None has been charged yet, and additional detentions or arrests are possible, she said.\n\nThe shooting occurred about 2 p.m. amid a crowd of fans outside the city’s Union Station as the parade and rally for the Super Bowl champions drew to a close. At the sound of gunfire, people fled in every direction while police and first responders began swarming the scene. The three people were taken into custody a short time later.\n\nOne woman was killed and 22 people were injured in a matter of minutes. The victims’ ages range from 8 to 47, Graves said, and at least half are younger than 16.\n\n“This incident is still a very active investigation,” she noted. Authorities must charge the people in custody within 24 hours or release them, she said, adding that “we have all intentions of presenting charges.”\n\nA statement from the University Health hospital in Kansas City said three gunshot victims remained there Thursday, including two in critical condition. Saint Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City was continuing to treat one victim, who was still listed as in critical condition Thursday. Children’s Mercy had received a dozen victims, nine with gunshot wounds, in the aftermath of the rally. All are expected to recover, according to a hospital spokesperson.\n\nThe city continued to clean up the scene, which was still littered Thursday morning after with fans’ folding chairs, Chiefs regalia, and red and yellow confetti. The Jackson County prosecutor’s office was offering counseling services for members of the public feeling traumatized by what they had witnessed.\n\n“We are seeing more things with a lot of people getting hit, even unintentionally. I’m not going to get ahead of the facts here, but it is something that I think is a very real concern,” he said.\n\n“I’d be lying to you if I didn’t say that we’ll probably evaluate in the event that we’re blessed to have another Super Bowl championship,” Lucas said in an interview Thursday morning, wondering whether future gatherings would need to be held at a stadium or other location where attendees would be wanded at security checkpoints.\n\nThe shooting was the latest to upend a community’s celebration with deadly violence. And with parades coming up on St. Patrick’s Day next month, “my city and many American cities will be tested,” Lucas said. “Is this just something we live with in the same way that we’re living with school shootings and the threat to movie theaters and the threat to bowling alleys?”\n\nLucas said he had spoken Thursday morning with Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) about a 2022 shooting — allegedly by a 21-year-old man armed with an semiautomatic rifle — that left seven people dead and several dozen wounded at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill. Lucas said he told Pritzker that “I shouldn’t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.”\n\nOne security expert, Michael Chertoff, former secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security, also raised the issue of ensuring safety with such open events. In a stadium, he noted, “you can screen people for bringing in weapons or things that are dangerous, potential bombs. And you also can funnel them in through a portal that gives you control over everybody who comes in. Obviously, when you’re dealing with the street, you don’t have that capability.”\n\nOfficials declined Thursday to comment on the kinds of weapons used in the parade shooting. Missouri, which has some of the nation’s laxest gun laws, has no age minimum for possession of a firearm, though federal law prohibits minors from possessing handguns except in rare circumstances. A bill that Missouri legislators passed three years ago declared federal gun laws invalid and prohibited state and local authorities from enforcing them, but that law is tied up in court.\n\nThe Kansas City Council last August passed two ordinances to strengthen gun laws in the city. One measure banned specific weapons, including machine guns, firearm silencers and components, such as bump stocks, that turn semiautomatic guns into fully automatic weapons. The other prohibited the transfer of weapons, including ammunition, to minors. The mayor said at the time that he believed the ordinances complied with state law.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nFrom jubilation to chaos, here’s how the Kansas City shooting unfoldedThe shooting broke out as thousands of fans gathered to celebrate Kansas City’s Super Bowl victory on Feb. 14. (Video: The Washington Post)Kansas City, Mo., had pulled off this celebration before. Thousands of people wearing Chiefs jerseys lined the streets and showered their hometown team with feverish fanfare in celebration of another Super Bowl win as red, white and yellow confetti fell around them. They’d jumped up and down, cheering loudly with their hands in the air to give the Kansas City Chiefs another memorable homecoming — the team’s third in the last five years.The “Chiefs Kingdom” watched excitedly as players made their way through the two-mile-long route in downtown, ending at Union Station, where they gave rousing speeches to a red-clad crowd. It was a day for Kansas City to celebrate back-to-back Super Bowl wins — a feat that hadn’t been achieved in nearly two decades.But at the rally’s end that afternoon, Kansas City fans heard the same sound that has transformed other American celebrations into nightmares: gunshots.After the Chiefs’ championship win, Kansas City officials knew fans would come out in droves to celebrate.Authorities posted information online about reunification sites ahead of the parade as they planned for the possibility of people losing track of each other in a crowd that they expected would be bigger than last year’s.Officials began closing down roads on Tuesday. By the next morning, hundreds of police officers were stationed along the route and around Union Station.Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce sang to the crowd at the team’s Super Bowl parade. (Video: AP)Around 11 a.m., Chiefs’ players started their journey toward Union Station, where they would address Kansas City faithfuls at a victory rally. The team rode atop red double-decker buses with “world champions” emblazoned in bold white font, driving slowly by hundreds of thousands of fans who had waited all morning to see them.It was “Party time again!” as the Kansas City Star had put it on that morning’s front page headline. That energy was palpable in every sign that was held, every flag that was waved, every cheer that was shouted. All morning, the city sang, danced and welcomed back its team.Near the end of the parade, fans crowded around Union Station to hear from the victors in the parade’s finale.“Chiefs Kingdom, y’all are the reason that we do what we do,” quarterback Patrick Mahomes told the crowd.Kansas City fans had gathered close together, forming a sea of red as they listened to the speeches.But, soon, they would splinter in every direction.‘It seems like almost nothing is safe.’At first, some thought the noise that erupted around 2 p.m. was fireworks.But the volley of gunfire continued, sending paradegoers sprinting away from the sound of gunfire. Some dropped to the ground, trying to take cover behind railings or cardboard boxes. Within moments, a day that had started with sheer joy spiraled into a shocking tragedy.“It seems like almost nothing is safe,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas (D) said.Around 2 p.m. Central time on Feb. 14, shots rang out while terrified fans fled the area. (Video: Anonymous via Storyful)Police who were already staged around the parade rushed to the scene. Fans continued to flee, crushing regalia and confetti strewn on the concrete in their wake.Police officers are seen running toward the scene of the shooting at Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., on Feb. 14. (Video: AP)During the chaos, someone in the crowd yelled “Get him!”A group of fans nearby ran and tackled one of the three people who was later detained by police, Trey Filter, one of the bystanders, recalled.Fans tackled an alleged shooter as he was running through the crowd on Feb. 14. (Video: Christopher A & Alyssa Marsh-Contreras via Storyful)Police on Thursday said the shooting stemmed from a personal dispute among several people. One person was killed and at least 22 others were injured in the incident, officials said. Of those injured, half were under 16 years old.Lucas, the Kansas City mayor, was one of several politicians in attendance. He later described how he, along with his wife and mother, had to run for safety as they heard the gunshots erupt.“This is a day that a lot of people look forward to, something they remember for a lifetime,” Lucas said. “And what they shouldn’t have to remember is the threat of gun violence marring a day like this.”Police reported shots fired, saying “multiple people were struck” at Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., following speeches by the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 14. (Video: AP)‘She was so full of life’On Wednesday, local radio station KKFI 90.1 FM confirmed that Elizabeth “Lisa” Lopez-Galvan, one of its hosts, died in the shooting. Lopez-Galvan, who was also a DJ for special occasions in the community and “did everybody’s wedding,” had been known for her contagious smile and laugh.“She was so full of life,” Lisa Lopez, a longtime friend of Lopez-Galvan, told the Kansas City Star.Tommy Andrade said Lopez-Galvan, his friend and co-host, “treated everyone she knew and loved as close family.”Lopez-Galvan had gone to the parade with her adult son, who was shot in the leg, according to KKFI. Her family has been heartbroken, they said in a statement, calling her an “amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.”As of Thursday evening, authorities had yet to file any charges or identify what firearms they had recovered from the scene.As they continue to investigate, questions surrounding the incident have left Kansas City residents wondering how their home became the latest in a long list of places turned upside down by gun violence.First responders arrive after a shooting in Kansas City, Mo., on Feb. 14. (Video: The Washington Post)Chiefs fans and players asked those same questions as they took to social media after the parade.“When are we going to fix these gun laws?” Chiefs defensive end Charles Omenihu wrote in one post.Wednesday’s shooting marked the most recent example of gun violence in the United States, which many regard as an aspect that has become an all-too-common part of living in America. It had scarred what was supposed to be a day of celebration in Kansas City, the way it had at schools, rallies and movie theaters across the country, Lucas said.“I wish we lived in a world where we wouldn’t have to see incidents like that,” he said.But by day’s end, it was much quieter, with crinkled confetti and crushed cans on the ground, surrounded by yellow police tape.",

  "text": "That didn’t take long. On Feb. 16, Alabama’s state Supreme Court ruled, 8-1, that frozen embryos are children, entitled to protection under an 1872 state law that allows parents to sue over the wrongful death of a minor child. Within a week, members of the state’s Republican-majority legislature and the GOP governor were promising to enact laws protecting in vitro fertilization, a fertility procedure that involves creating and freezing embryos in a lab. The backlash against the court’s ruling, both in Alabama and around the country, was that intense — as it should have been.\n\nRooted in the 1872 law and a state constitutional provision making it Alabama’s public policy to recognize and support “the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life,” the ruling allowed three couples to sue a fertility center over the accidental destruction of embryos they had stored there. While those couples deserve some recompense, the court proceeded with what can only be called callous obliviousness to the wider implications of its decision.\n\nWhether created naturally or through IVF, many embryos do not result in a successful pregnancy due to chromosomal or other abnormalities. So IVF doctors recommend creating multiple embryos in the lab, which inevitably means that, whatever the outcome of any given attempt to have a child, one or more embryos could be left. Some are used to try for another child, some are donated to medical research, some are saved indefinitely, and some are discarded.\n\nThe Alabama ruling has made IVF practitioners fear that any mistake handling, implanting or storing embryos could make them, in the eyes of the law, as legally exposed as a reckless driver who hits a child. At least three Alabama clinics paused operations after the state Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThose clinics remain on pause, even as Alabama’s GOP politicians backpedal. Also in damage control mode are national Republicans. A newly released memo from their Senate campaign committee advised candidates to “state your support for IVF and fertility-related services as blessings for those seeking to have children” and to “publicly oppose any efforts to restrict access to IVF and other fertility treatments, framing such opposition as a defense of family values and individual freedom.” That is: adopt the rational, humane approach 85 percent of Americans favor — and that personally benefited former GOP vice president Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, among other Republican luminaries. Alas for former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, she did not get the memo in time. Having initially voiced some sympathy for the notion that an embryo is a baby, she quickly pivoted to supporting IVF.\n\nAn overwhelming national consensus is rapidly making an impact. The episode is much less positive, however, in what it demonstrates about the insistence of some on the religious right to roll back progress — technological, social and legal — on matters related to reproduction and reproductive freedom. You would have thought they had learned from the disastrous election results for Republicans that followed the U. S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, as women — and men — across the country voted to keep abortion legal in their states.\n\nTo be sure, the interaction of its constitution and the 1872 law, plus the freak accident that resulted in destruction of a particular lab’s embryos, could make Alabama’s case unique. The mind-set behind the court’s ruling, however, is still widely held.\n\nState lawmakers in Louisiana, Missouri and Texas have — unsuccessfully so far — tried to curb birth control methods such as the “Plan B” emergency pill taken after sex and intrauterine devices (IUDs).  These methods may prevent the implantation of an embryo into the uterine wall — unacceptable to some of those who consider embryos to be people. Aside from Alabama, at least 10 other states already have laws or policies that broadly define personhood as beginning at fertilization, according to advocacy group Pregnancy Justice. Antiabortion activists are already touting the Alabama ruling as “precedent” to argue in other states that “unborn life must be protected at every stage.”\n\nEven if Alabama corrects its Supreme Court’s error, the fact that it happened at all is a sobering moment for anyone who thought the post-Roe push to roll back reproductive freedom had ended, or would be narrowly focused. A stubborn minority is intent on curbing  rights and freedoms that a majority of Americans, across the ideological spectrum, have come to rely on. And in some places, this minority has power.",

  "text": "If you want a window into what’s on the country’s mind, pay attention to what governors say during their annual state of the state speeches. Last year, the teen mental health crisis was a common theme. This year, more than 20 governors talked to their state legislatures about housing affordability and accessibility. Rent or mortgage payments are the biggest expense in many family budgets. And yet higher interest rates, engineered by the Federal Reserve for the urgent purpose of cooling inflation, have had the negative side effect of making it harder for young people to afford a home.\n\nThe conventional policy kit focuses on the demand side of the problem: rent controls, eviction moratoriums, direct payments, subsidies for home improvements and mortgage assistance. There can be a limited role for such policies. But as governor after governor acknowledged, there’s a growing recognition that solutions lie primarily on the supply side. Whether there’s an actual shortage of housing in the United States is a matter of debate and definition, but expert estimates suggest improving overall affordability would require increasing the existing stock of about 142 million homes by between 1.7 million to 7.3 million.\n\nThe result is a pendulum swing in favor of growth and development. “The rent is too damn high, and we don’t have enough damn housing,” said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). “Our response will be simple: Build, baby, build!” She set a goal of 75,000 new or refurbished units in five years. She touted a new $1.4 billion state investment in construction. “The single largest threat to our future prosperity is the price of housing,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), who called for $150 million worth of infrastructure and other spending to support construction of 35,000 starter homes by 2028.\n\nWhat’s especially interesting about this year’s state of the state speeches, though, is how often governors called not only for more spending but also for fewer regulatory barriers to new private-sector construction: Nine of them did so in one form or another. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) proposed allowing homeowners to rent out accessory dwelling units, better known as granny flats or casitas. He’s also pressing to ease occupancy limits and parking requirements for new construction. “Housing policy that creates more affordable choices for Coloradans is my Roman Empire,” he said. “If you don’t get that joke, feel free to ask someone from Gen Z.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) wants to lift limits on residential density in New York City, specifically what’s called the floor area ratio. Like Mr. Polis, she also wants to let people turn existing basement and cellar apartments into units they can legally rent out. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) advocated making it easier for developers to convert empty parking lots, half-empty office buildings and abandoned industrial sites into housing. He highlighted 250 new units in Meriden, Conn., that replaced a bankrupt shopping center. “We will cut government red tape that makes it harder to build quality housing,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) promised. “We must protect our farmland and wild habitats, but we need to make sure we are also incentivizing housing in places where we should build.”\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey (D) calls housing “the biggest challenge we face” and says the shortage has been “decades in the making.” She proposes an Affordable Homes Act to “reduce barriers to housing production and give communities the tools to develop more housing where they need it.” Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) asked his Democratic-supermajority legislature to revisit a 1970 law that makes construction expensive and slow by requiring a public, quasi-judicial process for reviewing and managing the environmental, social and fiscal consequences of development. “It was enacted at a time when we were growing way too fast,” he said. “Today we face a different reality — one where families desperately need homes.”\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) announced a new Office of Housing as a one-stop shop for contractors seeking permits and asked the legislature to condition state aid to local governments on their adoption of development-friendly zoning and permitting requirements. For their part, red states also continue trying to speed up reviews, inspections and permits. “Legislation about permitting may not sound like front-page news,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R). “But just take it from someone who spent 35 years in the construction industry: A bureaucratic permitting process is bad for everybody but the government.”\n\nThe country’s pressing housing needs cannot wait for a deadlocked Washington to act. Fortunately, the states — the proverbial laboratories of our democracy — are launching their own experiments.",

  "text": "Two days before the Washington Senators opened the 1924 season, a local sportswriter asked Bucky Harris, the team’s player-manager, for his forecast of the year ahead.“I believe that I have a club that will bear watching in the pennant race,” Harris said, declining to offer a more specific prediction. The Senators were synonymous with losing — “Washington: First in war, first in peace, last in the American League,” went the classic vaudeville line — and had finished no better than fourth in the previous five seasons, so it was easy to dismiss Harris’s outlook as overly optimistic. But over the next seven months, the second baseman was proved right as Washington, led by ace Walter Johnson and outfielder Goose Goslin, overcame a slow start to win 92 games en route to the franchise’s first World Series title.\n\nWashington’s improbable season is chronicled in Gary Sarnoff’s new book, “Team of Destiny: Walter Johnson, Clark Griffith, Bucky Harris and the 1924 Washington Senators,” which could offer the tiniest sliver of hope for Nationals fans as Manager Dave Martinez’s team prepares for what figures to be another losing campaign. (The Nationals will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Senators’ 1924 title in September.)\n\n“It’s just such a wonderful story about an underdog, a team that surpassed all expectations, a team that had a losing tradition before 1924 and wasn’t expected to do well that season,” Sarnoff said in a phone interview. “And it’s a story, of course, about Walter Johnson finally getting to pitch for a winning team.”\n\nSarnoff weaves firsthand reports from various newspapers and several books to provide a detailed account of the Senators’ season, mixing information from game recaps with off-the-field happenings to put readers in the middle of the pennant race. One of the first stories the Alexandria resident and Nationals season ticket holder recounts is how Harris, then 27, learned he had become MLB’s youngest manager.\n\nTwo weeks before the Senators reported to spring training, Washington Herald sportswriter John Dugan polled D. C. baseball fans and reported enthusiasm for the club was at a “low ebb.” It was hardly surprising given that the team hadn’t made any significant changes to a roster that finished three games under .500 the previous year and had been without a manager since owner Clark Griffith fired Donie Bush after the 1923 season.\n\nOn Feb. 9, Harris, who had reported early to Washington’s spring training facility in Tampa, received a telegram from D. C. businessman and baseball fan George Preston Marshall. The message from the future founder of Washington’s NFL franchise contained only one word: “Congratulations.” Harris, who had been the subject of trade rumors that offseason, assumed he had been dealt, potentially to the defending World Series champion New York Yankees. Then he received a second telegram from Griffith offering him the Senators’ managerial job. “I’ll take that job and win Washington’s first American League pennant,” Harris responded.\n\nSportswriters dubbed the choice “Griffith’s folly,” and their skepticism seemed justified when Washington dropped to 24-26 and sixth place in the AL in mid-June. The Senators rattled off nine straight wins, including a three-game sweep of the Yankees at Yankee Stadium that vaulted them to the top of the standings. President Calvin Coolidge reserved the box at Griffith Stadium for the doubleheader the next day, and fans greeted the team upon its return from New York at Union Station.\n\nEnthusiasm for the Senators in D. C. was soaring. As Sarnoff details, a motorist stopped at a gas station in the District just before 11 p.m. Aug. 1 and saw a mob of people rushing a deliveryman carrying a stack of newspapers. “What are they fighting for?” he asked. “It is the early edition of The Washington Post,” the station attendant explained. “From what I understand, it is all on account of the Griffs.” During the pennant race and the Senators’ World Series run, thousands of fans gathered outside newspaper buildings in the city to follow the action on electronic scoreboards.\n\nOne of the most surprising things Sarnoff learned in researching the book was that Johnson planned to make the 1924 season his last. The eventual Hall of Famer, who had turned 36 in November, wrote a letter to Griffith in January informing him of his plans to retire.\n\n“He wanted to settle down in one location with his family,” said Sarnoff, whose first book, “The Wrecking Crew of ’33,” is about the Senators’ last AL pennant. “His plan was to go to California and buy a Pacific Coast League team and run the team and manage the team. It didn’t work out that way, of course.”\n\nJohnson went 23-7 with a 2.72 ERA in 1924, and he led the AL in strikeouts for the 12th and final time. His presence on the roster — and the fact that he had never gotten the chance to pitch in the postseason during his illustrious career — was one of the primary reasons fans and even players in other cities were rooting for Washington to win it all.\n\n“I’m pulling for the Yankees to win the pennant, and I think they will, but if they don’t, there’s no club in the league I’d rather see than Washington,” Yankees slugger Babe Ruth said in July.\n\nThe Senators clinched the pennant at Boston in late September. Sarnoff describes Johnson walking slowly from the bullpen to the clubhouse after that game, with tears in his eyes, as 15,000 fans at Fenway Park gave him a standing ovation. Johnson appeared in three games in the 1924 World Series and pitched four innings of scoreless relief in Game 7 to earn the win in the Senators’ 12-inning, 4-3 triumph over the heavily favored New York Giants.\n\n“Tell everyone I’m tickled to death and everything along those lines you can think of,” Johnson, who led Washington to a second AL pennant in 1925 and pitched two more years before retiring in 1927, told reporters after winning his only title. “I’ll stand behind everything you say as I can’t express my feelings in words right now.”",

  "text": "In recent weeks, the Washington Capitals have started to alter their offensive philosophy. It has taken time for the changes to take root, but their new mentality was on full display during a 6-2 win over the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night at Capital One Arena. The Capitals have scored six goals just twice this year — both times against the Devils. This time, center Connor McMichael scored two times for the first multigoal game of his career, captain Alex Ovechkin added two more and Charlie Lindgren stopped 37 shots as Washington cruised to a victory.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery declined to go into detail on what the Capitals have tweaked, but what he was willing to say is that they are placing a higher emphasis on shot volume — not at the expense of shot quality but with the goal of finding a better balance between the two. Not surprisingly, that has led to more players going to the net. When they know the puck will get there, the theory is, they are more willing to get to the areas of the ice where the majority of the goals are scored.\n\nAmong Washington’s 10 goals in its past two games — including Saturday night’s 4-3 win at Montreal — seven have come from players who were in position to take advantage of an opportunity around the net. Those 10 goals represent a relative bonanza for a team that ranks 30th in the 32-team NHL in goals per game.\n\n“It’s helping that we’re getting some results, so now it’s becoming a lot more consistent,” Carbery said. “They’re seeing, ‘I want to get rewarded, too, so I know where I need to go and I know what’s going to take place before I go there to have a lot of confidence that pucks are going to end up there.’ ”\n\nMcMichael provided proof of concept with his opening tally just 39 seconds into Tuesday’s game. As defenseman Rasmus Sandin carried the puck up the ice, he was followed closely by McMichael and Aliaksei Protas. Devils goalie Nico Daws (20 saves) made the initial stop on Protas, but McMichael — who was crashing the net in search of a rebound — pounced on the loose puck to put Washington (25-21-8) ahead.\n\nNemec, a rookie defenseman whom the Devils drafted with the No. 2 pick in 2022, found himself on the wrong side of the highlight reel on McMichael’s second goal. In the second period, McMichael took the puck from the Devils’ Tomas Nosek at the blue line, deked past Nosek, deked past Nemec, faked a shot and then tucked the puck past a sprawling Daws for his 10th of the season.\n\nThough the Devils outshot the Capitals 17-7 in the second, Lindgren’s performance kept Washington ahead. On a penalty kill midway through the period, the Capitals were stuck in their defensive zone for nearly the full two minutes, and Lindgren made four saves in quick succession — to go with key blocks from Protas, winger Tom Wilson and defenseman John Carlson — to prevent New Jersey from tying the score.\n\n“We were able to sort of hang on,” Carbery said. “But you could feel that if there was another 20 minutes that looked like that second period, that it was going to probably not end favorably.”\n\n“When you’re sitting back and trying to protect a lead, I think it can get a little bit dangerous,” Lindgren said. “It’s nice to see our group not do that and actually just attack.”\n\nProof of the value of getting to the net arrived again early in the period, when center Dylan Strome scored his team-leading 21st goal. From the right faceoff circle, Ovechkin fed Strome as he skated toward Daws, and though Daws stopped his first shot, Strome sent the rebound past him as the netminder tried in vain to get back across the crease.\n\nOvechkin extended his point streak to nine games with the primary assist on Strome’s tally. He notched his first goal of the night at 8:44 to pad Washington’s lead, then added another with a back-post tap-in on the power play with just 33 seconds left. He has eight goals in his past eight games, 16 on the season and 838 in his career.\n\nAs if the Capitals needed any more proof that their new offensive mentality was paying dividends, Mike Sgarbossa scored Washington’s third goal from just outside the crease at 12:27. Sgarbossa wheeled around behind Daws and popped out to the front of the net unmarked, just in time to jam home a pass from Max Pacioretty and notch his first goal since Dec. 17, 2021.\n\nWashington entered Tuesday’s game four points behind the Devils in the Metropolitan Division, albeit with a game in hand. The Capitals’ odds of making the playoffs remain long, but wins such as Tuesday’s are what will be required if they’re going to have a chance.",

  "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Midway through the Washington Nationals’ first day of full-squad workouts Tuesday, Dylan Crews walked past a few dozen autograph-seeking fans, kept his vision straight ahead and politely promised them he would sign after practice. About 20 paces later, he angled around a fence to field flyballs and take his first on-field reps of live batting practice. It took just one swing for Crews, the top prospect in the Nationals’ farm system, to send a pitch from Cole Henry over the right field wall for an opposite-field home run. Before he even stepped to the plate, though, Crews fielded the same query, this time from a dad and his two young daughters. In a quieter moment, he signed their ball.\n\n“That’s the best player we’ve got. That’s the best prospect in baseball,” he said before pointing at the signature. “And we got him right here on this baseball.”\n\nThe real Dylan Crews — the living, breathing outfielder who turns 22 next Monday and introduced himself to his first major league camp with a hushed smile — arrived at the Nationals’ spring training facility in silence Sunday morning, unloaded four bats into the top shelf of his locker and appeared to do everything he could to hush the neon-colored, headbanging, dream-inducing frenzy that the idea of Dylan Crews had manifested.\n\nIn his first three days at camp, it has been clear that the idea of Crews is, well, much louder than the real thing. The idea was plucked from LSU with the No. 2 pick in last year’s draft and given the second-largest signing bonus in MLB draft history. The idea, Baseball America’s No. 6 overall prospect, had a locker at the front entryway of the clubhouse. Next in line? A handful of the team’s other highly acclaimed prospects, with James Wood (No. 11 per BA), Robert Hassell III and Brady House (No. 55) to his left. The idea had a care package from Scott Boras’s agency waiting for him; the box hardly would have stood out in the clubhouse if not for the fact that it was about 50 percent larger than any gift any other player received.\n\nNone of the hoopla has seemed to rock Crews. On his first day, he leaned back in his black folding chair, sipped from a cup of Dunkin’ and allowed clubhouse dynamics to marinate. He mostly kept to himself unless a teammate approached him, in which case he returned the favor with a quiet smile and a brief conversation that curled his mustache upward.\n\nBy Tuesday, his first day out in the open outside of the batting cages, he had slipped into his element, chatting away with his fellow prospects. When asked for his closest compatriot at camp, he pointed to Wood. “This tall guy right here,” he said. He warmed up with outfielder Lane Thomas and took his pointers during flyball drills.\n\n“Coming from a school like LSU, it almost gets you ready for the moments like this,” Crews said. “Playing in front of 10,000 people every day, that’s the most realistic [opportunity] you’ll get and the easiest transition you’ll get coming into a big new locker room like this or a packed-out stadium like you’ll do in the big leagues.”\n\nManager Dave Martinez has identified that poise, too. He called Crews a sponge. He said Crews had a sense of leadership and will have opportunities to play in spring training. Martinez wanted him to fit in. He didn’t have an estimate for Crews’s big league debut, but he was optimistic.\n\n“He’s going to help us,” Martinez said. “I don’t know when. It could be sooner than later. But he’s definitely going to help us — and help us win a lot of games here.”\n\nFor Martinez and General Manager Mike Rizzo, Crews’s summer of 2023 provided quite the springboard. Before the draft, the Florida native helped LSU to the national championship. In 14 games at low Class A Fredericksburg, he slugged five home runs and hit .355. He worked out with fellow LSU draft picks in the offseason and had a handful of weeks to get some sleep, fish and tweak his diet.\n\nIt wasn’t perfect: At the end of his 11-month stretch of baseball, he hit .208 in 20 games at Class AA Harrisburg. He called that time more mentally taxing than physically so. But he enjoyed the experience all the same. He has enjoyed his first days at camp, too. Seeing the fans was “really cool.”",

  "text": "“There are so many kids that need a home,” said Brittany Tyler, noting that over the past seven years, she and her husband have fostered 17 children for varying lengths of time.\n\nAt the time, the Tylers already adopted two children, and they wanted the baby boy from the firehouse to go to a loving home. They hoped it might be theirs.\n\n“I had assumed since it had been a few days, that they had already found a place for him to go,” Brittany Tyler said.\n\nBut four days after the baby was found and taken to a hospital, they got a call asking if they’d be willing to foster him. They happily accepted.\n\nThe boy was just over three pounds, and he stayed in the NICU for several weeks before moving in with the Tylers.\n\nBefore long, though, the baby was thriving — and enjoying life at his new home. The Tylers named him Samuel, and he officially became their son on Dec. 18, 2023.\n\n“When we first brought him home, they were so excited,” echoed his wife. “It’s really special to bring a new baby home. They were like ‘Can we keep this one?’”\n\nThat was always the Tylers’ goal. When a baby is surrendered to a designated safe place in Kentucky — such as a hospital, fire station, place of worship or police station — the process for terminating parental rights begins after 30 days.\n\nIn December of 2022, Samuel’s birth mother’s parental rights were terminated, paving the path for the Tylers to adopt him. Adoptions take time, the Tylers said, as there is ample paperwork to process, and the couple also had to renew some of their certifications and schedule a court date.\n\nAlthough Sam was tiny as a baby, he is now in the 80th percentile for size. He is in good health, his parents said, aside from some muscle tightness in his legs — for which he does physical therapy.\n\nSam will soon have another sibling, the Tylers said, as they are in the process of adopting a medically fragile little girl who they have been fostering for almost a year. She is eight months younger than Sam.\n\n“She needed to be removed from the care that she was in, and unfortunately, there just wasn’t any family that was able to take a child who was medically complex and needs to see a lot of doctors,” said Chris Tyler, explaining that they currently can’t share any more details about the child, including her name.\n\nThe Tylers have had training to look after medically complex children — which is what qualified them to care of Sam when he was considered medically fragile as an infant.\n\nWhile Sam wasn’t left in a Safe Haven Baby Box — which are drop-off locations that keep surrendered newborns safe — the Tylers hope that sharing his story will help raise awareness about them, as well as designated safe places.",

  "text": "It was just like any other Tuesday night. Elizabeth “Lisa” Lopez-Galvan was on air for her weekly radio show, “A Taste of Tejano,” sharing her love of music. The program features Tejano music, a “Tex-Mex” fusion of Mexican and American musical influences.“Let us know if you have a birthday, anniversary or special announcement!” Lopez-Galvan wrote on Facebook before her show, as she often did.\n\nOnce the show was over, she and her co-host, Tommy Andrade, parted ways — not knowing that it would be their last time together.\n\nPolice said one person was killed and 22 were injured but have not named any of the victims. Their ages range from 8 to 47 years old.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among “several” people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two, volunteered on the show before joining as a full-time programmer and co-host about two years ago, said Andrade, her co-host and family friend, remembering her as a kind person with an infectious smile. “She treated everyone she knew and loved as close family,” he told The Washington Post. “She will be missed.”\n\nAccording to Lopez-Galvan’s radio station, her adult son was shot in the leg at the rally but had been released from the hospital.\n\nIn a statement, the Lopez-Galvan family said: “We thank the community for their prayers and support during this difficult time. We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one … who was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.”\n\n“We ask to please keep our family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of Lisa’s death while also supporting our other loved ones who were impacted in this senseless act,” the statement said.\n\nAbarca choked up as he recalled his conversation Wednesday with one of Lopez-Galvan’s cousins. Both broke down in tears. Then the cousin told him: “What you need to do is do your job and change this.”\n\nThroughout her life, serving others was a key part of Lopez-Galvan’s life — from assisting people who didn’t speak English as a court clerk, to helping people in her community find jobs, according to a 2021 profile in the local newspaper Dos Mundos. She was bilingual in English and Spanish, her profile on KKFI said.\n\nIn an interview with Kansas City Hispanic News late last year, Lopez-Galvan credited her father, who played in local Mexican bands after arriving in Kansas City in his youth, for her love of music.\n\n“I just want to thank him, because if it wasn’t for him and the music I listened to growing up, I wouldn’t have this passion for music,” she said.\n\nThe last Facebook post she wrote before her final show — where she asked for birthdays, anniversaries or other special occasions — has now become a place for people to mourn a woman they never knew.\n\nBut for those who listened or knew her, it’s also a place to remember a kind individual who “always wanted to help others,” as one person wrote.",

  "text": "The violence forced emergency evacuations of the region’s top political leaders gathered for the parade and rally, including the governors of Missouri and Kansas and the mayor of Kansas City, who fled the shots with his wife and mother.\n\nThe incident reverberated around a country still shaken by several recent episodes of high-profile gun violence: In Houston, a woman burst into a megachurch between Sunday services and opened fire; in D. C., three police officers were shot while serving a warrant Wednesday; and just hours later, four students were wounded in a drive-by shooting outside of an Atlanta high school.\n\n“It’s absurd that we cannot celebrate our city’s victory without fearing for our lives at the same time,” Tara Bennett, a volunteer with the Kansas City chapter of Moms Demand Action who was at the parade, said in a statement.\n\nMissouri has among the nation’s highest rates of gun deaths and firearm ownership, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-safety advocacy group. The state also has some of the weakest gun-control laws in the country and its Republican leadership — who control both chambers of the legislature and the governorship — have shown little interest in passing further restrictions.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, Kansas City police had taken three people into custody and recovered multiple firearms, but they had not identified the suspects or the weapons, nor had they named any of the victims. Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a radio DJ and host of “Taste of Tejano” on Kansas City radio station KKFI, was killed in the shooting, according to Tommy Andrade, a family friend and co-host of the show. Andrade said Lopez-Galvan’s husband, Mike, informed him of her death. The station put out a statement calling her death a “senseless act.”\n\nGraves and other city leaders praised the parade’s security measures and the police response, saying the hundreds of officers already on the scene acted fast and prevented further bloodshed. The shooting occurred, despite the heavy police presence, because of “bad actors,” Graves said.\n\nWednesday’s festivities marked Kansas City’s third Super Bowl victory in five years, and the day’s party started off just like the others. Fans arrived early on an unseasonably warm Midwest day. They lined the streets, draped in Chiefs gear, holding signs and waving team flags as they jockeyed for position, trying to catch a glimpse of the players as they bounded past.\n\nLocal hero and star quarterback Patrick Mahomes swaggered down the parade route, slapping hands with fans and unzipping his jacket to show off a bare chest. Travis Kelce, the team’s all-pro tight end and boyfriend to Taylor Swift, dropped to one knee and chugged a beer as the crowd around him roared.\n\nPolice responded to the first shots shortly after the team’s players and coaches delivered remarks at the rally outside the train station. Videos posted on social media showed spectators rushing from the area as police ran inside the historic building. Other videos showed responders aiding victims on the ground outside.\n\nKansas City interim fire chief Ross Grundyson told reporters that of the 21 injured victims, eight had “immediately life-threatening” injuries and seven had “life-threatening injuries.” Six others were considered to have “minor” injuries. A spokesperson for Kansas City’s Children’s Mercy hospital confirmed to The Washington Post that the facility was treating 12 patients from the shooting, 11 of whom were children.\n\n“For this joy to be turned to tragedy today in Kansas City cuts deep in the American soul,” he said. “Today’s events should move us, shock us, shame us into acting. What are we waiting for? What else do we need to see? How many more families need to be torn apart?”\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson (R), who attended the parade with his wife, said it was a “tragic conclusion to a celebration we had all looked forward to.” And Gov. Laura Kelly (D) of Kansas said she was evacuated and that the “senseless act of violence goes against everything Kansas City and the Chiefs Kingdom stand for.”",

  "text": "LAWRENCE, Kan. — Two juveniles held after gunfire exploded at the end of a crowded rally for the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory — killing one and injuring nearly two dozen others — have been criminally charged, authorities said Friday. They were charged Thursday with gun-related offenses and resisting arrest, Jackson County family court officials said in a statement. The two were being held in a juvenile detention facility.\n\nWhat police described as a dispute among several people outside the city’s Union Station on Wednesday sent fans scattering and fleeing over barricades as police and first responders — some 800 were on hand — descended upon the chaotic scene. Three people were taken into custody — including one who was tackled by Chiefs fans — a short time later. An adult detainee was later released.\n\nSgt. Jacob P. Becchina, a spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department, said in an email Friday that the teens had been held as authorities worked with juvenile prosecutors to determine the charges. The juvenile court system will determine their custody status, Becchina said.\n\nThe statement said that while the juveniles had been detained on “gun-related and resisting arrest” charges, “additional charges are expected in the future as the investigation by the Kansas City Police Department continues.”\n\nPolice have not revealed details about guns used in the shooting, besides saying several weapons were recovered. Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Washington Post in an interview Thursday that the “biggest challenge” for police in his Missouri city is the modification of firearms as well as “the ongoing presence of semiautomatic weapons.”\n\nOn Friday, musician Taylor Swift — who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — donated $100,000 to the family of Elizabeth “Lisa” Lopez-Galvan, the Johnson County woman who was killed Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two adult children, was a popular local DJ who hosted a program called “A Taste of Tejano” on the Kansas City radio station KKFI. The trade publication Variety first reported the donation, and the Associated Press verified the posts.\n\n“Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss. With love, Taylor Swift,” the singer wrote on the Lopez-Galvan’s memorial GoFundMe page.\n\nThe shooting devastated the Kansas City community, and came at the end of what was a storybook season for the Chiefs, after the team overcame initial struggles to take its second consecutive Super Bowl title in an overtime victory against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nOn Friday, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, visited some of the injured children at a hospital, according to photos posted on social media.\n\nMahomes announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the Chiefs had established an emergency response fund for “victims and their families, violence prevention and mental health services, and first responders.”",

  "text": "As year three of its war with Russia begins, Ukraine’s forces are exhausted and depleted, ammunition supplies are running low, and the country just suffered a morale-busting defeat in Avdiivka, retreating after four months of grueling combat to defend the town. The United States had helped Ukraine beat back Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, yet, at this critical moment, Congress is wavering. At stake is not just the survival of democracy in Ukraine but also the future of Europe, international peace and the United States’ credibility.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) can bring a Senate-passed Ukraine aid bill to the floor, where it likely has the votes to pass. His refusal so far — bowing to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump — is a gross dereliction of responsibility, hurting Ukraine, the United States and the Republican Party.\n\nAt the two-year mark, Ukraine is not defeated. When the full-scale Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022, Mr. Putin’s orders included “the murder of Ukraine’s executive branch and the capture of parliament,” while Russian security services and military rehearsed “kill-or-capture” missions to find those behind Ukraine’s pro-democracy Maidan Revolution in 2014. The plans anticipated seizing Ukraine’s national heating, electricity and financial operations to subjugate the population. Mr. Putin assumed Ukrainians would submit in a matter of days. But none of this happened. Despite devastating losses, Ukraine rallied to fight back. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was not murdered, its army has fought with courage and cunning, its air defenses have downed hundreds of missiles, and Ukraine has disabled one-third of Russia’s Black Sea fleet by the use of unmanned naval drones. Russia occupies just under one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea and Donbas taken in 2014.\n\nBut Ukraine’s war effort is precarious, as the rushed retreat from Avdiivka showed. Hundreds of Ukrainian solders were reported captured or killed in the chaos. Russia massed troops on three sides of the city and then cut off the last Ukrainian path out. The Russian forces threw wave after wave of assault troops at the Ukrainian holdouts, who were outnumbered 7 to 1. A Ukrainian major fighting there was quoted by the New York Times as saying in December, “I would say the motto of their attacks is, ‘We have more people than you have ammunition, bullets, rockets and shells.’”\n\nThis defeat explains Ukraine’s vulnerability — it is smaller than Russia and depends on the United States and Europe to sustain the war. If it cannot keep fighting, there will be more Avdiivkas, or worse. Only Ukraine can solve its serious personnel problem; a platoon commander estimated for Reuters that just 60 to 70 percent of the several thousand men in his brigade at the start of the conflict were still serving. A new troop mobilization bill is moving through parliament. But the West can help Ukraine with weapons supplies. The pause since the last U. S. funds ran out has created a dire shortage of artillery and ammunition, permitting Ukraine to fire just one shot for every five Russia discharges.\n\nMr. Putin, marshaling Russia’s larger economy and manpower, seems prepared to accept devastating losses indefinitely. He must see the Johnson-Trump roadblock in Congress as encouraging. Mr. Putin has imposed a totalitarian hold on Russia, so he does not face any serious internal political challenge. After the harsh treatment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, sent to a frigid prison above the Arctic Circle, where he died a week ago, Russians are not likely to protest. Ksenia Khavana, a 33-year-old dual Russian American citizen from Los Angeles who was visiting her parents in Yekaterinburg, was detained on charges of “treason” for her $51 contribution two years ago to a Ukrainian charity. A 72-year-old woman was sentenced to 5½ years in prison for disseminating “fake news” about the Russian military in two reposts on the social media platform VKontakte.\n\nUkraine seeks to escape this kind of dictatorship; its aspirations are democratic. Fortunately, European nations seem to be growing more aware of the threat from Russia, helping to fill — but far from making up for — the huge assistance gap the United States has left.\n\nRepublicans used to champion democratic values against the tyranny of the Soviet Union and Mr. Putin’s Russia, not only to advance freedom but also to build enduring international partnerships through which free peoples prospered. This posture served the nation for generations. Now, a Republican House speaker and a Republican presidential front-runner are blocking aid to Ukraine at this pivotal time.\n\nMr. Johnson has Ukraine’s future in his hands, as well as the commitments of the United States. He can save both from becoming casualties of Russia’s aggression.",

  "text": "The deadly shooting that turned a celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs into a tragedy on Wednesday appeared to stem from a dispute among several people and had “no nexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism,” officials said Thursday morning. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a briefing that two of three people detained are juveniles. None has been charged yet, and additional detentions or arrests are possible, she said.\n\nThe shooting occurred about 2 p.m. amid a crowd of fans outside the city’s Union Station as the parade and rally for the Super Bowl champions drew to a close. At the sound of gunfire, people fled in every direction while police and first responders began swarming the scene. The three people were taken into custody a short time later.\n\nOne woman was killed and 22 people were injured in a matter of minutes. The victims’ ages range from 8 to 47, Graves said, and at least half are younger than 16.\n\n“This incident is still a very active investigation,” she noted. Authorities must charge the people in custody within 24 hours or release them, she said, adding that “we have all intentions of presenting charges.”\n\nA statement from the University Health hospital in Kansas City said three gunshot victims remained there Thursday, including two in critical condition. Saint Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City was continuing to treat one victim, who was still listed as in critical condition Thursday. Children’s Mercy had received a dozen victims, nine with gunshot wounds, in the aftermath of the rally. All are expected to recover, according to a hospital spokesperson.\n\nThe city continued to clean up the scene, which was still littered Thursday morning after with fans’ folding chairs, Chiefs regalia, and red and yellow confetti. The Jackson County prosecutor’s office was offering counseling services for members of the public feeling traumatized by what they had witnessed.\n\n“We are seeing more things with a lot of people getting hit, even unintentionally. I’m not going to get ahead of the facts here, but it is something that I think is a very real concern,” he said.\n\n“I’d be lying to you if I didn’t say that we’ll probably evaluate in the event that we’re blessed to have another Super Bowl championship,” Lucas said in an interview Thursday morning, wondering whether future gatherings would need to be held at a stadium or other location where attendees would be wanded at security checkpoints.\n\nThe shooting was the latest to upend a community’s celebration with deadly violence. And with parades coming up on St. Patrick’s Day next month, “my city and many American cities will be tested,” Lucas said. “Is this just something we live with in the same way that we’re living with school shootings and the threat to movie theaters and the threat to bowling alleys?”\n\nLucas said he had spoken Thursday morning with Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) about a 2022 shooting — allegedly by a 21-year-old man armed with an semiautomatic rifle — that left seven people dead and several dozen wounded at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill. Lucas said he told Pritzker that “I shouldn’t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.”\n\nOne security expert, Michael Chertoff, former secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security, also raised the issue of ensuring safety with such open events. In a stadium, he noted, “you can screen people for bringing in weapons or things that are dangerous, potential bombs. And you also can funnel them in through a portal that gives you control over everybody who comes in. Obviously, when you’re dealing with the street, you don’t have that capability.”\n\nOfficials declined Thursday to comment on the kinds of weapons used in the parade shooting. Missouri, which has some of the nation’s laxest gun laws, has no age minimum for possession of a firearm, though federal law prohibits minors from possessing handguns except in rare circumstances. A bill that Missouri legislators passed three years ago declared federal gun laws invalid and prohibited state and local authorities from enforcing them, but that law is tied up in court.\n\nThe Kansas City Council last August passed two ordinances to strengthen gun laws in the city. One measure banned specific weapons, including machine guns, firearm silencers and components, such as bump stocks, that turn semiautomatic guns into fully automatic weapons. The other prohibited the transfer of weapons, including ammunition, to minors. The mayor said at the time that he believed the ordinances complied with state law.",

  "text": "Lilly Baker was driving to meet some friends in Limestone County, Ala., earlier this month, when she spotted a woman with a wheelchair who was struggling to cross the railroad tracks on foot.“She was just walking along the train tracks with her wheelchair in front of her. She was using it as a stabilizer,” said Baker, 18, adding that the woman was laboring as she tried to walk. Since her wheelchair couldn’t clear the tracks, she was attempting to use it help her walk across — but she was stuck.\n\n“I got out of my car and I went over to her, and by the time I got to her, the lights started flashing on the train and the horn was going off,” recalled Baker, who lives in Athens, Ala. “I grabbed her from behind her arms and I tried to pick her up and walk with her, and we fell.”\n\nOne more time, as the train drew terrifyingly near, “I grabbed as hard as I could to get her out of there,” she continued, explaining that she pulled the woman by her jacket.\n\nBaker narrowly saved the woman’s life — and her own. An employee of the railroad company, CSX, later told Baker the train was less than 20 inches away from hitting them both.\n\n“My adrenaline was rushing,” said Baker, noting that she sat with the woman — who seemed disoriented and was in pain — at the side of the train tracks. Baker saw a nearby worker and told them to call an ambulance, as her cellphone was still in the car.\n\n“I was just sitting there crying,” Baker said, adding that the train operator halted the train and came to check on them right away.\n\n“Due to medical reasons, she is not able to be interviewed at this moment,” Robison said, explaining that she lives in an apartment building across from the train tracks, and on the day Baker saved her, the woman was taking a shortcut after she left her home.\n\n“I think it’s one of the bravest acts I’ve ever seen,” said Robison, who has been a police officer for 20 years. “For an 18-year-old girl who is not big in stature to risk her life to save somebody else, she just showed that bravery comes in all shapes and sizes.”\n\nBaker said her parents are proud — and relieved that both she and the woman are safe. The Limestone County Commission presented Baker with an award for her heroism on Tuesday.",

(Julia Maguire)Mother-daughter relationships are complicated, and mine is no exception. Given our complex 18-year history, I assumed that when she embarked on her new life as a college freshman she would flee from me like a gazelle narrowly escaping the jaws of a crocodile. I also accepted that our conversations — which have become increasingly disjointed in her teen years — would cease until Thanksgiving. But I was wrong.Without fail, at 8 p.m., she FaceTimes me, and not only talks for over an hour but also asks questions that she’d never asked before, like “What did you do today?”The first time she posed that question I was positive I had misheard her. I wondered, “Did she actually just ask me a question?” Typically, I was the one, as she so eloquently phrased it, “interrogating her” or barraging her with aggravating inquiries, like “How was your day at school?”Instead of responding, my mind ran through all the ways I might have misunderstood. Perhaps she had asked: “What did you say?” or “What is today?” or the least plausible, “What is hearsay?”I think the root of our issues originated in the womb. During the last three months of my pregnancy, my daughter’s derrière prodded my right rib, inflicting continuous pain. While experiencing the jabs of discomfort, I dreamed of the day when I would finally meet my baby. But little did I know that dreaming or any type of sleep would be impossible for the next six months. After all, who can sleep to the soundtrack of incessant newborn crying?I’d only met my neighbor a few times. When she died I took in her dog.The toddler years proved to be more harmonious. She preferred to be within my orbit, waddling behind me like a baby duckling. Her infectious giggles could brighten even the most despondent demeanor. And dare I admit that her strong-willed nature was endearing?The preschool years were even better. Mundane tasks like grocery shopping were transformed into a celebratory event with my daughter beside me in her princess gown and bedazzled tiara. She’d greet the customers who passed by us with a royal wave while they complimented her attire. So when all these moments came to an unceremonious halt, I was dumbfounded.In hindsight, my college degree in developmental psychology should have prepared me for the teenage years. My knowledge of normal adolescent behavior in all its glory and of teens’ need to assert their independence should have helped me cope. Instead, I was exasperated. Overnight it seemed as if my communicative cub turned into a surly one-worded bear who only knew the word “no.” On rare occasions a few other words would be peppered in, like “I don’t know.”Besides the lack of communication, there was the continuously closed door to her room that signaled, “I no longer prefer to be anywhere near your orbit.” This distance, I’ll admit, led me to overcompensate by conducting inquisitions whenever she was within 10 feet of me.I’d seldom see the former princess from the grocery store, but occasionally, she’d emerge willingly to engage in conversation. Since these times were so infrequent, I had low expectations that she’d stay in touch once she went to a school more than 200 miles away.At first, I chalked up her daily FaceTime calls to homesickness. But after the initial separation period passed, and she continued to call, my assessment of her behavior shifted. Like a detective I noticed how she voluntarily divulged details about her day or appeared genuinely intrigued when I rattled off a list of quotidian tasks I completed. She willingly offered information like the meal she consumed for dinner, the drama among dorm mates and the assignments she struggled with — all without any coercion. My astute deduction was that we were having an actual conversation!He ‘gentle parents’ the squirrels on his balcony. Millions now watch.The regularity of her calls transformed me into a Pavlovian dog. Each day, I’d eye the passing minutes with barely contained anticipation for our nightly conversations. In much the same way the Earth’s orbit around the sun changes over time, so does the mother-daughter relationship. (Yes, she approved this essay.)After being away for three months, she returned home for Thanksgiving, and our magical conversations disappeared into whatever vortex they had materialized from. The one-word sentences re-emerged along with the closed doors. When my husband noticed my melancholy mood he proposed a simple solution, albeit one that seemed absurd.Reluctantly I pressed the FaceTime icon on my phone and waited in the living room for her to answer from one floor above me.“Why are you calling me?” she asked with a hint of irritation.“It’s time for our daily call,” I replied in a matter-of-fact tone.Like the Cinderella princess she pretended to be in the grocery store, she played along with her mother’s outlandish ruse, talking for her usual 60 minutes. The mere illusion of being 200 miles away seemed to revive her ability to have a conversation with me. Hopefully one day we can transition to IRL.Cheryl Maguire holds a Master of Counseling Psychology degree. She is a married mother of twins and a daughter.

C. police officers serving an arrest warrant related to animal cruelty were shot and wounded Wednesday morning near Benning Park in Southeast Washington, prompting a nearly 13-hour standoff that ended when the suspect surrendered, authorities said.Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning.The armed standoff in the 5000 block of Hanna Place SE came to a close just before 9 p.m., having disrupted schools and forced neighbors out of their homes along a street with small brick houses and plots of grass. Police confirmed Wednesday night that the suspect had been arrested and charged with cruelty to animals. They said charges related to the shooting of the officers were pending.\n\nOn Wednesday night, police identified the suspect as Julius James, 46, of Southeast Washington. But on Thursday, a police spokesman said that name was an alias. The suspect’s real name is Stephen Claude Rattigan, and he is 48, the spokesman said\n\nAuthorities said the officers who were shot were not seriously injured. The chairman of the police union said one was struck in the ankle, another in the calf and a third was hit twice in a ballistic vest, suffering bruises but avoiding what could have been critical wounds. Police said a fourth officer was hurt but not by gunfire.\n\nThe spasm of violence upended daily life in Southeast and served as yet another reminder of D. C.’s struggles with crime. Parents navigated around roadblocks to pick up their children, who in turn walked by crime scene tape on their way home. Residents were locked inside their homes or barred from returning to them. The city opened an emergency center to help residents who needed a place to stay.\n\nSmith said the officers with the Criminal Apprehension Unit were serving a warrant on behalf of the Humane Rescue Alliance, charging a suspect with cruelty to animals. Details of the allegations in the warrant were not revealed. About 8:15 p.m., officers could be seen leading dogs away from the residence on leashes; the Humane Rescue Alliance later said it had removed 31 dogs — 20 adults and 11 puppies — from the home, and they were being cared for at a secure location.\n\nPolice radio captured the chaos that ensued. At 8:06 a.m., a police officer called a “10-33,” code for an emergency, into dispatch. “Shots fired. Multiple officers have been hit. I have two officers down,” the officer said, according to radio transmissions from openmhz.com, which allows people to listen to live and archived radio transmission from police and fire departments.\n\n“There have been periods of time throughout the day where he has been shooting, which is why we have ensured we don’t want anyone in that area,” the chief said. “We have been in communication with him. … There were moments where he was very agitated, and there were moments where he was very positive.”\n\nSmith said at the briefing that police were prepared for a long standoff. “We will tolerate this as long as we continue to engage with the subject to get him to surrender to our law enforcement personnel,” she said.\n\nThat time, her oldest son, 22-year-old Nico Dukes, had been fatally shot. She said police have since arrested a man that had grown up alongside Nico. Nasir knew that his big brother had gone to heaven and that police officers had been around his house during that period. Nneka Dukes figured the yellow tape and sirens circling his school Wednesday must have reminded him of Nico.\n\nBut as he trudged out of the building Wednesday, still looking down, he turned to his mom and said, “I don’t want to come to school tomorrow.” Nneka Dukes said she tried to counsel him: “We don’t know what tomorrow is going to hold.”\n\nDown the street from at least two armored vehicles and officers carrying rifles were Grace Bell, 63, and her dog, Chloe. They were on an afternoon stroll through their neighborhood, where Bell has lived for the last 12 years.\n\nShe said that a man had moved into a house where police were focused Wednesday less than a year ago and that he was known to have dogs that could be out of control.\n\nDuring a news briefing at the scene, Smith said there are too many illegal firearms on the street, and she urged D. C. Council members to pass the final version of a crime bill that would increase penalties for some gun crimes.",

  "text": "A woman wielding a long gun is dead and the child who was with her is in critical condition after the woman walked into a Texas evangelical megachurch on Sunday afternoon in Houston and opened fire, police said. Off-duty law enforcement officers confronted the woman shortly after she entered the massive Lakewood Church building just before 2 p.m., when the church was changing between English and Spanish-speaking services, according to Houston Police Chief Troy Finner.\n\nThe woman fired several rounds and indicated she had a bomb before officers fired back, killing her and injuring the 5-year-old boy who was with her. Police did not elaborate on the child’s relationship to the woman.\n\nThe child was taken to a children’s hospital in critical condition. A 56-year-old man who was attending services suffered a gunshot wound to the hip, city fire officials said.\n\nThe shooting set off panic inside the cavernous nondenominational church, which is home to Joel Osteen’s global ministry, welcomes nearly 45,000 worshipers weekly and broadcasts to more than 100 countries. It is the one of the largest megachurches in the nation. Witnesses told reporters that they barricaded themselves inside closets and took cover behind pillars as the shots rang out.\n\nA live stream of the service on YouTube captured the sound of loud bangs coming from behind a speaker in front of the camera giving announcements in Spanish. Law enforcement evacuated businesses in a busy commercial center of Houston amid early reports of a second shooter. However, the situation involved just one shooter, Finner said.\n\nA visibly shaken Osteen said during a news conference Sunday that he did not know why such things happen but was assured that “God is in control.”\n\nWhile fans of all faiths read and watch Osteen for his general, encouraging words, he is controversial among other Christians who note his near-total silence on topics such as sin and doctrine.\n\nPolice and fire officials said the woman was wearing a trench coat and carried a backpack when she entered the church. Finner said she sprayed a substance as she entered the west side of the building, which prompted police to run a complete sweep of the downtown building that was once a basketball stadium. A bomb-detecting robot was also deployed as a precaution to inspect the white vehicle they say the woman drove to the church.\n\nOfficers from multiple agencies executed a search warrant on a home about 50 miles north of Houston early Monday in connection with the shooting, according to Mike Holley, a spokesman for Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office. They searched for evidence connected to aggravated assault, possession of a prohibited weapon and a hoax bomb, Holley said.\n\nThe newly elected Democratic mayor of Houston, John Whitmire, who ran on a law-and-order platform, praised the Houston area agencies for their prompt and collaborative response to the active shooter.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that on a day we want to attend church and watch America’s No. 1 sports event that we find ourselves gathering to respond to this tragedy,” he said.\n\nLifeway Research, owned by the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, did a survey of Protestant pastors last year. It found that by far the most popular security plans pastors have are an “intentional plan for an active shooter” and armed congregants. Fifty-four percent of the pastors polled said they have a plan involving armed churchgoers. Three years earlier, that number was 45 percent, Lifeway said.",

  "text": "TAMPA — For the first time in more than three months, the Washington Capitals have won three straight games in regulation. Playoff hopes, however faint, are flickering. And with the March 8 trade deadline looming, they have found a level of consistency that has been absent most of the campaign. It wasn’t always smooth sailing Thursday night against the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amalie Arena, but after seeing their two-goal lead evaporate in just 24 seconds early in the third period, the Capitals got back on top with a late game-winner from defenseman Rasmus Sandin to beat the Lightning, 5-3. Goaltender Charlie Lindgren made 29 saves on 32 shots for Washington, winning his second consecutive start. Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 19 of 23 for Tampa Bay.\n\n“We were just so composed. … It played out the way that you thought,” Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Even after giving up those two goals quickly, the composure on the bench, our next shifts after that, you could just tell it wasn’t a team that was rattled. It wasn’t a team that was going to let a couple bad scenarios determine our fate.”\n\nFor the first two periods, the Capitals were largely in control. In his return to the lineup after being a healthy scratch the previous two games, winger Nicolas Aube-Kubel put the Capitals ahead just 2:30 into the first period.\n\nBeck Malenstyn, Aube-Kubel’s fellow fourth-line winger, forced a turnover along the end boards with a heavy hit on defenseman Emil Lilleberg, and Aube-Kubel tracked down the puck as it slid toward the blue line. Once he corralled it, Aube-Kubel bounced the puck off the half-wall — around Tampa Bay center Anthony Cirelli — and back to himself before working in on Vasilevskiy and lifting a backhand over the netminder.\n\nCenter Connor McMichael doubled Washington’s lead late in the first period after winger Tom Wilson’s hit on defenseman Haydn Fleury took him out of the play. Wilson picked up the puck after the hit and fed it to defenseman Joel Edmundson, who found McMichael for a quick-release wrister that beat Vasilevskiy.\n\nBrandon Hagel halved the Lightning’s deficit midway through the second period, firing a wrist shot past Lindgren while using center Dylan Strome as a screen, but it took Strome less than three minutes to help Washington back to a two-goal advantage. After Hagel’s goal, Carbery swapped his forward lines, putting winger Anthony Mantha with Strome and winger T. J. Oshie and slotting captain Alex Ovechkin with McMichael and Wilson.\n\n“I felt like I needed to make a switch there to try to change momentum because you could feel it coming,” Carbery said. “And then they end up getting a goal, so we decided to make an adjustment there. Just make it harder for [Tampa Bay Lightning Coach Jon Cooper] to go after a matchup that he was looking for.”\n\nStrome was sent to the penalty box for slashing with 2:33 left in the second period, giving the NHL’s top power play a chance to swing the momentum before intermission. But Washington, despite being without its top penalty-killing forward in Nic Dowd, killed the penalty without allowing Tampa Bay a single shot on net.\n\nThe Lightning quickly pulled back the momentum in the opening minutes of the third period. Tampa Bay scored two goals just 24 seconds apart, and the Capitals’ comfortable lead vanished. For the first of the two tallies, forward Nick Paul caught defenseman Ethan Bear flat-footed deep off the rush and wheeled around Bear before cutting to the front of the net and completing the solo effort with a shot that found the back of the net.\n\nFor the second, Tyler Motte took advantage of a turnover in the corner, popping into the slot with a clear lane to beat Lindgren over the shoulder. Strome looked to have put Washington back into the lead moments later, but the goal was taken off the board after a successful offside challenge by the Lightning.\n\nStrome went to the penalty box again with 10:35 left in the third period, this time for tripping Hagel. But the Capitals again kept Tampa Bay from capitalizing on the man advantage, even as the Lightning generated several dangerous looks. And immediately after Strome’s penalty expired, Hagel was sent to the box for high-sticking McMichael.\n\n“You want to do something better for the guy that goes down,” defenseman John Carlson said. “It was a good effort from everybody to stay composed and to keep pressing.”\n\nThey were rewarded with 4:59 left remaining when Sandin converted on a wide-open chance in the slot to put Washington back into the lead — and this time, the go-ahead goal remained on the board. McMichael hit the empty net with 1:02 remaining for his second consecutive multi-goal game.\n\n“It’s that time of year,” Carlson said. “There’s been some big blocks here and there. Some huge saves. Some big penalty kills, some big [power play] goals. You need all those things to have a successful run in this league and certainly at this time of year against good teams.”\n\nNote: Washington recalled winger Pierrick Dube on Wednesday from the Hershey Bears, its American Hockey League affiliate, in response to Dowd’s injury. Dube, who is tied for second in the AHL with 24 goals, was a healthy scratch Thursday as Aube-Kubel drew back into the lineup.",

  "text": "236 minutes of terror at MSU: Barricaded with a gunman on the looseWarning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. EAST LANSING — A senior pre-med student was doing homework at his desk. A junior was out to dinner with friends. And a sophomore was in her usual spot at the union, blasting Metallica’s “Harvester of Sorrow” through her AirPods.It was a typical Monday night at Michigan State University, one of the country’s largest colleges, an institution known for its groundbreaking research and boisterous school spirit. Students had their minds on exams, Valentine’s Day, Spring Break.But a few minutes after 8 p.m., the crack of gunshots ruptured the rhythm of campus life, sending those same students running in fear. They barricaded themselves in rooms, cut the lights and grabbed kitchen knives in case the gunman who had just opened fire in two campus buildings decided to target them next.Almost everyone here on this campus of 50,000 students grew up with the threat of school shootings. A few had survived them before — at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 or at Oxford High School in 2021. Many more had lived through close calls, false alarms and lockdowns, preparing for gun violence at their schools the way they drill for fires and tornadoes. Now in college — a place that was supposed to be a sanctuary, where young people could find themselves on the way to adulthood — the nightmare was unfolding all over again.But the rampage that killed three and injured five more in East Lansing played out in a particularly frightening way. Nearly four hours elapsed between the police department’s initial shelter-in-place order and its message alerting the campus community that the shooter was dead. It was 236 minutes of terror.Students at MSU barricaded themselves in a dorm room after a gunman opened fired at a building on campus on Feb. 13. (Video: Olivia Gilcher)In school buildings, dorms and off-campus houses, students and staff huddled together, transforming their rooms into fortresses and feverishly refreshing their phones for updates. News — and rumor — travels fast on college campuses. Students desperate for information tuned in to publicly accessible police scanners, relaying intel to group chats and social media.What they heard was unconfirmed and often inaccurate: The shooter was in their building, he was planting bombs, he was not alone. But at the time, they had no way of knowing these reports were false. They just knew they were scared, and all they could do was wait.“It felt like you were being hunted,” said Josey Bruce, a junior who was hiding in her attic.The Washington Post interviewed more than 40 Michigan State students to reconstruct a detailed account of a horrifying evening. This is their story, part of a generation’s American college experience.Police investigate the scene of a shooting at Berkey Hall on the campus of Michigan State University on late Monday. (Al Goldis/AP)It began at 8:18 p.m. with a volley of gunfire inside Berkey Hall, an old building of red brick and stone where most of the school’s social sciences classes are held.The voice of a 911 dispatcher crackled over the police scanner.Then the calls flooded in. One said the shooter was moving through a Berkey hallway. Another warned of victims in a classroom. Before long, the callers reported, the shooter was heading west, toward the MSU Union, the beating heart of student activity.Michigan State students evacuate to a safer area during an active shooter situation on the campus. (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)People shelter inside the Broad Art Museum near Berkey Hall on Monday. (Al Goldis/AP)At the time, Emi Lila was inside the building at a table near the food hall, where she spent nearly every evening downing cups of coffee and chipping away at homework.About 8:25 p.m. she heard a slam over the Metallica blaring in her headphones. Then two bangs, one after another. Someone ran from the food court, so Lila and her roommate followed.“I didn’t think it was a gun at first,” she said. “But we were just running, and I’m just gonna keep running.”They jumped down a flight of stairs and ran for the back door with a group of other students. Olivia Gilcher, a first-year who was also in the Union, did the same.Students on Michigan State University's campus ran away from the sound of gunshots on Feb. 13. (Video: Olivia Gilcher)When they made it outside, Gilcher said it felt calm, almost like nothing was happening. By 8:28 p.m., Lila was outside, too. Police cars clustered nearby, sirens blaring.As they fled, the university sent out its first communique, ordering students to shelter in place. “Run, Hide, Fight,” the message read.MSU Police report shots fired incident occurring on or near the East Lansing campus. Secure-in-Place immediately. Run, Hide, Fight. Run means evacuate away from danger if you can do so safely, Hide means to secure-in-place, and Fight means protect yourself if no other option. Monitor alert.msu.edu for information.From a nearby apartment building overlooking the Union, sophomore Karleigh Duffield thought she heard a gunshot. Then she saw police running on the street below, read the school’s message and knew.“Is everyone all good,” she asked in a group chat at 8:33 p.m.If you live in north and you go outside I’ll punch you.A minute later, her friend Brooke Cibor replied that she had seen the school’s email. Cibor’s father called her soon after and told her to stay out of sight, below the window in her room. She would, she told her dad, but she had to get off the phone — she needed to focus.The training from countless lockdown drills kicked in. Cibor and three friends yanked shut the shades on her ground-floor windows. They shoved furniture in front of their door, turned off the lights and took their places next to a fridge and beneath a desk.Jillian Plant, 20, and other MSU students frantically checked in with one another and offered advice to stay safe over texts and Snapchat. (Jillian Plant)LEFT: Four students propped up furniture against a dorm room entrance to hide from a gunman on Feb. 13 on Michigan State's campus. (Brooke Cibor) RIGHT: Jillian Plant, 20, and other MSU students frantically checked in with one another and offered advice to stay safe over texts and Snapchat. (Jillian Plant) “Nothing was processing,” Cibor said. “I was just thinking what would I do if he came in. I felt like a sitting duck.”When Frank Falzetta first saw the alert, its magnitude didn’t register — the school sends security emails often, and people have fired guns on campus before. Soon, though, the junior realized this was different. He pushed the couch in front of the door at his apartment in Cedar Village, a student neighborhood half a mile from the scene, and grabbed the best weapon he could find: a long kitchen knife.By then, the shooting had ended. But for the next several hours, reports of other attacks, all false, would make their way through group texts and onto the police scanner.Around 9 p.m., at her house across the street from Berkey, Bruce texted her father.He called her right back: “What do you mean?” he asked her. He hadn’t seen the news. They quickly hashed out a plan. Bruce and her two roommates would turn off the lights and lock themselves in their attic.At 9:14 p.m., an unidentified surveillance camera captured a man who fit the shooter’s description walking down an alley. Seconds later, a fleet of police and SWAT vehicles sped by on the adjacent street. After they passed, the man doubled back.Two minutes later, MSU police advised: “The suspect is believed to be on foot right now.”As he walked, thousands of students listened to the police scanner. They were bent beneath tables and gathered in basements, listening to the traffic at a whisper in case the shooter was inside their building. Many had no bathrooms, no food, no water.From her attic, Bruce and her roommates followed his reported movements. Bruce’s father and stepmother did, too, from their house in Oakland County, roughly 75 miles east of campus. They pulled up Google Maps while they listened to the scanner and measured the distance between their daughter and the latest location mentioned.“It was basically like listening to a play-by-play sports game,” Bruce said, but the scariest one imaginable. “They’re getting closer and closer — that’s how it felt.”Around 9:20 p.m., 911 dispatchers were receiving call after call from Snyder-Phillips, two large and connected residential halls. Haig Kadian, a junior who lives off-campus, was checking on his friends. At 9:23 p.m., one responded that they were in the building next door.right next to sny phiOh shit stay put do not go out shut your blinds and TURN YOUR LIGHTS OFFThe view from Haig Kadian's apartment next to campus, as he watched a swarm of police cars respond to reports of shots fired. (Haig Kadian)There never was a shooting at Snyder-Phillips, but in a pattern that would repeat itself throughout the night, reported incidents broadcast on the police scanner seemed to fuel panic, which in turn led to more 911 calls.The rumors often spread over text. One friend warned Cibor that everyone was under threat.They r saying it might be an attack on every hallOn at least one occasion, the inaccurate information came straight from an official police channel.Just before 9:30, MSU authorities tweeted that another shooting had been reported at IM East, a student gym more than a mile southeast of the Union. A few minutes later, the account followed up, saying the gym was “being secured” and, for the first time, telling students there was only one suspect. No shots were ever fired at IM East.MSU students during the active-shooter situation on Monday. (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)Among peers, communication reached a frenzied level, blurring the line between fact and rumor in message threads with dozens of participants. But students also spent most of those early minutes checking in with friends, acquaintances, exes and high school classmates they hadn’t spoken with in years. They swapped tips and told one another to stay safe.Word spread that Lila had been inside the Union during the shooting.“ARE YOU OKAY,” texted one friend, and then another.and the guys tooYes bro we’re you in therei was right there broSo many of America’s high-profile mass shootings occur in split seconds and frantic minutes, like Lila’s brush with danger. But on this night, the horror lasted long after the final shot was fired.Around 9:30 p.m., 911 dispatch began receiving calls that the shooter could be in Cedar Village. Falzetta, who lives there with his friends, got a similar call. “Frank, I think I saw him move,” a buddy told him. “He’s coming your way.”Falzetta hung up and texted his apartment group chat.“Stay in your bathrooms and lock both doors,” a neighbor replied.He was apparently sighted in cvStay in your bathrooms and lock both doorsLess than 10 minutes later, police released the first description of the suspect, calling him a “short male with a mask, possibly Black.” The Twitter post added: “We are still receiving multiple calls of an active shooter on campus.”Eight minutes later, authorities sent an email alert with more chilling language: “A person is actively shooting at the East Lansing campus.”A person is actively shooting at the East Lansing campus. This is an active and ongoing situation. Follow the Run, Hide and Fight guidelines. Secure in place; turn cell phones to silent; remain quite. Suspect description: short male with mask, possibly black male.David Booth, a senior studying to be a doctor, was hunkered down in his house a few minutes from the shooting scenes. He had two couches against the door and his heart was pounding. At one point, a helicopter flew so close that it shook his walls.When he saw the first reports about victims being transported to a hospital, he wished he could be there, rendering aid.“I wanted to be out there helping everyone,” he said. “But I can’t do anything — I’m not there yet.”In dorms across campus, resident advisers worked to counter the deluge of false reports.Eleanor Hoss, a senior and RA in Armstrong Hall, messaged her residents at 10:27 p.m., trying to dispel the rumor that police were using gun shots to clear buildings.Just got this from my boss:\n\nthere is a rumor that police are using gun shots to clear buildings. This is Not true. If you hear people saying that, share that is it not true.Inside Campbell Hall, a dorm prized for its proximity to the Union, Lila had been taking cover for two hours after fleeing the shooting. Police entered the building around 10:30 p.m. and told students to line up against the walls. They patted everyone down before moving on.Around that time, a video circulated on social media showing a man who appeared to match the shooter’s description about half a mile down the road, walking past a fraternity house. The footage quickly circulated through campus group chats.In most mass killings, there is just one gunman, but the mix of video and scattered reports of near-simultaneous shooting fueled fears of a second or a third.It wasn’t until just after 11 p.m., when campus police held their first press briefing, that officials said explicitly that they believed there was only a single shooter.Police cars outside the Union on Monday. (Nick King/AP)At the news conference, MSU Police Interim Deputy Chief Chris Rozman warned students and staff that there was much “misinformation” swirling around social media and appearing on the police scanner, as first responders tried to sort through an avalanche of incoming information.“There has been false reports, false reports of additional shootings,” Rozman said. “There has been false reports of the suspect seen in numerous different locations.”Just after he spoke, police released photos of the suspect, apparently taken from campus surveillance video.As friends continued checking in, some three hours into the campus lockdown, they received another alert from the school, repeating that someone was “actively shooting” on campus.A person is actively shooting at the East Lansing campus. This is an active and ongoing situation. Follow the Run, Hide and Fight guidelines. Secure in place; turn cell phones to silent; remain quite. Suspect description: short male with mask, possibly black male.At that time, however, the shooter was probably miles away. About 20 minutes later, just before midnight, the 911 dispatcher advised that police had “found a subject who matched the description” near an intersection north of downtown Lansing, well over an hour walk from campus.“When they made an approach, he shot himself,” the dispatcher said.Back in Williams Hall, Cibor and her three friends were still crouched on the ground, trying to stay hidden.At 12:26 a.m., police began their second news briefing. The shooter was found off campus, Rozman said, and he was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. At last, officials lifted the shelter-in-place order.As Rozman spoke, police sent two updates, one by email and another by Twitter. The email alert, automatically sent to the campus community, said someone “matching the suspect description has been located” and that “there is no longer believed to be an imminent threat to campus.”At or near City of East Lansing the Michigan State University Police report; An individual matching the suspect description has been located. There is no longer believed to be an imminent threat to campus. The shelter-in-place order is lifted. Contact Michigan State University Police to report any unusual or suspicious activity.It did not say the gunman was dead.A police tweet sent about the same time was more clear, but some students said they had only seen the email, and they were still on edge. Was it really safe? Was there another shooter at large?Slowly, uneasily, the campus unwound. Lights came back on, friends reunited — hugging, sobbing. Most couldn’t sleep, their adrenaline still pumping, still working to find out whether their friends were among the victims.Outside Duffield’s room, police lights flashed in her windows all night. In Cibor’s dorm, her group spent hours debriefing until there was nothing more to say. They fell silent, staring at the floor. Lila, a witness, spoke with police until 2 a.m. And in Cedar Village, just off campus, Falzetta met up with the friends he’d been texting all night. They embraced and ate dinner but couldn’t shake the feeling of danger.They turned out the lights and slid a chair back up against the door.Audio clips from Broadcastify.

  "text": "Police said Thursday that they were sorting out why gunfire erupted between several people at the conclusion of Wednesday’s rally for the Chiefs, leaving one Johnson County mother of two dead and more than 20 with gunshot wounds, at least half of them under age 16. Two juveniles were in police custody Thursday as the investigation continued, police said.\n\nThe city’s mayor, Quinton Lucas (D), said in interviews that while a St. Patrick’s Day parade next month would continue as scheduled, the city may have to contemplate holding a much smaller rally at Arrowhead Stadium if the Chiefs win another Super Bowl so fans can be sent through metal detectors beforehand.\n\nWith parades planned for St. Patrick’s Day next month, “my city and many American cities will be tested,” Lucas said. “Is this just something we live with in the same way that we’re living with school shootings and the threat to movie theaters and the threat to bowling alleys?”\n\nLucas said he had spoken Thursday morning with Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) about a 2022 shooting — allegedly by a 21-year-old man armed with an semiautomatic rifle — that left seven people dead and several dozen wounded at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park. Lucas said he told Pritzker that “I shouldn’t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.”\n\nThe tragedy seemed to hit especially hard in Kansas City, a smaller market which has always had an outsize love for its National Football League team — even in the lean years between Super Bowl appearances and before the white-hot attention drawn by tight end Travis Kelce’s romance with musician Taylor Swift. Local reporters covering the shooting Wednesday wept during their standups, and morning radio shows Thursday turned into therapy sessions for heartbroken fans.\n\n“This isn’t Kansas City,” grieving residents said over and over, echoing the words Wednesday of the city’s police chief. But, in a way, it is — the city has long suffered from gang violence and hit a record number of homicides last year at 184. Just last month, a shooting between parties at a food court in the mall just steps from the rally grounds left six injured.\n\nIn the chaos following Wednesday’s violence, panicked fans scaled barricades and took refuge in the city’s iconic Union Station, where the public officials and Chiefs players and coaches had been rushed for their safety. The famous and their fans huddled, barricaded in rooms and trying to comfort children separated from their parents.\n\n“This is SAD man! Kids are being shot and somebody didn’t come home tonight,” Chiefs safety Justin Reid wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We cannot allow this to be normal. We cannot [allow] ourselves to become numb and chalk it up to ‘just another shooting in America’ and reduce people in statistics and then move on tmrw.\n\nAfterward, Abarca, 35, texted the county’s general counsel and said he wanted the attorney to draft language on gun control measures within days, no matter that by state law, localities may not be able to enact such changes. “We cannot just sit here and do nothing,” he said.\n\nThe Chiefs’ parades — which wind through downtown Kansas City and end up with a rally at Union Station — are rowdy affairs, with the players jumping off the buses to mingle with the fans on the sidelines, signing autographs and high-fiving. Footballs arc through the air, and plenty of alcohol is consumed by players and spectators.\n\nIn that climate, he said, tensions between people can quickly erupt into violence. “When you have actors who don’t have any regard for the safety of other individuals and they’re just thinking of their own beef, then these things can happen,” he said.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nFrom jubilation to chaos, here’s how the Kansas City shooting unfoldedThe shooting broke out as thousands of fans gathered to celebrate Kansas City’s Super Bowl victory on Feb. 14. (Video: The Washington Post)Kansas City, Mo., had pulled off this celebration before. Thousands of people wearing Chiefs jerseys lined the streets and showered their hometown team with feverish fanfare in celebration of another Super Bowl win as red, white and yellow confetti fell around them. They’d jumped up and down, cheering loudly with their hands in the air to give the Kansas City Chiefs another memorable homecoming — the team’s third in the last five years.The “Chiefs Kingdom” watched excitedly as players made their way through the two-mile-long route in downtown, ending at Union Station, where they gave rousing speeches to a red-clad crowd. It was a day for Kansas City to celebrate back-to-back Super Bowl wins — a feat that hadn’t been achieved in nearly two decades.But at the rally’s end that afternoon, Kansas City fans heard the same sound that has transformed other American celebrations into nightmares: gunshots.After the Chiefs’ championship win, Kansas City officials knew fans would come out in droves to celebrate.Authorities posted information online about reunification sites ahead of the parade as they planned for the possibility of people losing track of each other in a crowd that they expected would be bigger than last year’s.Officials began closing down roads on Tuesday. By the next morning, hundreds of police officers were stationed along the route and around Union Station.Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce sang to the crowd at the team’s Super Bowl parade. (Video: AP)Around 11 a.m., Chiefs’ players started their journey toward Union Station, where they would address Kansas City faithfuls at a victory rally. The team rode atop red double-decker buses with “world champions” emblazoned in bold white font, driving slowly by hundreds of thousands of fans who had waited all morning to see them.It was “Party time again!” as the Kansas City Star had put it on that morning’s front page headline. That energy was palpable in every sign that was held, every flag that was waved, every cheer that was shouted. All morning, the city sang, danced and welcomed back its team.Near the end of the parade, fans crowded around Union Station to hear from the victors in the parade’s finale.“Chiefs Kingdom, y’all are the reason that we do what we do,” quarterback Patrick Mahomes told the crowd.Kansas City fans had gathered close together, forming a sea of red as they listened to the speeches.But, soon, they would splinter in every direction.‘It seems like almost nothing is safe.’At first, some thought the noise that erupted around 2 p.m. was fireworks.But the volley of gunfire continued, sending paradegoers sprinting away from the sound of gunfire. Some dropped to the ground, trying to take cover behind railings or cardboard boxes. Within moments, a day that had started with sheer joy spiraled into a shocking tragedy.“It seems like almost nothing is safe,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas (D) said.Around 2 p.m. Central time on Feb. 14, shots rang out while terrified fans fled the area. (Video: Anonymous via Storyful)Police who were already staged around the parade rushed to the scene. Fans continued to flee, crushing regalia and confetti strewn on the concrete in their wake.Police officers are seen running toward the scene of the shooting at Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., on Feb. 14. (Video: AP)During the chaos, someone in the crowd yelled “Get him!”A group of fans nearby ran and tackled one of the three people who was later detained by police, Trey Filter, one of the bystanders, recalled.Fans tackled an alleged shooter as he was running through the crowd on Feb. 14. (Video: Christopher A & Alyssa Marsh-Contreras via Storyful)Police on Thursday said the shooting stemmed from a personal dispute among several people. One person was killed and at least 22 others were injured in the incident, officials said. Of those injured, half were under 16 years old.Lucas, the Kansas City mayor, was one of several politicians in attendance. He later described how he, along with his wife and mother, had to run for safety as they heard the gunshots erupt.“This is a day that a lot of people look forward to, something they remember for a lifetime,” Lucas said. “And what they shouldn’t have to remember is the threat of gun violence marring a day like this.”Police reported shots fired, saying “multiple people were struck” at Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., following speeches by the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 14. (Video: AP)‘She was so full of life’On Wednesday, local radio station KKFI 90.1 FM confirmed that Elizabeth “Lisa” Lopez-Galvan, one of its hosts, died in the shooting. Lopez-Galvan, who was also a DJ for special occasions in the community and “did everybody’s wedding,” had been known for her contagious smile and laugh.“She was so full of life,” Lisa Lopez, a longtime friend of Lopez-Galvan, told the Kansas City Star.Tommy Andrade said Lopez-Galvan, his friend and co-host, “treated everyone she knew and loved as close family.”Lopez-Galvan had gone to the parade with her adult son, who was shot in the leg, according to KKFI. Her family has been heartbroken, they said in a statement, calling her an “amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.”As of Thursday evening, authorities had yet to file any charges or identify what firearms they had recovered from the scene.As they continue to investigate, questions surrounding the incident have left Kansas City residents wondering how their home became the latest in a long list of places turned upside down by gun violence.First responders arrive after a shooting in Kansas City, Mo., on Feb. 14. (Video: The Washington Post)Chiefs fans and players asked those same questions as they took to social media after the parade.“When are we going to fix these gun laws?” Chiefs defensive end Charles Omenihu wrote in one post.Wednesday’s shooting marked the most recent example of gun violence in the United States, which many regard as an aspect that has become an all-too-common part of living in America. It had scarred what was supposed to be a day of celebration in Kansas City, the way it had at schools, rallies and movie theaters across the country, Lucas said.“I wish we lived in a world where we wouldn’t have to see incidents like that,” he said.But by day’s end, it was much quieter, with crinkled confetti and crushed cans on the ground, surrounded by yellow police tape.",

  "text": "The deadly shooting that turned a celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs into a tragedy on Wednesday appeared to stem from a dispute among several people and had “no nexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism,” officials said Thursday morning. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a briefing that two of three people detained are juveniles. None has been charged yet, and additional detentions or arrests are possible, she said.\n\nThe shooting occurred about 2 p.m. amid a crowd of fans outside the city’s Union Station as the parade and rally for the Super Bowl champions drew to a close. At the sound of gunfire, people fled in every direction while police and first responders began swarming the scene. The three people were taken into custody a short time later.\n\nOne woman was killed and 22 people were injured in a matter of minutes. The victims’ ages range from 8 to 47, Graves said, and at least half are younger than 16.\n\n“This incident is still a very active investigation,” she noted. Authorities must charge the people in custody within 24 hours or release them, she said, adding that “we have all intentions of presenting charges.”\n\nA statement from the University Health hospital in Kansas City said three gunshot victims remained there Thursday, including two in critical condition. Saint Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City was continuing to treat one victim, who was still listed as in critical condition Thursday. Children’s Mercy had received a dozen victims, nine with gunshot wounds, in the aftermath of the rally. All are expected to recover, according to a hospital spokesperson.\n\nThe city continued to clean up the scene, which was still littered Thursday morning after with fans’ folding chairs, Chiefs regalia, and red and yellow confetti. The Jackson County prosecutor’s office was offering counseling services for members of the public feeling traumatized by what they had witnessed.\n\n“We are seeing more things with a lot of people getting hit, even unintentionally. I’m not going to get ahead of the facts here, but it is something that I think is a very real concern,” he said.\n\n“I’d be lying to you if I didn’t say that we’ll probably evaluate in the event that we’re blessed to have another Super Bowl championship,” Lucas said in an interview Thursday morning, wondering whether future gatherings would need to be held at a stadium or other location where attendees would be wanded at security checkpoints.\n\nThe shooting was the latest to upend a community’s celebration with deadly violence. And with parades coming up on St. Patrick’s Day next month, “my city and many American cities will be tested,” Lucas said. “Is this just something we live with in the same way that we’re living with school shootings and the threat to movie theaters and the threat to bowling alleys?”\n\nLucas said he had spoken Thursday morning with Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) about a 2022 shooting — allegedly by a 21-year-old man armed with an semiautomatic rifle — that left seven people dead and several dozen wounded at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill. Lucas said he told Pritzker that “I shouldn’t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.”\n\nOne security expert, Michael Chertoff, former secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security, also raised the issue of ensuring safety with such open events. In a stadium, he noted, “you can screen people for bringing in weapons or things that are dangerous, potential bombs. And you also can funnel them in through a portal that gives you control over everybody who comes in. Obviously, when you’re dealing with the street, you don’t have that capability.”\n\nOfficials declined Thursday to comment on the kinds of weapons used in the parade shooting. Missouri, which has some of the nation’s laxest gun laws, has no age minimum for possession of a firearm, though federal law prohibits minors from possessing handguns except in rare circumstances. A bill that Missouri legislators passed three years ago declared federal gun laws invalid and prohibited state and local authorities from enforcing them, but that law is tied up in court.\n\nThe Kansas City Council last August passed two ordinances to strengthen gun laws in the city. One measure banned specific weapons, including machine guns, firearm silencers and components, such as bump stocks, that turn semiautomatic guns into fully automatic weapons. The other prohibited the transfer of weapons, including ammunition, to minors. The mayor said at the time that he believed the ordinances complied with state law.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nMay 25, 2023 at 8:11 a.m. EDTJames Wood has all five tools  — power, contact ability, speed, a strong arm and glove. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) At some point in their retelling, the memories start to sound like myths. There was a travel baseball game in Frederick. The kid in the batter’s box, no older than 10, crushed a homer that soared way past the fence and into the top of a tree. The kid’s coach recalled the fence was 200 feet from home plate and the trees were 30 feet farther.Then there was a showcase in Marietta, Ga. The kid was older, 17, and flicked a shoulder-high fastball for an opposite-field triple to left. When he got out of the batter’s box, he started gathering speed as if a strong wind was blowing in the same direction as his legs, following him to each bag. The teenager’s coach looked into the crowd and saw dozens of scouts and college recruiters taking notes.And then there was an afternoon workout last summer in Fredericksburg. The teenager was James Wood, now the Washington Nationals’ top prospect, the player the San Diego Padres didn’t want to trade for Juan Soto but had to in the end. Over and over, he glided through the gaps and caught balls intended for teammates. De Jon Watson, the Nationals’ director of player development, pulled Wood aside, asking him to let the right and left fielders get some work, too.… in a minor league game in April, Wood dug to first, then second, then touched the inside corner of the base and headed to third. He was not flying in the literal sense. He’s neither a bird nor make-believe. But at 6-foot-6, Wood challenges how speed can look — and what a baseball star can look like — one space-swallowing stride at a time.“Three! Three! Three!” his dad, Kenny, yelled once Wood crushed a 114-mph liner into the right field corner. And when Wood slid in safely, when he screamed toward his dugout, when gravity had rooted his cleats to the dirt, Paula, his mom, only whispered, “Now that’s my boy.”Their son is still 20, still shy, still relatively new to being the center of attention wherever he goes. On Sunday, he was promoted from high Class A Wilmington to Class AA Harrisburg, a decision that came after he posted five triples, eight homers and a .972 OPS for the Blue Rocks (including a 1.342 OPS in their notoriously pitcher-friendly park). The Olney, Md., native then singled on the first pitch he saw in Class AA. He has all five tools — power, contact ability, speed, a strong arm and a glove — leading Baseball Prospectus to rank him as MLB’s third-best prospect entering this season.Watching him now, listening to the coaches he has played for, it would seem as if everyone had agreed on Wood’s promise from the moment he held a bat. Think again. In baseball, 6-6 position players typically move to the mound because of the assumption they will struggle at the highest levels. And before the Padres drafted Wood in the second round in 2021, evaluators questioned whether his long arms would keep him from reaching tough fastballs, whether he could stick in the outfield, whether he cared enough. To them, Wood’s extra-long strides often made it look as though he were jogging instead of sprinting. Teams called his travel and high school coaches and poked any hole they could. One time, Kenny sat with an agent who kept begging pro scouts to read their stopwatches before scribbling notes about Wood.Surgery removed this Nats prospect’s rib. It might also give him a career.Their biases, their knee-jerk instinct to write off a player they couldn’t fit in a box, told them Wood was dogging it. The numbers showed blazing speed.“You look at the big leagues, and there’s not a lot of guys to compare him to, so it’s hard,” said Andy Partin, who coached Wood the summer between his junior and senior years at IMG Academy. “He’s not shaped like Mike Trout. He’s not shaped like Barry Bonds. But he is shaped like James Wood, and that works for him. I mean, boy, does it work for him.”… at the start of Wood’s junior year of high school, James and Kenny watched batting practice at Yankee Stadium, waiting to glimpse Aaron Judge or Giancarlo Stanton. Wood was maybe 6-5 then, both a baseball and basketball player at St. John’s College High. He wore a Mississippi State baseball shirt because he had committed to the program, not yet knowing he would shoot up MLB draft boards.Manny Upton, father of major leaguers B.J. and Justin Upton, had coached Wood and thought it would be good for him to see super tall players in person. And because Justin’s Angels were playing the Yankees, Manny got Wood and Kenny on the field, where Marcus Thames, New York’s hitting coach and a Mississippi native, noticed Wood’s shirt and told Judge to walk over.People are counting on Dave Martinez. He knows it.“Hi, I’m Aaron,” Wood remembered Judge saying, hand extended, as if Wood didn’t know his favorite player’s name. Judge asked whether he played basketball or football. Wood quietly told him no, he was ready to focus solely on becoming a professional outfielder. So Judge waved him past the ropes and spoke with him for 10 minutes, letting him stand on major league grass for the first time.Judge is a 6-7 outfielder and broke the American League’s single-season home run record in 2022. Stanton, Judge’s teammate, is 6-6 like Wood. Throughout baseball history, there are many pitchers who stood that tall and way, way fewer position players. Listing the successful ones, the ones a team could build around, takes no more than two hands. Frank Howard, once a feared slugger for the Washington Senators, was a 6-7 outfielder who split his time at first base as he got older.Tony Clark, president of the MLB Players Association, was a 6-8 first baseman. Dave Winfield and Dave Kingman are 6-6. And after that, size returns to what the sport considers ordinary.“There’s a lot more uncertainty than picking like a 6-foot-1, left-handed-hitting shortstop,” Wood said of why teams might shy away from tall position players, adding that he closely watches Oneil Cruz, a 6-7 shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates. “You could compare a guy like that to Corey Seager. … Being unconventional, there’s obviously just going to be a lot more doubt on whether it will really work or not.”Is he usually drawn to players who look like him?“I don’t have a bias,” he said with a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “If they’re good, I’ll watch them.”On the long and winding path to the majors, tall players face scrutiny about their ability to stay healthy, hit low pitches and fill any position but first base or designated hitter. It feels easier, then, to convert them to pitchers or nudge them toward the basketball court. Wood has basketball in his blood and stuck with it for a while. His dad once starred at the University of Richmond. His oldest sister, Kayla, was a manager for the women’s team at Notre Dame, and Sydney, the middle child, just finished playing at Northwestern.But when Wood had a ball in his hands, he felt pressure he couldn’t shake. (And if he’s being totally honest, he didn’t like covering sweaty big men.) The pressure bit confused Paula when Wood drifted toward a sport that would turn his enviable size into a question mark.“Baseball doesn’t feel that way?” she recalled asking him, probing at how he would feel with two strikes in the last inning, with everything on the line.“That doesn’t feel like pressure,” Wood told her, and they left it at that.“I wish people knew what a smart baseball player he is,” Paula said this spring. “If you ask him about any at-bat, he can tell you what he was thinking, what he did right, what he did wrong. I think one of the ways he handles all the pressure and attention is focusing on his craft.”… a day after hitting that triple in April, Wood sat atop the bench, his right foot resting on the dugout floor. His first season at IMG, a premier sports academy in Bradenton, Fla., was upended by the coronavirus pandemic. But because IMG restarted before any college or pro teams, area pro scouts swarmed its games and practices.As a senior, Wood fell into a short slump that may have lowered his draft stock. Sure, he faced some top pitchers — and the umpiring wasn’t flawless — yet every strikeout made Wood want to disappear. He hated walking off the field as all the scouts tapped their phones and iPads. He even raised his pants to around his knees, hoping the high socks would show umps where his zone should start.“I felt like I was on an island, like everyone was watching me and I couldn’t hide,” Wood said. “I wasn’t really sure where to go from there.”So where did he go?“A lot of time in the cage,” he said with a laugh, bumping his head on the dugout’s concrete ceiling. Then he rubbed it a little. Then he considered what he ultimately wants from baseball, squinting his eyes as if his whole future was out there in the distance.“I just want to be able to walk away on my own terms” is what he landed on. “Have a career where I say I did all I could, I left it all out there, I don’t have any big regrets.”Even if the sport wasn’t built for an outfielder his size, the Nationals’ rebuild should have plenty of room. At the end of Wood’s first professional season in 2021, he had essentially cut his strikeout rate in half, an almost impossible feat for a player who bypassed college. All spring, members of the Nationals’ front office have raved about his plate discipline and feel for the strike zone. And if it didn’t feel so reductive to connect Wood to the star he was traded for, here is where you would point out the similarities to a young Juan Soto, who debuted for Washington at 19 and never looked back.That afternoon in Wilmington, Wood crushed four straight batting practice homers to a parking lot well beyond the right field fence.

  "text": "The violence forced emergency evacuations of the region’s top political leaders gathered for the parade and rally, including the governors of Missouri and Kansas and the mayor of Kansas City, who fled the shots with his wife and mother.\n\nThe incident reverberated around a country still shaken by several recent episodes of high-profile gun violence: In Houston, a woman burst into a megachurch between Sunday services and opened fire; in D. C., three police officers were shot while serving a warrant Wednesday; and just hours later, four students were wounded in a drive-by shooting outside of an Atlanta high school.\n\n“It’s absurd that we cannot celebrate our city’s victory without fearing for our lives at the same time,” Tara Bennett, a volunteer with the Kansas City chapter of Moms Demand Action who was at the parade, said in a statement.\n\nMissouri has among the nation’s highest rates of gun deaths and firearm ownership, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-safety advocacy group. The state also has some of the weakest gun-control laws in the country and its Republican leadership — who control both chambers of the legislature and the governorship — have shown little interest in passing further restrictions.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, Kansas City police had taken three people into custody and recovered multiple firearms, but they had not identified the suspects or the weapons, nor had they named any of the victims. Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a radio DJ and host of “Taste of Tejano” on Kansas City radio station KKFI, was killed in the shooting, according to Tommy Andrade, a family friend and co-host of the show. Andrade said Lopez-Galvan’s husband, Mike, informed him of her death. The station put out a statement calling her death a “senseless act.”\n\nGraves and other city leaders praised the parade’s security measures and the police response, saying the hundreds of officers already on the scene acted fast and prevented further bloodshed. The shooting occurred, despite the heavy police presence, because of “bad actors,” Graves said.\n\nWednesday’s festivities marked Kansas City’s third Super Bowl victory in five years, and the day’s party started off just like the others. Fans arrived early on an unseasonably warm Midwest day. They lined the streets, draped in Chiefs gear, holding signs and waving team flags as they jockeyed for position, trying to catch a glimpse of the players as they bounded past.\n\nLocal hero and star quarterback Patrick Mahomes swaggered down the parade route, slapping hands with fans and unzipping his jacket to show off a bare chest. Travis Kelce, the team’s all-pro tight end and boyfriend to Taylor Swift, dropped to one knee and chugged a beer as the crowd around him roared.\n\nPolice responded to the first shots shortly after the team’s players and coaches delivered remarks at the rally outside the train station. Videos posted on social media showed spectators rushing from the area as police ran inside the historic building. Other videos showed responders aiding victims on the ground outside.\n\nKansas City interim fire chief Ross Grundyson told reporters that of the 21 injured victims, eight had “immediately life-threatening” injuries and seven had “life-threatening injuries.” Six others were considered to have “minor” injuries. A spokesperson for Kansas City’s Children’s Mercy hospital confirmed to The Washington Post that the facility was treating 12 patients from the shooting, 11 of whom were children.\n\n“For this joy to be turned to tragedy today in Kansas City cuts deep in the American soul,” he said. “Today’s events should move us, shock us, shame us into acting. What are we waiting for? What else do we need to see? How many more families need to be torn apart?”\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson (R), who attended the parade with his wife, said it was a “tragic conclusion to a celebration we had all looked forward to.” And Gov. Laura Kelly (D) of Kansas said she was evacuated and that the “senseless act of violence goes against everything Kansas City and the Chiefs Kingdom stand for.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nCaps are left with a ‘sour feeling’ after OT loss ends winning streakCapitals defenseman Nick Jensen and goaltender Charlie Lindgren deny the Panthers' Nick Cousins and Evan Rodrigues during the third period Saturday night in Sunrise, Fla. (Wilfredo Lee/AP)SUNRISE, Fla. — As the Florida Panthers streamed onto the ice, Dylan Strome could barely lift his head. The Washington Capitals center was the last man back at the end of a long shift in overtime after winger Sonny Milano turned the puck over and the Panthers came flying down the ice. Strome dropped to a knee to try to block Sam Bennett’s pass to Gustav Forsling, but he couldn’t break up the play, and Forsling placed a shot between goaltender Charlie Lindgren and the post for the winner.Strome remained on the ice for several moments as Amerant Bank Arena erupted after Florida handed the Capitals a 3-2 loss that ended their three-game winning streak Saturday night.A month ago, when Washington (26-21-9) was scuffling through a dismal road trip and saw its playoff hopes slipping further and further away, picking up a point against the Eastern Conference’s second-place team would have felt like a win. But after the Capitals hung with the Panthers (38-16-4) in a tightly contested matchup — and gave themselves a chance to grab two points — coming away with one was tough to take.“We played fine. We played good. We competed,” winger Tom Wilson said. “Guys worked hard. It wasn’t lack of effort. It was just a couple things that they capitalize on. Bit of a sour feeling, for sure, just because they’re meaningful points and we’re right in the fight. It was a tough match. We left it all out there.”Nick Cousins put Florida ahead at 4:03 of the second period with a fluky deflection. Standing in the slot, he batted a point shot by Dmitry Kulikov out of the air; the puck bounced off the ice in front of the crease before sailing over Lindgren’s pad.Cousins, who earned the ignominious honor of being named the player whose face other NHL players most want to punch in the Athletic’s anonymous player poll last month, hit winger Max Pacioretty into Washington’s bench midway through the period, and that prompted a physical response from winger Anthony Mantha. Mantha was whistled for a hooking penalty on Cousins 14 seconds after the hit, and the two dropped the gloves. Mantha clearly got the better of the battle.The Capitals killed Mantha’s hooking penalty, and while he was serving his fighting major, they seemed to find a spark. It still took until the end of the period for Washington to find the net, but a series of strong shifts put more pressure on the Panthers and helped build momentum.“I thought we started off well. Sometimes you’ve got to wake up a little bit there in the second period,” Pacioretty said. “I thought we started to play physical. Both sides did — brought both teams into the fight. We found our game again, and we played some good hockey.”Wilson drew a hooking penalty with 3:09 remaining in the period, and after two unimpressive power plays in the first period, the Capitals cashed in on their third chance. From the right faceoff circle, Pacioretty slid a tape-to-tape pass across the zone to defenseman Rasmus Sandin, who seamlessly fired the puck back across the crease to Milano, who was waiting on the back post for a slam-dunk finish at 18:31.Washington hasn’t executed many tic-tac-toe passing plays, particularly on the power play, but this sequence was as crisp as the power play has looked all season.The Capitals were at risk of losing their momentum when defenseman John Carlson was boxed for slashing just 12 seconds into the third period, giving the NHL’s fourth-ranked power play a chance to grab the lead. But Washington killed the penalty with relative ease, allowing Florida just one shot on goal. And on the Capitals’ next power-play opportunity, Wilson ended a 14-game goalless drought with a power move to the net that beat Anthony Stolarz (22 saves) and gave Washington its first lead at 10:11.For much of the game, the Capitals avoided letting the Panthers get their forecheck going with a combination of puck control in the offensive zone and smart, efficient exits from the defensive end. But with under five minutes to play, Florida impressed during a lengthy shift that ended with two highlight-reel stops by Lindgren (26 saves) and a hooking penalty for defenseman Nick Jensen.Last time out: Capitals keep their composure, beat Lightning for third straight win“We did such a good job up to that point of exactly what we’d talked about — those pucks that go in the corner and you’re going to get pressure and you have to find an out,” Washington Coach Spencer Carbery said. “… We just mismanaged a couple of those, and then that’s what leads to sustained pressure.”Off the faceoff that began the power play, Bennett found space in the slot for an open look, but his wrister rang off the post — fooling large swaths of the crowd who celebrated as if he had tied the score. The Panthers’ fans didn’t have to wait long to celebrate for real: Carter Verhaeghe’s wrist shot from the top of the left circle was deflected by Aleksander Barkov past Lindgren just 43 seconds later. The Capitals hung on in the final minutes to force overtime, but the single point proved to be all they could muster.“I think since we came back from the [all-star] break, we’ve been playing good enough hockey to win,” Wilson said. “That being said, we’ve got to get results. Next game is the biggest game of the year, and the game after that is the biggest game of the year. Got to keep pushing this thing. Just banding together, grinding forward and see what we can do.”Note: Mantha didn’t play the last 5:45 of regulation or in overtime after leaving with an injury. No details on the nature of his issue were shared, but Carbery confirmed Mantha was hurt.Caps are left with a ‘sour feeling’ after OT loss ends winning streakCaps are left with a ‘sour feeling’ after OT loss ends winning streakCapitals keep their composure, beat Lightning for third straight winCapitals keep their composure, beat Lightning for third straight winCaps cruise behind two-goal nights by Connor McMichael and Alex OvechkinCaps cruise behind two-goal nights by Connor McMichael and Alex OvechkinThe Wizards keep experimenting, even as the losses pile upJosiah Gray tinkers with his game often.

  "text": "It was just like any other Tuesday night. Elizabeth “Lisa” Lopez-Galvan was on air for her weekly radio show, “A Taste of Tejano,” sharing her love of music. The program features Tejano music, a “Tex-Mex” fusion of Mexican and American musical influences.“Let us know if you have a birthday, anniversary or special announcement!” Lopez-Galvan wrote on Facebook before her show, as she often did.\n\nOnce the show was over, she and her co-host, Tommy Andrade, parted ways — not knowing that it would be their last time together.\n\nPolice said one person was killed and 22 were injured but have not named any of the victims. Their ages range from 8 to 47 years old.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among “several” people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two, volunteered on the show before joining as a full-time programmer and co-host about two years ago, said Andrade, her co-host and family friend, remembering her as a kind person with an infectious smile. “She treated everyone she knew and loved as close family,” he told The Washington Post. “She will be missed.”\n\nAccording to Lopez-Galvan’s radio station, her adult son was shot in the leg at the rally but had been released from the hospital.\n\nIn a statement, the Lopez-Galvan family said: “We thank the community for their prayers and support during this difficult time. We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one … who was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.”\n\n“We ask to please keep our family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of Lisa’s death while also supporting our other loved ones who were impacted in this senseless act,” the statement said.\n\nAbarca choked up as he recalled his conversation Wednesday with one of Lopez-Galvan’s cousins. Both broke down in tears. Then the cousin told him: “What you need to do is do your job and change this.”\n\nThroughout her life, serving others was a key part of Lopez-Galvan’s life — from assisting people who didn’t speak English as a court clerk, to helping people in her community find jobs, according to a 2021 profile in the local newspaper Dos Mundos. She was bilingual in English and Spanish, her profile on KKFI said.\n\nIn an interview with Kansas City Hispanic News late last year, Lopez-Galvan credited her father, who played in local Mexican bands after arriving in Kansas City in his youth, for her love of music.\n\n“I just want to thank him, because if it wasn’t for him and the music I listened to growing up, I wouldn’t have this passion for music,” she said.\n\nThe last Facebook post she wrote before her final show — where she asked for birthdays, anniversaries or other special occasions — has now become a place for people to mourn a woman they never knew.\n\nBut for those who listened or knew her, it’s also a place to remember a kind individual who “always wanted to help others,” as one person wrote.",

  "text": "Donald Trump is the overwhelming polling leader for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, even as he faces four criminal indictments. But several GOP rivals are holding out hope for an upset through strong showings in the first states set to vote.\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Biden is seeking reelection and heavily favored to win, despite two lesser-known challengers. Independent or third-party candidates such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., are longshots but could sway a close general election matchup.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses kicked off the presidential nominating process on Jan. 15.\n\nRepublicans have rallied to the former president’s side as he faces growing legal peril – accused in court of falsifying business records, mishandling classified documents and unsuccessfully attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Some trials are scheduled to play out as GOP voters are still selecting their nominee -- though the proceedings could be delayed. Trump has used the criminal investigations to his political benefit in the primary, vowing “retribution” for his enemies and resurging from a moment of vulnerability after the 2022 midterms.\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who later served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, seized new attention this fall with her debate performances, and many Republicans now view her as the most viable alternative to Trump. She’s surged toward Trump in New Hampshire, where she’s running on a traditional Republican platform but has also enticed moderates and independents as she calls for a new, younger generation of leaders. But to many in the GOP she embodies an older incarnation of the party that Trump shattered.\n\nFormer Texas congressman Will Hurd ended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in October and endorsed Haley. He launched his campaign declaring that if Republicans nominate “a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump... we all know Joe Biden will win again.” The ex-CIA officer was known in Congress for his willingness to work with Democrats and is now making a longshot pitch for his more moderate brand of what he calls “common-sense leadership.\"\n\nMike Pence ended his campaign in October after struggling to gain traction among Republican voters – many of whom faulted him for defying Trump’s pressure to reject the results of the 2020 election. Pence served as vice president under Trump and embraced his agenda but broke with him on Jan. 6, 2021, refusing to interfere with the certification of Biden’s electoral win. He grew more critical of Trump during his presidential bid, suggesting his former running mate is unfit for office. But he still indicated he would back Trump if he wins the GOP nomination.\n\nBiden is seeking reelection, saying he wants to “finish the job” he started when the country was besieged by a deadly pandemic, a reeling economy and a teetering democracy. Polling shows that many Democrats would prefer a nominee other than Biden in 2024, and at 80 he is the oldest president in U. S. history to seek a second term. But major Democratic leaders have not taken steps to challenge him, and his party’s better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterms helped quiet critics.\n\n[How Democrats across the country feel about Biden 2024]\n\nRep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) announced a long-shot primary challenge to President Biden in 2024. While Phillips’s political views are broadly aligned with those of Biden, Phillips has for months called on Biden to allow another Democrat to lead the Democratic ticket in 2024. “I’m representing what I believe to be the majority of the country that wants to turn the page,” Phillips said recently on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Tired of the meanness and the fearmongering of Donald Trump. I would like to see Joe Biden, a wonderful and remarkable man, pass the torch, cement this extraordinary legacy.”\n\nActivist and self-help author Marianne Williamson is waging a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination. Williamson is positioning herself to Biden’s left, advocating tuition-free higher education at public institutions, among other initiatives. She also ran for president in 2020, calling for “a moral and spiritual awakening” in the United States, and dropped out shortly before the first nominating contests. “We need to offer fundamental economic reform. Nothing short of that will beat the Republicans in 2024,” she told The Post in an interview.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a controversial member of the storied Kennedy family who is known for his anti-vaccine views, parlayed his famous last name into years of advocacy as an environmental lawyer and best-selling author. In recent years, however, he has become better-known as one of the country’s most prominent opponents of vaccines and peddled false claims linking them to autism. He gained even more notoriety during the pandemic while spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines.\n\nAzi Paybarah, Michael Scherer, Tyler Pager, Maeve Reston, Toluse Olorunnipa, Mariana Alfaro, Meryl Kornfield, Maegan Vazquez and John Wagner contributed to this report.

  "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — With a flick of the wrist in the fifth inning, James Wood sent the first pitch he saw Saturday night into orbit. It carried. It carried some more. It seemed the ball would never land, but it finally descended into the outfield grass beyond the right field fence. Fans converged, trying to grab the missile that landed at their feet.\n\nThe Nationals lost, 7-4, to the Houston Astros at Park of the Palm Beaches in their spring training opener, but the final score was far from the story. This game was all about prospects getting their first shot to show what they can do.\n\nAfter the 21-year-old slugger’s majestic home run, fellow outfielder Robert Hassell III, 22, followed with a line drive that turned into a triple; he scored in the ensuing at-bat. By the sixth inning, soon-to-be-22-year-old Dylan Crews replaced Victor Robles in center field. He made a sliding catch in the seventh to rob the Astros of a hit.\n\nBefore the top prospects entered, Patrick Corbin threw 50 pitches over 1⅔ innings and allowed two runs. He had four strikeouts, all of them with his new cutter. Then the youngsters got their chance. Jackson Rutledge, 24, tossed two scoreless innings on an efficient 31 pitches. Then came the three outfielders, who all provided a glimpse of what is hopefully to come.\n\n“This is going to be a fun spring training,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “One, we got to get our guys ready and, two, we’re going to see a lot of these young kids. ... It keeps me busy, but it’s a lot of fun. It’s a good busy.”\n\nReliever Dylan Floro is dealing with shoulder tightness but is still throwing every day. The 33-year old right-hander, who signed in December, didn’t recover well from his latest bullpen session. Floro said he has dealt with this feeling during past spring trainings, so he isn’t alarmed but wants to be cautious. He doesn’t believe he will need that many innings to get himself ready for Opening Day.\n\nGeneral Manager Mike Rizzo opened camp by saying it was unlikely the Nationals would pursue any more major league contracts. But he did leave the door open for minor league deals to give the team depth in case of injuries. Since camp opened, the Nationals agreed to deals with reliever Jacob Barnes, starter Zach Davies and, most recently, reliever Derek Law.\n\nBarnes, 33, is an eight-year veteran who has played for eight teams since 2019. Davies, 31, has made 200 career starts. Law, 33, had one of the best years of his career last season with Cincinnati, finishing with a 3.60 ERA in 55 innings before he was non-tendered in November. Law was holding out hope for a major league deal and was surprised he didn’t get one.\n\n“Yeah, a little bit,” he said. “But you could tell the way free agency was going at the beginning. I started getting nervous once it started and all these other big names weren’t going off the board too quick.”\n\nMacKenzie Gore will make his first start of spring training Sunday, and Jake Irvin will come next; each is slated to pitch two innings, to be followed by Kyle Finnegan, Hunter Harvey, Amos Willingham, Joe La Sorsa and Luis Perdomo. Josiah Gray is slated to start Monday, followed by Davies on Tuesday.\n\nSo far at camp, Zimmerman has been involved in morning workouts, and he has been getting to know the team’s young core better. But Zimmerman wants to grow in his understanding of the front-office side of the game as well. He has been sitting in on coaches’ meetings as well as gatherings with Rizzo.\n\n“That’s kind of my goal this year, to continue doing what I’m doing with the players and especially the young guys,” Zimmerman said Friday. “Also for myself, kind of learning the ins and outs of the other side and kind of become a little bit more knowledgeable so that I can better have suggestions.”\n\nFor the Nationals to build another championship team, Zimmerman said, it’s important to convince some of the squad’s young players to sign long-term contracts before they reach free agency. The Nationals signed catcher Keibert Ruiz to an eight-year, $50 million extension last spring. To do more deals such as that, Zimmerman believes the Nationals have to create an environment in which players want to stay.\n\nIt’s easier, of course, to make a commitment after Lerner announced his family’s intentions to hold on to the team. Zimmerman believes the Lerners’ past sets the precedent for what they could do in the future.\n\n“It’s not like they never spent,” he said. “... We had good payrolls for the better part of 10 years. … Now that he came out and said we’re not selling the team, let’s do it again — and let’s do it the right way.”",

(Nate Billings/AP)OKLAHOMA CITY — Eugene Omoruyi walked onto the court late in the first quarter of a 147-106 Washington Wizards loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday as the first of a handful of players unfamiliar with hearing their numbers called before halftime or even the fourth quarter. He was followed shortly thereafter by Johnny Davis, the 2022 lottery pick who has played early stints here and there but not often. And a bit later by Patrick Baldwin Jr., the center whose most significant minutes have come when his team was about to trade two of the big men in front of him to Detroit. Welcome to the Wizards’ 26-game run to the season’s finish, in which the nightly box scores are going to get a little bit funkier and a whole lot more eclectic — even if the Wizards continue their slide. Friday’s loss was their 10th straight.Still, rebuilding Washington (9-47) is looking at this last chunk of the schedule as a stretch that could vault them into next season with positive momentum. “We want this to be this time where we look back and say, ‘This was our foundational stretch where we found our identity,’ ” point guard Tyus Jones said Thursday. To do that, the Wizards’ brass needs to figure out whom it wants to bring on the ride.That means there will be a fair bit of experimentation beyond just moving Jordan Poole to the bench, though the guard responded to that change by leading the Wizards with 21 points on 7-for-19 shooting in 22 minutes Friday.“We’re still finding our rhythm with [the new rotations]. The one positive is you see Jordan getting to the free throw line more,” interim coach Brian Keefe said. “. . . That shows that he’s getting downhill and attacking, and if we can get our free throws up, that’s a great way to make us more efficient.”The Wizards are going to take a good look at Omoruyi, the 6-foot-6, 235-pound small forward playing on a two-way contract who finished with seven points and one rebound Friday. Omoruyi, who goes by Geno around the locker room, is built like an oak tree and has a penchant for scoring in bunches and a reputation for providing furious energy.They’re going to take a good look at Baldwin Jr., the 6-9, 220-pound center who arrived in a trade from Golden State last summer with Poole and is eager to prove himself up to the challenge of tough defensive assignments. He finished with three points in 16 minutes and had two rebounds.They’re going to take another look at Davis to see whether all the time he has spent in the G League this season has provided the necessary springboard to becoming a dependable NBA player. Friday wasn’t a promising start, though Keefe praised his physicality: Davis went 1 for 8 from the field for two points in 17 minutes. He had seven rebounds but committed several defensive errors.“I thought those guys gave us good minutes,” Keefe said. “Those guys were all in the game when we made a run — I think we cut it to five — and they were all in the game playing good team basketball. So we’re going to continue to explore our roster and develop them for the rest of the year.”Experimentation further up the roster will look more like putting established players into less familiar roles. The Wizards want to see how Deni Avdija, who was a late scratch for Friday’s game with a foot injury, responds with the ball in his hands more. Or whether Jones can be a catch-and-shoot threat on offense.So far, all the trial and error has yielded ugliness. After Denver romped through the paint Thursday, the Thunder (39-17) shot 59.8 percent from the field and never gave the Wizards a glimmer of a chance. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led with 30 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Chet Holmgren had 25 assists and 10 rebounds.Washington’s defensive struggles led to poor offense for the starters — Corey Kispert added 20 points off the bench to Poole’s 21, and Marvin Bagley III toiled his way to 15 points and 14 rebounds in 21 minutes. Kyle Kuzma added 14 points.On Friday, at least, the Wizards’ experiments fizzled.“We’re at that point in the season where a lot of different guys are going to be in the rotation, a lot of different guys are going to be on the roster,” Kuzma said. “It’s a little bit bigger than finding a rhythm. … It’s all about the habits. It’s cliché, but that’s the only things that you can look forward to trying to improve every day.”Here’s what else to know from the Wizards’ loss:A left heel contusion caused Avdija to miss Friday’s game, a rarity for the durable 23-year-old. It was the first game Avdija has missed all season and just the sixth in the past three seasons. He played all 82 games in 2021-22, his second year in the league, after shutting down his rookie season early because of injury.Washington signed forward Justin Champagnie (pronounced “sham-penny”) to a 10-day contract Thursday to bring its roster up to 14 players after buying out veteran guard Delon Wright over the all-star break.The front office plans to rotate through a host of candidates before deciding on someone for the longer term. That leaves players such as Champagnie, who has 34 G League games with the Sioux Falls Skyforce and 15 double-doubles under his belt this season, in the unenviable positioning of showing what they have in scant minutes over a span of three games or so.He had four points in five minutes of action Friday.The Wizards’ poor defense Thursday allowed for a history-making night in Denver for Nikola Jokic, who became the fourth player in NBA history to record a triple-double against every team he has faced. Jokic, who went 10 for 10 from the field for 21 points, 19 rebounds and 15 assists, also became the first NBA player to shoot at least 10 for 10 from the field with at least 15 rebounds and 15 assists in a game.Russell Westbrook and LeBron James, who have played for multiple teams, have logged triple-doubles against all 30 teams in the league. Hall of Famer Maurice Stokes did so against the other seven teams that made up the NBA when he played.The Wizards keep experimenting, even as the losses continueThe Wizards keep experimenting, even as the losses continueBilal Coulibaly wants to prove he belongs, but he’s clearly differentBilal Coulibaly wants to prove he belongs, but he’s clearly differentEven with new chefs, the Tabard Inn’s history outshines its foodKim Lai, co-founder of Four Sisters Vietnamese restaurant, dies at 77Sign in or create a free account to save your preferences",

At what point is it too much?“I love to tinker,” Josiah Gray said. “I love to figure out what I can do with the baseball, just because of how the game is and how the seams of the baseball work.” (Saul Martinez for The Washington Post WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Washington Nationals right-hander Josiah Gray has always liked to tinker, going back to his days as a player at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, N. Y. The challenge was always finding ways to get better every day. He would implement new approaches. He would watch videos online about what to add or subtract from his game.Now, the 26-year-old has more resources at his disposal.“I love to tinker,” Gray said. “I love to figure out what I can do with the baseball, just because of how the game is and how the seams of the baseball work.”Baseball is a game of adjustments. Pitchers tweak their arsenals from season to season. They use in-season bullpen sessions to fine-tune their pitches. They alter their game plans. Anything to get an edge.Gray is no different. He added a cutter, a sinker and a sweeper to his repertoire last season. He dropped his four-seam fastball usage significantly from the previous year. He used two different windups to maintain a proper direction to the plate.Gray is coming off an all-star season in which he made significant strides. So now the question becomes: At what point does the tinkering stop? At what point will Gray find the right mix of pitches? And, if he keeps tinkering, will Gray ever find who he is as a pitcher?“You have to look at it in the big picture,” Nationals pitching strategist Sean Doolittle said. “[Just because] you feel a little off on a given day doesn’t necessarily mean you go into the video room and look to start tinkering with things. It’s hard to do as a player because you’re constantly trying to get better, constantly trying to make adjustments to stay ahead of the league.”Gray was exhausted after a long 2023 season. He spent most of October watching postseason baseball. Toward the end of the month, he felt the urge to get back to work. He had a strong first half, pitching to a 3.41 ERA. But his 1.435 WHIP signaled that a regression could come. He had a 4.76 ERA in the second half of the season. He cut his home runs per nine innings nearly in half from 2022 to 2023 but still walked more hitters per nine innings. So some more tinkering was necessary.Gray also changed his delivery in the final month of the 2023 season, starting it as if he was working out of the stretch. He plans to stick with that approach this season, saying it gives him more stability. But he likes certain aspects of his old delivery, so he could revert to the technique.Gray spent most of the offseason at a sports performance facility in Florida. Gray tweaked his sinker, hoping to generate more horizontal movement than vertical. He had a lot of success with his sinker in his final start of 2023 and wanted to build on it. He threw the sinker primarily to righties last season but wants to throw it more to lefties this year.“I kept on tinkering with it, and I think it’s in a good spot where I’ll roll it out early in games here and see what we’ve got,” said Gray, who is expected to make his first start of spring training Monday.Pitching coach Jim Hickey wanted Gray to throw his change-up more often. Gray altered his grip this offseason, widening his hands for more of a split change-up grip vs. a traditional change-up. He wants to release it off his fingers differently. The hope is that the change-up will have more drop.Gray said feedback from Nationals hitters in West Palm Beach will help determine whether the changes have helped. He wants to have multiple pitches at his disposal but also wants them to fit in his arsenal. Having an improved change-up or sinker doesn’t mean he has to significantly raise the usage of either pitch if it doesn’t fit into his game plan.Nationals Manager Dave Martinez wants Gray, who can deploy seven pitches, to develop three or four he can throw really well. One could argue that in order for Gray’s secondary pitches to be more effective, he needs to establish his four-seam fastball early in games. Gray threw his fastball 38.9 percent of the time in 2022, though it was often ineffective. Last season, that dropped to 17 percent.“I’m hoping that he understands coming in this spring who he is and what makes him really good,” Martinez said. “And I’m hoping that, by talking to him, that a lot of the tinkering is going to go away this year.”Josiah Gray tinkers with his game often.

  "text": "Fifty-seven games into a lost season, the Washington Wizards are well beyond the point of trying to move up the standings. Now they’re in it for silver linings and morsels of hope. During a 114-105 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night at Capital One Arena, there were plenty of positives. Down three rotation players, the Wizards (9-48) pushed the No. 2 team in the Eastern Conference. They led 94-88 with 9:17 left after a fallaway three-pointer by Jordan Poole brought the crowd to its feet. But they faltered down the stretch, extending their season-worst losing streak to 11 games.\n\n“[We] shouldn’t be happy we lost,” interim coach Brian Keefe said. “We’re never happy about that. But we should be about the process. … That looked like the team that we have been building, and if we keep stacking those type of habits, repeatable actions that we showed tonight, that will lead to the win. So we’re focused on the process on how to get there, and I thought our guys made a great step in that direction tonight.”\n\nPoole’s performance in his third game since he was relegated to a reserve role was a standout. When the Wizards hosted the Cavaliers on Feb. 7, he was held scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting, drawing boos from the Capital One Arena crowd. This time, Poole powered mini bursts of offense, caught fire from beyond the arc (he finished 6 for 13) and engaged the fans throughout the night, finishing with 31 points, five rebounds and five assists.\n\n“Jordan has played well for us,” Keefe said. “Now we’re seeing him in a different type of role, the ball in his hands a little bit more. And we’re seeing incremental gains in the last three games from this.”\n\nKyle Kuzma added 27 points, seven rebounds and five assists for Washington, which was plenty shorthanded. Deni Avdija, the fourth-year forward in the midst of a breakout season, missed his second consecutive game with a left heel contusion. Reserve forward Corey Kispert was a late scratch with a non-covid illness. And rookie Bilal Coulibaly was limited to six minutes after taking a hard fall in the first quarter. The Wizards said he suffered a right pelvis contusion.\n\nReturning from a two-game absence because of an illness, the Cavaliers’ Donovan Mitchell managed just 16 points on 4-for-10 shooting. It was a far cry from the teams’ meeting earlier this month, when Mitchell torched the Wizards for 40 points. He entered Sunday as the NBA’s fourth-leading scorer at 28.4 points per game.\n\nInstead of getting Mitchell’s usual production, the Cavaliers (37-19) outscored the Wizards in the paint 60-48. Much of the damage came on layups, hook shots and dunks by Cleveland’s frontcourt duo of Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley, who combined for 43 points on 20-for-29 shooting. Allen added 12 rebounds and five assists; Mobley had six rebounds and five blocks.\n\n“We did a great job on Donovan Mitchell tonight, trying to take him out of the game, but they were just a little bit bigger than us,” Kuzma said.\n\nSunday was the Wizards’ 11th consecutive game — all losses — against a team with a winning record. Since returning from the all-star break, Washington has lost by 20 at defending champion Denver, by 41 at contender Oklahoma City and by nine to Cleveland.\n\nWashington’s upcoming schedule is no less forgiving. The Wizards host Golden State (29-27) on Tuesday before heading to Los Angeles to face the Lakers (31-28) on Thursday and the Clippers (37-18 entering Sunday night) on Friday.\n\nBut Keefe said he was pleased with what he saw from Davis on the defensive end, where he was often tasked with guarding Mitchell or Darius Garland (17 points).\n\n“Johnny has been great for the last three games,” Keefe said. “His defense has been great. His defensive rebounding has been great. He brings great energy. But that’s kind of the role we envision for him. He’s been a positive on the defensive end.”\n\nAfter committing his fifth foul with 9:39 left in the third quarter, Davis went to the bench, shaking his head in frustration, and did not return.\n\n“It’s definitely tough, but it’s also fun,” he said of his defensive assignments. “I love guarding guys like that, and you really get to see why they’re the best players in the league.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nWith his first spring training homer, James Wood made a young fan’s yearWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The teenager was sitting in the grass beyond the right field fence with his best friend when he heard the crack of the bat. Then he saw the ball in the air. Forget that piece of pretzel in his hand — he dropped it in the grass and made a beeline for the back of the lawn.“I was just like, ‘Oh, my God, no way,’ ” Michael Hecker said. There were others with the same goal, hoping the ball off the bat of Washington Nationals prospect James Wood would land at their feet. They would reach down and grab it. They would hold it up in jubilation. Maybe in the dream, they would hold the remains of their broken pretzel with the wrapper in the other hand — as Hecker did.“That home run just made my year — and it’s only February,” Hecker said.Hecker and his best friend, Jayden Vazquez, both 15, came to the ballpark Saturday to watch the Nationals and Houston Astros work out. Hecker is a Mets fan — he’s originally from New York — but his family moved to nearby Boynton Beach, Fla., a few years ago. He wore a Jose Altuve jersey Saturday strictly so he could get an autograph. They didn’t even know there was a game that night, but once they did, they paid $28 to sit on the lawn.Spring training gives fans a chance to get an up-close-and-personal look at players they admire. They stand along the fences with pens and baseballs, yelling players’ names as they walk from one field to another. Before games, they huddle down the foul line or by the dugout with baseball cards.But it wasn’t until Saturday that Hecker saw Wood and learned who he was.From last year: The outsize world of James WoodThat home run — seeing as it came in spring training — probably meant little to Wood. The 21-year-old has slugged 41 in his minor league career. He’s trying to make it to the majors, where he hopes there will be plenty more. After the game, Wood said he didn’t know where the ball landed. Asked what’s next, he replied: “Another game tomorrow.”For Hecker, that baseball was worth much more.“It means everything to me,” he said. “I mean, that’s awesome. I’ve never gotten a home run at a baseball game before. … That’s like an achievement for me.”Less than an hour after the game, Hecker and Vazquez sat on a curb in the parking lot. Every few seconds, they would peek into the Nationals’ facility to see whether Wood was coming their way.“Likely he’ll go out the other side, but you never know,” Vazquez said.“I got the ball in my pocket just in case he comes,” Hecker said.A few minutes later, Hecker and Vazquez would head home. Wood never did come out, but he already had made their night a few hours earlier.On Sunday, Wood picked up where he left off with a two-run blast in the fifth inning against the Miami Marlins. The homer came on a sweeper by lefty Devin Smeltzer and one-hopped off the batter’s eye in center field at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Fla.Lewin Díaz followed with a two-run homer in the sixth that propelled the Nationals to a 6-3 victory. Díaz, a first baseman on a minor league contract, is trying to make the roster after playing with Miami from 2020 to 2022.“It’s good to see the kid get off like that early in camp,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “He does everything really the right way, even when you watch him play defense. ... I love watching him play. He’s going to be special.”MacKenzie Gore started Sunday’s game; over two innings, he threw an efficient 26 pitches with 21 strikes. The left-hander, who turned 25 on Saturday, allowed one run while striking out four. His fastball was lively up in the strike zone, and he threw his curveball often — when he was ahead in the count and, perhaps more notably, when he was behind.“I thought it was good,” Gore said of his spring debut. “We continued to work on what we’ve been doing all season to the beginning of the spring. I liked how we stuck to the plan.”Right-hander Trevor Williams greeted his teammates and coaches with hugs after reporting to camp Sunday. He had an excused absence: the birth of his fifth child, a second daughter named Monica. Williams said he doesn’t feel as if he’s behind.He faced live hitters Friday in San Diego, even though they were high-schoolers. Martinez said Williams probably will throw a live bullpen session Tuesday, then throw a side session. After that, he should be ready to pitch in a game.“I feel like the only thing I was missing was the lights, the stadium,” Williams said. “I feel like my body is where it needs to be. My brain is catching up now that I’m here. My mind will be in season mode hopefully here soon.”Williams enters camp as the Nationals’ fifth starter, but nothing is guaranteed after his performance last season. He lost velocity and struggled with command during the second half, in part because of his workload. In all, the 31-year-old had a 5.55 ERA in 30 starts, but he will have every opportunity to earn the job again.It’s clear the young Nats are on the way.

  "text": "Lai and his wife, Thanh Tran, opened their first restaurant, Huong Que, in 1993 in a cursed corner of Eden Center, the Falls Church, Va., shopping center dedicated to Vietnamese food and culture. Several businesses had come and gone from the space, a parade of failures that led some at the center to dub it the “bad-luck place.”\n\nThe Lai family would break the spell. The attraction was Tran’s menu, an extensive survey of Vietnamese homestyle cooking, including pho, hot pots, papaya salad, spring rolls, steamed rice crepes and dozens of other dishes. If Tran was the restaurant’s star in the kitchen, Lai was the conductor in the dining room. He was a consummate host in those early, make-or-break days, remembers Le Lai. Nothing escaped his attention. In days before smartphones, he watched over every diner, even the solo ones, who can be easily ignored in a dining room with larger, more profitable parties.\n\nHuong Que translates to a “taste of home” in English, said Lieu Lai-Williams, the couple’s youngest daughter. And that’s exactly what the restaurant was for many Vietnamese immigrants: a chance to experience the flavors of a homeland that millions had to flee after Saigon fell to communist forces in 1975. Lines formed outside the door at Huong Que, which persuaded Eden Center management in 1997 to offer the Lai family a more spacious, more coveted location facing the sprawling parking lot at the shopping center.\n\nThe restaurant might have remained a treasure known only to the Vietnamese community if not for a December 1997 review from Phyllis C. Richman, then food critic for The Post. Richman recommended a number of dishes, but she raved about the service. “These waitresses are the greatest asset of Huong Que,” the critic wrote. “They orchestrate your meal, show you how to wrap and what to dip among the plates of meats and seafood, lettuce and fresh herbs.”\n\nThree of the servers featured in a photo that accompanied Richman’s review were Lai and Tran’s daughters. Their fourth daughter, Lieu, was then too young to work the dining room floor, but she would soon join her siblings. Together, the sisters would become the faces of Huong Que, relegating their father to other front-of-the-house duties, including cashier.\n\nRichman’s review expanded Huong Que’s reach. It also led to a name change — or more of a name addition. The Lai family supplemented Huong Que with a secondary, English-language handle, so its new Western fans wouldn’t fumble the pronunciation. Starting around 1998, the restaurant became known as Huong Que/Four Sisters, an acknowledgment of the four daughters’ growing visibility within the four walls of the establishment.\n\nHuong Que/Four Sisters also started making regular appearances on best-of lists by The Post, Washingtonian magazine and other publications, arguably the city’s first Vietnamese restaurant to gain mainstream status in the D. C. region. Local chefs began to make trips to Eden Center to eat at the restaurant, including Patrick O’Connell, the founder and proprietor of the three Michelin-starred Inn at Little Washington.\n\nLai was born in 1946 in Bien Hoa, just outside Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon. His father was Chinese and his mother Vietnamese. Lai’s first aspiration was to become a professional soccer player. He was talented enough to “represent Bien Hoa in Vietnam Football Federation competitions,” according to his obituary. But Lai was also entrepreneurial by nature. He had started a motorcycle parts business in Bien Hoa, which he abandoned when he and the family decided to uproot and move to the United States.\n\nLai, Tran and their six children landed in Northern Virginia in 1982, carrying two black trash bags, which represented all their worldly possessions. They had little grasp of the English language and few marketable skills. Both Lai and Tran worked two jobs each to make ends meet. Lai worked at a Krispy Kreme and as a dishwasher at a Hilton hotel in Washington. Both parents labored so long and hard that they were barely a presence in their children’s lives. Child care often fell on the eldest daughter, Ly Lai.\n\nBut Lai and Tran earned enough money to buy an old food truck, which they used to sell hot dogs and other convenience foods on the National Mall. It was the family’s first taste of running their own business in the United States, and it would eventually lead to the opening of Huong Que.\n\nOver the years, all six of Lai and Tran’s children worked at Huong Que/Four Sisters or the family’s Vietnamese deli, Song Que, which debuted in the early 2000s in Eden Center. (The deli closed in 2014.) Two daughters, Le and Lieu, stuck it out to the very end. They were the co-owners of Four Sisters in Merrifield, where the family relocated the original restaurant in 2008 and ditched the Vietnamese part of the business name.\n\nSome of Lai and Tran’s children splintered off from the family business to start their own restaurants. Ly Lai and her husband, Sly Liao, launched their own place in Merrifield, Sea Pearl, which is now closed. Hoa Lai and his wife, Joyce, debuted the casual Four Sisters Grill in 2014 in Arlington, which is now run by Ly and her spouse. Youngest son Thuan Lai and his wife, Angela, opened 4 Sisters Asian Snack Bar in 2018. LoAnn Lai runs her own salon in Georgetown.",

  "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — With a flick of the wrist in the fifth inning, James Wood sent the first pitch he saw Saturday night into orbit. It carried. It carried some more. It seemed the ball would never land, but it finally descended into the outfield grass beyond the right field fence. Fans converged, trying to grab the missile that landed at their feet.\n\nThe Nationals lost, 7-4, to the Houston Astros at Park of the Palm Beaches in their spring training opener, but the final score was far from the story. This game was all about prospects getting their first shot to show what they can do.\n\nAfter the 21-year-old slugger’s majestic home run, fellow outfielder Robert Hassell III, 22, followed with a line drive that turned into a triple; he scored in the ensuing at-bat. By the sixth inning, soon-to-be-22-year-old Dylan Crews replaced Victor Robles in center field. He made a sliding catch in the seventh to rob the Astros of a hit.\n\nBefore the top prospects entered, Patrick Corbin threw 50 pitches over 1⅔ innings and allowed two runs. He had four strikeouts, all of them with his new cutter. Then the youngsters got their chance. Jackson Rutledge, 24, tossed two scoreless innings on an efficient 31 pitches. Then came the three outfielders, who all provided a glimpse of what is hopefully to come.\n\n“This is going to be a fun spring training,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “One, we got to get our guys ready and, two, we’re going to see a lot of these young kids. ... It keeps me busy, but it’s a lot of fun. It’s a good busy.”\n\nReliever Dylan Floro is dealing with shoulder tightness but is still throwing every day. The 33-year old right-hander, who signed in December, didn’t recover well from his latest bullpen session. Floro said he has dealt with this feeling during past spring trainings, so he isn’t alarmed but wants to be cautious. He doesn’t believe he will need that many innings to get himself ready for Opening Day.\n\nGeneral Manager Mike Rizzo opened camp by saying it was unlikely the Nationals would pursue any more major league contracts. But he did leave the door open for minor league deals to give the team depth in case of injuries. Since camp opened, the Nationals agreed to deals with reliever Jacob Barnes, starter Zach Davies and, most recently, reliever Derek Law.\n\nBarnes, 33, is an eight-year veteran who has played for eight teams since 2019. Davies, 31, has made 200 career starts. Law, 33, had one of the best years of his career last season with Cincinnati, finishing with a 3.60 ERA in 55 innings before he was non-tendered in November. Law was holding out hope for a major league deal and was surprised he didn’t get one.\n\n“Yeah, a little bit,” he said. “But you could tell the way free agency was going at the beginning. I started getting nervous once it started and all these other big names weren’t going off the board too quick.”\n\nMacKenzie Gore will make his first start of spring training Sunday, and Jake Irvin will come next; each is slated to pitch two innings, to be followed by Kyle Finnegan, Hunter Harvey, Amos Willingham, Joe La Sorsa and Luis Perdomo. Josiah Gray is slated to start Monday, followed by Davies on Tuesday.\n\nSo far at camp, Zimmerman has been involved in morning workouts, and he has been getting to know the team’s young core better. But Zimmerman wants to grow in his understanding of the front-office side of the game as well. He has been sitting in on coaches’ meetings as well as gatherings with Rizzo.\n\n“That’s kind of my goal this year, to continue doing what I’m doing with the players and especially the young guys,” Zimmerman said Friday. “Also for myself, kind of learning the ins and outs of the other side and kind of become a little bit more knowledgeable so that I can better have suggestions.”\n\nFor the Nationals to build another championship team, Zimmerman said, it’s important to convince some of the squad’s young players to sign long-term contracts before they reach free agency. The Nationals signed catcher Keibert Ruiz to an eight-year, $50 million extension last spring. To do more deals such as that, Zimmerman believes the Nationals have to create an environment in which players want to stay.\n\nIt’s easier, of course, to make a commitment after Lerner announced his family’s intentions to hold on to the team. Zimmerman believes the Lerners’ past sets the precedent for what they could do in the future.\n\n“It’s not like they never spent,” he said. “... We had good payrolls for the better part of 10 years. … Now that he came out and said we’re not selling the team, let’s do it again — and let’s do it the right way.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nIt’s clear the young Nats are on the way. Less clear: Who will lead them. Lane Thomas is entering his third full year with the Nationals. (Saul Martinez for The Washington Post) WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — It was the first game of spring training, the Washington Nationals were down 7-0, and Lane Thomas’s job to prepare for the season ahead was to take one more at-bat and get the heck out of there. The game was not televised back in Washington. A quiet crowd of 3,655 watched with faint interest. Thomas tapped the ball toward third base and ran — hard.“As you mature, you understand what you need to do and cope with how you are going to prepare yourself,” Thomas said. “Not necessarily doing it because the strength coach is watching or because [the manager is] watching and he doesn’t know me completely yet. It’s more like getting all that stuff down because, you know, ‘This is what I need to do.’ ”What Thomas needs to do is prepare hard and play hard, regardless of the stage of spring training or the season. And what the Nationals need from Thomas is to do just that: certainly to prepare himself for what’s ahead but also to get a clubhouse full of youngsters and castoffs to understand what professional preparation looks like.Thomas’s position in the organization wasn’t going to be determined by whether he busted tail and beat out that roller in the fourth inning of the Nationals’ Grapefruit League opener. (He did beat it out, by the way.) And his position in the organization isn’t to be overstated, because he has been a full-time major league starter for just two seasons. Any sway he holds is more by default than from accomplishment.The corner of the Nats clubhouse at Park of the Palm Beaches is inhabited by CJ Abrams, Luis García Jr., Carter Kieboom, Ildemaro Vargas, Joey Gallo, Victor Robles, Nick Senzel and Thomas. It says something about the club’s current state that such territory once housed Jayson Werth, Bryce Harper, Ryan Zimmerman, Trea Turner, Anthony Rendon, Daniel Murphy, Howie Kendrick, Adam Eaton and the like.The most important aspect of the Nationals’ rebuild will be talent. Some of it’s here already, and it’s apparent in Dylan Crews’s batting practice shot off a scoreboard Saturday — a blast that knocked off a piece of the apparatus and may have ownership sending him a bill — and, more impressively, James Wood’s towering moonshot in Saturday night’s game against the Houston Astros.The kids are here, and the kids are coming. But when they arrive, who will lead them? That question is both unanswered and important.“Leadership happens when it’s organic,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said. “When you force-feed it, it never works. So I think you will see someone emerge. One or three or four will emerge as guys that people will follow. And it’s not always the best player on the team.”Fairly or not — and I would argue fairly — any Nats renaissance will be compared, in stages, to the first one because, before they won a championship, they had a foundation solid enough to be annually competitive. And before they were annually competitive, they were terrible. At the major league level, the Nats are still at or near the terrible phase.But part of the future foundation must be rooted in attitude and approach. On the pitching side, Patrick Corbin, for all his struggles — and they are many — has taught professionalism to the kids around him, not to mention organized meals and picked up the tab. That stuff matters.Corbin’s contract is up after this year. Thomas, not due to be a free agent until after the 2025 season, will remain. When the prospects arrive, someone will have to be in place as a tone-setter. As Thomas, coming off a year in which he hit 28 homers, drove in 86 runs and stole 20 bases, continues to discover himself, he could help set that tone.The Lerners are holding on to the Nats. Here’s why that makes sense (for now).“At first, he didn’t really know what his identity was and what he could be,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “And over the course of the couple of years we’ve had him, he understands what he can do and what he can’t do with it.”When Thomas arrived in a throwaway deadline deal for left-hander Jon Lester in 2021, he came with a career OPS of .625 in 142 plate appearances over parts of three seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals. After a deadline in which Max Scherzer and Turner were dealt away, Lester-for-Thomas was an afterthought. But Thomas has transformed himself into Washington’s everyday right fielder. With the Nats, he has a .763 OPS in 1,436 plate appearances.“Every time he gets in the box,” Martinez said, “he has the chance to do something special.”One reason that’s true, though, is because he doesn’t prepare as if he’s established. He prepares as if he has to prove it. Nothing against anybody in the Nats’ clubhouse, but Thomas looks around the room, he said, and thinks, “You’re not taking my job.”“I think that’s a hard thing to do,” he said. “You kind of want to be happy-go-lucky, but sometimes stuff like that hurts guys. They get a little too friendly with each other. Not in a bad way, but you know, there’s still a competitive nature to all this. Guys are fighting for jobs. So I try not to lose that mind-set going into spring. I’m still going to earn my position.”The Nationals believe he has earned it, and thus he was out of the lineup for Sunday’s game up the road in Jupiter. The privileges of a veteran include infrequent spring training travel. The Nationals who have earned them just have fewer credentials than the group that once occupied that part of the clubhouse. Still, there’s something to be learned about the style and methods with which the generation that preceded this one delivered their messages.With his first spring training homer, James Wood made a young fan’s year“Zimmerman didn’t say ‘boo,’ ” Rizzo said. “But when he said ‘boo,’ the world stopped. Everyone heard him say it, you know?”The new Nats are learning who will deliver those messages and how they will get them across. On Sunday against the Miami Marlins, the future — which is creeping closer to the present — was again on display. MacKenzie Gore looked sharp — 26 pitches, 21 strikes — over two innings with four strikeouts. Wood jacked another homer on another effortless swing, this one to center. Robert Hassell III drove in a run. Crews patrolled center field confidently and drew a walk.The kids are coming. When they arrive, someone will have to lead them. It’s a development process that might not be as important as cultivating the talent on hand, but it’s close.It’s clear the young Nats are on the way. Less clear: Who will lead them.It’s clear the young Nats are on the way.

  "text": "From Jan. 15 through the end of June, Republican candidates for president compete to earn enough delegates to secure their party’s nomination. Here’s where the race stands now.\n\nThere are 2,429 total delegates available, and a candidate must win at least 1,215 to secure the nomination. Some election days have multiple state primaries happening simultaneously. A whopping 874 delegates are at stake on March 5, also know as Super Tuesday, when 16 states hold their elections.\n\nHow the delegates are distributed to the candidates depends on the rules of each state. For example, states like California allocate all of their delegates to the candidate who wins the primary (the “winner-take-all” method), while others like Iowa and New Hampshire give delegates to candidates based on their share of the vote in that state or territory (the “proportional” method).\n\nSee all delegate results below. Every state holds a primary or caucus, and so do U. S. territories like the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nWith his first spring training homer, James Wood made a young fan’s yearWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The teenager was sitting in the grass beyond the right field fence with his best friend when he heard the crack of the bat. Then he saw the ball in the air. Forget that piece of pretzel in his hand — he dropped it in the grass and made a beeline for the back of the lawn.“I was just like, ‘Oh, my God, no way,’ ” Michael Hecker said. There were others with the same goal, hoping the ball off the bat of Washington Nationals prospect James Wood would land at their feet. They would reach down and grab it. They would hold it up in jubilation. Maybe in the dream, they would hold the remains of their broken pretzel with the wrapper in the other hand — as Hecker did.“That home run just made my year — and it’s only February,” Hecker said.Hecker and his best friend, Jayden Vazquez, both 15, came to the ballpark Saturday to watch the Nationals and Houston Astros work out. Hecker is a Mets fan — he’s originally from New York — but his family moved to nearby Boynton Beach, Fla., a few years ago. He wore a Jose Altuve jersey Saturday strictly so he could get an autograph. They didn’t even know there was a game that night, but once they did, they paid $28 to sit on the lawn.Spring training gives fans a chance to get an up-close-and-personal look at players they admire. They stand along the fences with pens and baseballs, yelling players’ names as they walk from one field to another. Before games, they huddle down the foul line or by the dugout with baseball cards.But it wasn’t until Saturday that Hecker saw Wood and learned who he was.From last year: The outsize world of James WoodThat home run — seeing as it came in spring training — probably meant little to Wood. The 21-year-old has slugged 41 in his minor league career. He’s trying to make it to the majors, where he hopes there will be plenty more. After the game, Wood said he didn’t know where the ball landed. Asked what’s next, he replied: “Another game tomorrow.”For Hecker, that baseball was worth much more.“It means everything to me,” he said. “I mean, that’s awesome. I’ve never gotten a home run at a baseball game before. … That’s like an achievement for me.”Less than an hour after the game, Hecker and Vazquez sat on a curb in the parking lot. Every few seconds, they would peek into the Nationals’ facility to see whether Wood was coming their way.“Likely he’ll go out the other side, but you never know,” Vazquez said.“I got the ball in my pocket just in case he comes,” Hecker said.A few minutes later, Hecker and Vazquez would head home. Wood never did come out, but he already had made their night a few hours earlier.On Sunday, Wood picked up where he left off with a two-run blast in the fifth inning against the Miami Marlins. The homer came on a sweeper by lefty Devin Smeltzer and one-hopped off the batter’s eye in center field at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Fla.Lewin Díaz followed with a two-run homer in the sixth that propelled the Nationals to a 6-3 victory. Díaz, a first baseman on a minor league contract, is trying to make the roster after playing with Miami from 2020 to 2022.“It’s good to see the kid get off like that early in camp,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “He does everything really the right way, even when you watch him play defense. ... I love watching him play. He’s going to be special.”MacKenzie Gore started Sunday’s game; over two innings, he threw an efficient 26 pitches with 21 strikes. The left-hander, who turned 25 on Saturday, allowed one run while striking out four. His fastball was lively up in the strike zone, and he threw his curveball often — when he was ahead in the count and, perhaps more notably, when he was behind.“I thought it was good,” Gore said of his spring debut. “We continued to work on what we’ve been doing all season to the beginning of the spring. I liked how we stuck to the plan.”Right-hander Trevor Williams greeted his teammates and coaches with hugs after reporting to camp Sunday. He had an excused absence: the birth of his fifth child, a second daughter named Monica. Williams said he doesn’t feel as if he’s behind.He faced live hitters Friday in San Diego, even though they were high-schoolers. Martinez said Williams probably will throw a live bullpen session Tuesday, then throw a side session. After that, he should be ready to pitch in a game.“I feel like the only thing I was missing was the lights, the stadium,” Williams said. “I feel like my body is where it needs to be. My brain is catching up now that I’m here. My mind will be in season mode hopefully here soon.”Williams enters camp as the Nationals’ fifth starter, but nothing is guaranteed after his performance last season. He lost velocity and struggled with command during the second half, in part because of his workload. In all, the 31-year-old had a 5.55 ERA in 30 starts, but he will have every opportunity to earn the job again.It’s clear the young Nats are on the way. Less clear: Who will lead them.It’s clear the young Nats are on the way.

  "text": "President Biden has been holding private lunches at the White House with top donors and other supporters as part of an effort to reassure them about his reelection campaign, including concerns about his age and energy, according to three people familiar with the meetings. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.Biden has held roughly a half-dozen meetings, in groups ranging from four to eight people, since he launched his campaign in April, but many of them occurred just before the holidays, the people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nPeople familiar with the meetings say there is no set agenda, and the conversations have covered a range of topics, including how to take on former president Donald Trump, the Israel-Gaza conflict and abortion rights. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the movie mogul who is a national co-chair of Biden’s campaign and a longtime Democratic fundraiser, has been organizing the meetings.\n\nThe individuals who have been invited to the meetings are not just top donors, the people said, but rather make up a mix of people Biden has known for years and those who have become supporters more recently. Biden has enjoyed the ability to hear perspectives on political and policy matters from people outside of his presidential bubble, they said.\n\nAnother person familiar with the meetings said the recent gatherings are an improvement on sessions held in 2019 with major business figures and donors. Those events were more scripted around Biden’s plans for the presidency and were often a variation on his stump speech.\n\nIn contrast, the person said, the current meetings have gone a long way to reassure supporters about Biden’s energy and commitment. “It has dispelled anybody who has any doubts about his determination and his energy and his passion,” the person said.\n\nThe meetings this time are far more free-flowing, with the president effectively opening the floor so attendees can ask whatever is on their mind. The effect has been positive, the person said, both as a way of showing donors Biden’s command of issues and as a way of giving the president feedback.\n\n“It just gives him some seasoning. That is good. It gives him energy, which is very good,” the person said. “And these people who are wondering if he has lost a step, they leave and are like, ‘That was great.’ ”\n\nJust before year’s end, Biden’s ratings tied his record low, with 38 percent approving of his performance and 58 percent disapproving, according to a Washington Post average of 17 polls in November and December. Voters, including a majority of Democrats, say they are particularly concerned about Biden’s age and consistently rank it as a bigger problem for the president than for Trump, who is 77.\n\nBiden himself has expressed frustration about his low poll numbers, frequently complaining about them in private conversations with aides. In particular, Biden has grumbled about voters’ disapproval of his handling of the economy, despite strong economic indicators.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama has also raised concerns about Biden’s reelection campaign, telling the president’s aides and allies the Wilmington-based campaign needs to be empowered to make decisions without clearing them with the White House.\n\nDuring a private White House lunch with Biden in December, Obama discussed the structure of his own 2012 reelection campaign, when some of his top presidential aides left the White House to take charge of the reelection operation in Chicago. That is a sharp contrast from Biden’s approach of leaving his closest aides at the White House even though they are involved in all the key decisions made by the campaign.\n\nThe small-group meetings have all taken place at the White House in locations that are not official workspaces, meaning political activity is permissible, the people said, including the Map Room, the private dining room in the residence and the tennis pavilion.\n\nThe meetings occur at the White House instead of a restaurant or hotel in Washington because of the complicated logistics of moving the president and his security detail outside the White House, the people said.\n\nBiden has started to ramp up his political activity in recent days, holding his first two official campaign events in the past week. On Friday, he blasted Trump as a threat to democracy in a speech on the eve of the three-year anniversary of the Jan 6. insurrection.\n\nTwo days later, he traveled to Charleston, S. C., to rally Black supporters at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where a white supremacist fatally shot nine people in 2015. Biden is expected to travel to Nevada and Michigan for campaign events later this month.",

  "text": "Obama grew “animated” in discussing the 2024 election and former president Donald Trump’s potential return to power, one of the people said, and has suggested to Biden’s advisers that the campaign needs more top-level decision-makers at its headquarters in Wilmington, Del. — or it must empower the people already in place. Obama has not recommended specific individuals, but he has mentioned David Plouffe, who managed Obama’s 2008 race, as the type of senior strategist needed at the Biden campaign.\n\nObama’s conversation with Biden on the subject took place during a private lunch at the White House in recent months, one of the people said, a meeting that has not been previously reported. Biden, who has long used Obama as a sounding board, invited his former boss to lunch, and the two discussed a range of topics including the 2024 election.\n\nDuring the lunch, Obama noted the success of his reelection campaign structure in 2012, when some of his top presidential aides, including David Axelrod and Jim Messina, left the White House to take charge of the reelection operation in Chicago. That is a sharp contrast from Biden’s approach of leaving his closest aides at the White House even though they are involved in all the key decisions made by the campaign.\n\nObama has been even more explicit with people close to Biden, suggesting the campaign needs to move aggressively as Trump appears poised to quickly wrap up the Republican nomination. His concerns about the campaign structure were not tied to a specific moment, but rather his belief that campaigns need to be agile in competitive races, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations.\n\nJulie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager, is based at the campaign headquarters in Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, while the president’s top political advisers — Anita Dunn, Jen O’Malley Dillon, Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti — work more than 100 miles away at the White House. That means any important move by the campaign is run by the White House first, prompting concern among some Democrats as they head into a turbulent contest that is likely to require immediate responses to fast-moving developments.\n\n“Jim and I started building the structure in Chicago in the spring of ’11. President Biden has chosen to keep many of his key political advisers in the White House,” Axelrod wrote in a text message. “But by necessity, I would expect several of them will move fairly soon to the campaign itself.”\n\nBut some Democrats running on the ticket with Biden are worried. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who is running for her state’s open Senate seat, has expressed concern to allies that she may not be able to win if Biden is at the top of the ticket, according to people familiar with the conversations. A spokesman for Slotkin’s campaign said she “looks forward to running with President Biden.”\n\nOutside of urging structural changes, Obama’s sense of urgency about the upcoming presidential race has been reflected in his push to raise money for Biden’s effort. He has helped the Biden campaign raise $4 million in small-dollar donations, including $2.6 million through a “Meet the Presidents” contest where donors have the chance to meet Obama and Biden, Biden campaign officials said.\n\nThe relationship between Obama and the man who served as his vice president for eight years is a complex one. The two men developed a strong working relationship and their families bonded well, but aides to both men say the “bromance” depicted in some pop culture accounts was always an exaggeration. These days, Biden and Obama check in with each other periodically, and Obama remains close to many of his former staffers who now work in the White House.\n\nBut even Biden is frustrated by his public standing, frequently complaining about his low poll numbers in private conversations with aides. In one meeting shortly before Thanksgiving, he demanded to know what his team and his campaign staff were doing about it. The low approval ratings have persisted despite a humming economy, as the country added 216,000 jobs in December.\n\nJust before year’s end, Biden’s rating tied his record low, with 38 percent approving his performance and 58 percent disapproving, according to a Washington Post average of 17 polls in November and December. Voters, including a majority of Democrats, say they are particularly concerned about Biden’s age and consistently rank it as a bigger problem for the president, 81, than for Trump, 77.\n\nOn Friday, Biden held his first major official campaign event, traveling to Valley Forge, Pa., to give a speech blasting Trump as a threat to democracy on the eve of the anniversary of the attack on the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Biden launched his reelection campaign in April, but to date his political activity has largely been confined to fundraisers and a few appearances at political rallies hosted by outside groups.",

  "text": "D. C. residents may be able to clear their records of certain marijuana offenses after President Biden announced Friday that he will pardon those convicted of simple use and possession on certain federal lands and the nation’s capital.Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.It was not immediately clear how many District residents this would affect, but the announcement follows Biden’s proclamation last year pardoning thousands of people convicted of marijuana possession under federal law as part of a broader effort to rectify what he has said are unjustified disparities in drug sentencing. No one was released from prison after that 2022 announcement because, White House officials said at the time, there is no one currently in federal prison solely for simple possession of cannabis.\n\nThe announcement on Friday extends beyond covering only simple possession charges and now applies to attempted simple possession under both federal and District laws as well as simple possession or use on federal lands. It also extends to people who have not yet been charged with or convicted of federal or D. C. marijuana offenses. Biden urged governors across the nation to follow his lead with regard to state offenses.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for additional information on the scope of the president’s order. Biden also commuted the sentences of 11 nonviolent drug offenders Friday.\n\nBecause the District lacks the autonomy of a state, the U. S. attorney’s office, rather than the District’s local prosecutor, prosecutes local marijuana laws, and only the president has the power to pardon people convicted of D.C. law violations.\n\nFor Adam Eidinger, a longtime cannabis activist and co-founder of DC Marijuana Justice, which worked to legalize the drug in the city, Biden’s action did not go far enough. He criticized these pardons as a “nothingburger” and said Biden should be taking more substantial steps toward reform that releases people from behind bars.\n\n“This is once again the Biden administration attempting to look like they are doing something by doing very little,” said Eidinger, who organized a protest outside the White House last year to demand that Biden use his executive authority to release people incarcerated on nonviolent marijuana-related convictions.\n\nSimilarly, Sarah Gersten, the executive director of the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit working on cannabis criminal justice reform that has lobbied the White House on this issue, said she was “disappointed” with Biden’s announcement.\n\nHer organization has been urging Biden to grant clemency for anyone incarcerated federally for cannabis — an action that she said would help remedy the harms of “really punitive drug laws that of course disproportionately impacted communities of color.”\n\nGersten estimated that more than 3,000 people are in federal prison because of marijuana-related offenses, citing data from a 2021 report from Recidiviz, a nonprofit that uses technology and data to build tools for criminal justice reform.\n\nThe number of people charged in federal court for simple possession of marijuana has fallen swiftly in recent years, as policymakers and Americans more broadly have embraced more lenient views about the drug.\n\nThere were only 145 people sentenced solely on federal simple possession charges in 2021, down from 2,172 in 2014, according to a January report from the U. S. Sentencing Commission. More than 80 percent of those charges emanated from a single district in Arizona, the report found.\n\nA growing number of states and cities, including D. C., have reduced or eliminated penalties for marijuana possession over the past decade. Biden has called on governors to issue blanket pardons for state-level marijuana possession offenses, which make up the vast majority of cases and convictions nationwide.\n\nAs of January 2022, no one who had been sentenced solely for simple possession of marijuana remained in federal custody, according to the report.\n\n“These marijuana pardons will help thousands of people by making it easier for them to find a job, buy a home, and get an education,” Vice President Harris said in a statement. “We must continue to change our nation’s approach to marijuana and reform the criminal justice system. As I have declared many times before, no one should be in prison simply for smoking weed.”",

  "text": "Ahead of the vote, Democrats took to the House floor to denounce Republicans for engaging in what they described as a conspiracy-fueled fishing expedition designed as retribution for the two impeachments of former president Donald Trump. Republicans, meanwhile, argued that the administration was obstructing their investigation by failing to fully comply with the committees’ subpoenas, and accused the president of lying about his involvement with his son’s foreign business dealings.\n\n“Hunter Biden did a press conference — he was supposed to be in a deposition,” said House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). “And at that press conference, he said ‘my father was not financially involved in the business.’ Well, that’s an important qualifier. We haven’t heard that for three years. … All we’ve heard is Joe Biden had no involvement. Now his son does a press conference when he’s supposed to be being deposed and says he wasn’t financially involved. Well, what involvement was it?”\n\nThe foundation of the impeachment inquiry, outlined by Jordan in a briefing with reporters last week, rests on an unsubstantiated allegation that has become the linchpin of conspiracy theories and false claims regarding the Biden family’s purported corrupt and criminal conduct. Republicans have alleged without evidence that Joe Biden as vice president pushed for the firing of Ukraine’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to quash a probe into the former owner of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden sat on the board. Former U. S. officials, Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, and even some Republicans have rebutted that allegation.\n\nReferencing the impeachment vote, he added, “Instead of doing anything to help make Americans’ lives better, they are focused on attacking me with lies. Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done, they are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts.”\n\nSome vulnerable Republican lawmakers previously were resistant to voting on impeachment — and remained opposed to proceeding with formal articles of impeachment given the underwhelming evidence Republican investigators have gathered. But after White House special counsel Dick Sauber issued a Nov. 17 letter challenging the legitimacy of the inquiry and demanding that subpoenas and requests for interviews with Biden family members and White House aides be rescinded, GOP lawmakers rallied behind the idea of strengthening the House’s legal hand by moving to authorize the investigation with a vote.\n\nBefore the vote, at least one Republican remained skeptical of the GOP’s year-long investigation into Biden. Rep. Ken Buck (Colo.) told reporters Tuesday that he was still leaning toward voting against authorizing the inquiry. But while Buck said that he saw no link between the actions of Hunter and Joe Biden in Ukraine, he said he did not appreciate Sauber’s letter to Congress that indicated a defiant posture toward oversight efforts.\n\n“I don’t like what the White House did when they sent back a letter saying, you haven’t passed an impeachment inquiry so we aren’t going to give you these documents — I don’t think that’s based on the Constitution,” Buck reasoned. “But at the same time, I don’t see the link between the actions of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. I think there’s lots of reasons to fire Viktor Shokin in Ukraine, and I don’t think it was related to Hunter Biden — so I’m really torn.”\n\nHunter Biden “does not get to dictate the terms of the subpoena,” Comer told reporters outside an empty hearing room where the deposition was supposed to take place. Pressed about whether he has found evidence that the president had engaged in wrongdoing or criminal conduct, Comer said he had found “some very serious evidence,” before citing two examples of banking records he has repeatedly mischaracterized.",

  "text": "Donald Trump is the overwhelming polling leader for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, even as he faces four criminal indictments. But several GOP rivals are holding out hope for an upset through strong showings in the first states set to vote.\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Biden is seeking reelection and heavily favored to win, despite two lesser-known challengers. Independent or third-party candidates such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., are longshots but could sway a close general election matchup.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses kicked off the presidential nominating process on Jan. 15.\n\nRepublicans have rallied to the former president’s side as he faces growing legal peril – accused in court of falsifying business records, mishandling classified documents and unsuccessfully attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Some trials are scheduled to play out as GOP voters are still selecting their nominee -- though the proceedings could be delayed. Trump has used the criminal investigations to his political benefit in the primary, vowing “retribution” for his enemies and resurging from a moment of vulnerability after the 2022 midterms.\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who later served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, seized new attention this fall with her debate performances, and many Republicans now view her as the most viable alternative to Trump. She’s surged toward Trump in New Hampshire, where she’s running on a traditional Republican platform but has also enticed moderates and independents as she calls for a new, younger generation of leaders. But to many in the GOP she embodies an older incarnation of the party that Trump shattered.\n\nFormer Texas congressman Will Hurd ended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in October and endorsed Haley. He launched his campaign declaring that if Republicans nominate “a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump... we all know Joe Biden will win again.” The ex-CIA officer was known in Congress for his willingness to work with Democrats and is now making a longshot pitch for his more moderate brand of what he calls “common-sense leadership.\"\n\nMike Pence ended his campaign in October after struggling to gain traction among Republican voters – many of whom faulted him for defying Trump’s pressure to reject the results of the 2020 election. Pence served as vice president under Trump and embraced his agenda but broke with him on Jan. 6, 2021, refusing to interfere with the certification of Biden’s electoral win. He grew more critical of Trump during his presidential bid, suggesting his former running mate is unfit for office. But he still indicated he would back Trump if he wins the GOP nomination.\n\nBiden is seeking reelection, saying he wants to “finish the job” he started when the country was besieged by a deadly pandemic, a reeling economy and a teetering democracy. Polling shows that many Democrats would prefer a nominee other than Biden in 2024, and at 80 he is the oldest president in U. S. history to seek a second term. But major Democratic leaders have not taken steps to challenge him, and his party’s better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterms helped quiet critics.\n\n[How Democrats across the country feel about Biden 2024]\n\nRep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) announced a long-shot primary challenge to President Biden in 2024. While Phillips’s political views are broadly aligned with those of Biden, Phillips has for months called on Biden to allow another Democrat to lead the Democratic ticket in 2024. “I’m representing what I believe to be the majority of the country that wants to turn the page,” Phillips said recently on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Tired of the meanness and the fearmongering of Donald Trump. I would like to see Joe Biden, a wonderful and remarkable man, pass the torch, cement this extraordinary legacy.”\n\nActivist and self-help author Marianne Williamson is waging a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination. Williamson is positioning herself to Biden’s left, advocating tuition-free higher education at public institutions, among other initiatives. She also ran for president in 2020, calling for “a moral and spiritual awakening” in the United States, and dropped out shortly before the first nominating contests. “We need to offer fundamental economic reform. Nothing short of that will beat the Republicans in 2024,” she told The Post in an interview.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a controversial member of the storied Kennedy family who is known for his anti-vaccine views, parlayed his famous last name into years of advocacy as an environmental lawyer and best-selling author. In recent years, however, he has become better-known as one of the country’s most prominent opponents of vaccines and peddled false claims linking them to autism. He gained even more notoriety during the pandemic while spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines.\n\nAzi Paybarah, Michael Scherer, Tyler Pager, Maeve Reston, Toluse Olorunnipa, Mariana Alfaro, Meryl Kornfield, Maegan Vazquez and John Wagner contributed to this report.

  "text": "BOSTON — President Biden said Tuesday he might not be seeking a second term if former president Donald Trump had not launched his own campaign for the White House.“If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running,” Biden said at a campaign fundraiser in the Boston area. “But we cannot let him win.”\n\nThe comments punctuated a stretch that has seen Biden speaking in increasingly stark terms about the threat he says a second Trump term would pose to American democracy. The remarks also come as Biden, who turned 81 last month, has tried to downplay concerns in the Democratic Party about his age.\n\nPolls have shown a tight race between Biden and Trump next year, an increasing source of angst for many Democrats. The Biden campaign has downplayed the polls, saying Biden will prevail once voters start focusing on the race in earnest, especially if Trump is the GOP nominee and Americans begin comparing the two nominees directly.\n\nIn the meantime, Biden has sought to frame Trump’s candidacy as an existential threat to the country. He has said Trump and what he calls “MAGA Republicans” are seeking to dismantle U. S. democracy and eliminate many of Americans’ fundamental rights.\n\nDuring fundraisers in the Boston area Tuesday, the president warned of the restrictions he said Trump would place on abortion, and he emphasized the former president’s vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBiden also again raised the fact that Trump has called his political enemies “vermin,” saying the comments echo the language used in Germany in the 1930s, a time when the Nazis rose to power.\n\n“I’ve been around in politics for a while, and I never thought I’d run in an election like this,” Biden said Tuesday of what is shaping up to be a rematch of the 2020 presidential election. “This time we’re running an election denier-in-chief. Trump’s not even hiding the ball anymore.”\n\nBiden also made light of his age during the fundraisers, as polls show many Democratic voters are deeply concerned about it.\n\nDuring his first fundraiser Tuesday, Biden noted that he got 81 million votes in the 2020 election and joked, “Almost like somebody’s age. It’s hell turning 40 twice.” The president made a similar joke at a second fundraiser.\n\nBiden’s candidacy has faced fresh questions in recent weeks as polls show that young voters — a group that was critical to his 2020 victory — disapprove of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Some Muslim American and Arab groups have also begun urging their communities not to support Biden in 2024. While Muslims and Arabs are not a large voter group, their votes could tip the scales in tightly contested states such as Michigan, which has a growing Arab American population.\n\nBiden at times on Tuesday took an incredulous tone as he described Trump’s actions and comments. He noted that Trump, who continues to falsely deny that he lost the 2020 election, did not attend Biden’s inauguration, saying Trump was the first president to skip the inauguration of his successor.\n\n“He didn’t even show up at my inauguration,” Biden said. “I can’t say I was disappointed. But he didn’t show up.”\n\nBiden also signaled disbelief as he recounted Trump’s statement that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” He added, “What in God’s name is going on?”",

  "text": "The agreement aims to reestablish key military channels more than a year after Beijing severed them in a burst of anger over then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022. Biden and Xi also agreed to strengthen counternarcotics cooperation in the hopes of lessening the United States’ fentanyl crisis. Though modest in scope, the two agreements are a rare sign of cooperation between the world’s two most powerful countries, which have been at odds over trade, cyber- and maritime security, human rights, and a range of other pressing issues.\n\nDefusing a potential military showdown over Taiwan has become even more critical for a White House operating on limited bandwidth amid a ballooning war between Israel and Hamas and Russia’s grinding invasion of Ukraine. “There are only so many fires that we can be putting out around the world at once,” a White House official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the crush of geopolitical challenges the administration is facing.\n\nDespite numerous points of contention, both Biden and Xi have reason to try to thaw the relationship. Biden has long feared that a misstep could lead to an escalation that neither side wants, and U. S. officials stress the need for the two countries to have an open line of communication to guard against this eventuality.",

  "text": "“The only reason there is an abortion ban in America is because of Donald Trump,” Biden said at a campaign fundraiser. “The only reason teenagers in Ohio are being forced to travel out of state to get their health care is because of Donald Trump. The only reason a fundamental right has been stripped away from the American people for the first time in American history is because of Donald Trump.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has taken to mocking a purportedly befuddled Biden, theatrically looking around the stage at his events to mimic someone who cannot find his way out. “Think of it — we have a guy in the White House who can’t put two sentences together,” Trump said at a rally in New Hampshire. “Oh, he couldn’t find his way off this stage. And actually, he would be confused because I think my audience behind me might be bigger than [his] audiences.”\n\nFor now, Biden is holding few campaign rallies, so his anti-Trump volleys are largely confined to political fundraisers and statements from his campaign; allies are urging him to attack Trump even more vocally and more often. Trump, for his part, has been going after Biden for some time, but he appears to be devoting less energy to attacking his Republican rivals in favor of hammering the president.\n\nTheir decision to focus so sharply on each other reflects a belief by both campaigns that there is a diminishing chance that any other candidate will change the trajectory of the race. With two months until the first nominating contest in Iowa, Trump leads the other Republican candidates by more than 40 points in most national polls, while Biden’s primary challengers have little public name recognition and lack the official support of the Democratic Party.\n\nAt 77 and 80, respectively, Trump and Biden are old enough that potential health crises pose a threat, Mair said, and their campaigns could be caught flat-footed if either is forced out of the race. She said both campaigns should be compiling opposition research they may need to run against replacement nominees, adding, “I just think this is infinitely more unpredictable than any presidential race I’ve ever seen.”\n\nSigns have been accumulating for months that the Biden and Trump campaigns are training their focus on each other. In September, they staged dueling visits to autoworkers in Michigan as Trump spurned his GOP competitors by skipping the second primary debate. Biden warned in a speech that month that Trump, who sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, sees no limits on his power should he regain the White House.\n\nOn social media, Biden’s campaign now frequently mocks Trump and points out his verbal gaffes, while Trump derides Biden and blames him for the decision of federal and state authorities to file numerous criminal charges against him. The Biden campaign has been sending out emails warning about “Trump’s America in 2025,” while Trump’s team blasted out a New York Times poll showing the former president leading Biden in five swing states. At rallies, Trump imitates Biden tripping while walking up stairs.\n\nBiden’s team is working hard to frame the election as a choice between him and Trump, who is anathema to large parts of the electorate, rather than as a referendum on Biden’s presidency. “There are a lot of issues that are not binary — but in 2024, in this election, it is binary,” Vice President Harris said at a recent campaign event. “It is binary, and the choice is clear.”\n\nMany voters who are dissatisfied with Biden’s actions on a given issue, like the economy or abortion rights, nonetheless prefer him to Trump on those subjects, said Democratic pollster Nancy Zdunkewicz. Establishing that comparison now is especially important for Biden, she said, because Trump’s court cases may distract from other topics next year. (Trump has denied wrongdoing in each of those cases and has said he is being targeted for political reasons.)",

In less than an hour, the video had a million views and it ultimately racked up more than 38 million, becoming Mac’s most-watched post.\n\n“Our communications strategy is ‘all of the above’ — which it must be to break through in a fractured media environment and an era of information overload,” LaBolt said. “We study where Americans get their information and make sure we are meeting them where they are, whether that is traditional newscasts, social media or consumer outlets.”\n\nCBS’s “60 Minutes” also scored exclusive time with the president at last year’s Detroit Auto Show, and correspondent Scott Pelley used it to press Biden on such issues as how he would hold down gas prices amid the Ukraine war. Roughly 10 million people watched the “60 Minutes” segment live, a smaller viewership than four NFL games airing at the same time, according to data collected by the Nielsen company. This past Sunday, “60 Minutes” aired another interview with the president, offering his most direct answers yet to questions about the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nBiden is hardly the first president to turn to nontraditional sources to reach a different audience. Clinton appeared on an MTV town hall in 1994 (where he was asked if he wore boxers or briefs). President Barack Obama appeared on the comedy show “Between Two Ferns” in 2014 (where he was asked, “How does it feel to be the last Black president?”)\n\nMac said Biden’s burgeoning relationship with TikTokers shows that he is looking to engage with a younger audience, one that is unlikely to turn to traditional sources for its news. He doesn’t see that changing; Mac is in talks with administration officials to record a “crib tour” of the East Wing.",

  "text": "He said “the chances are real” that the truce could be extended by a few more days. He added that he expected American hostages to soon be released. And he proclaimed that Hamas “doesn’t give a damn” about Palestinians caught in the conflict, adding, “I don’t trust Hamas to do anything right. I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure.”\n\nThe successful start of the temporary pause and the hostage relief plan, though, came as welcome news for an administration that was central to helping bring it all about. Biden’s agenda has been consumed by the conflict since the Hamas invasion of Israel on Oct. 7, with numerous calls, a trip to Israel and a tricky tightrope walk navigating diplomacy in one of the thorniest regions in the world.\n\nHe’s been under unrelenting pressure over Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza, especially from the political left in his own party.  The hostage release not only gives him a chance to declare victory on the hostages, it also provides a several-day respite in Israel’s onslaught — and the opportunity to say his early embrace of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is paying dividends.\n\nIn his remarks, he also prominently mentioned some of the Americans yet to be released, and acknowledged that he doesn’t know the conditions of all 10 Americans who are unaccounted for, including whether all are alive.\n\n“We also remember all those who are still being held, and renew our commitment to work for their release as well: Two American women and one 4-year-old child, Abigail, who remains among those missing,” he said. “We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their whereabouts.”\n\n“We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow and more on the day after and more on the day after that,” he said. “Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families.”\n\nHe invoked the U. S. Thanksgiving holiday — “We can also be thankful of families being … reunited with loved ones who have been held hostage for nearly 50 days” — and he mentioned the impact of some of the early images Friday.\n\n“I encourage the prime minister to focus on trying to reduce the number of casualties while he is attempting to eliminate Hamas, which is the legitimate objective,” he said. “That's a difficult task. And I don't know how long it will take. My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can.”\n\nHe has spent much of the holiday on the property where he is staying, which is owned by David Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder of the Carlyle Group private equity firm. On Wednesday, he called leaders of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt, trying to ensure that the deal remained in place.\n\n“As we look to the future, we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East,” he said Friday. “We need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side-by-side in a two-state solution with equal measure of freedom and dignity.”\n\nAfter his remarks Friday afternoon, he dipped into Brotherhood of Thieves, a family favorite restaurant, for a late lunch. As he swung into the nearby Nantucket Bookworks, he said he was doing some Christmas shopping: “Can’t come without going to the bookstore. We’ve got a tradition.” He emerged with a book — “Democracy Awakening” by Heather Cox Richardson — before continuing the holiday stroll.\n\nBut as the ceremony came to a conclusion, the president, and the crowd, was reminded of the turmoil taking place far from this idyllic island. A group of about 10 protesters, standing directly to the president’s left and in his line of sight, unveiled several signs that read, “Free Palestine” and “End Apartheid and Genocide.”\n\nOne of the protesters was Sarah Nabulsi, a 34-year-old who grew up in Nantucket and whose father is Palestinian. She said she realized that Biden has spent much of his political career bolstering a pro-Israeli record, but felt in this moment they needed to be heard.",

Joe Biden at the Wilmington train station platform on his regular commute from his home to work on Capitol Hill in July 2005. Biden campaigned as an Amtrak-riding “Middle-Class Joe” but also sought access to a highflying segment of Delaware society. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)GREENVILLE, Del. — In August 2001, leaders at the exclusive Fieldstone Golf Club voted to admit a prominent new member: Sen. Joe Biden. At the time, Biden walked a delicate line. On one hand, he campaigned as an Amtrak-riding “Middle-Class Joe” striving to make ends meet, and accurately described himself as “one of the poorest members of Congress” — reporting $221,000 in combined income with his wife that year and $360 in charitable contributions.Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.Yet at the same time in Delaware, Biden had deep ties with one of the wealthiest families in his small home state: the du Pont clan, founders of the international chemical company headquartered in Wilmington. Biden had recruited top staffers from the firm, served in Congress alongside a du Pont, and even bought a mansion built by the family.Then came a new opportunity: a membership at the new golf club, which was founded by a du Pont heiress, which offered Biden access to a highflying part of Delaware society that otherwise may have been closed off to him — one that he’s continued enjoying to this day, with records showing he has visited Fieldstone at least 22 times as president, most recently playing a round and dining there in August.But his initial entry into the club in 2001 also later raised questions for federal investigators, who had spent years probing Fieldstone and its founder, Lisa Dean Moseley, over millions of dollars in loans she gave to a local official whose help she sought getting a permit at the new golf course.A firm controlled by Mosely had given Biden entrance to the club without the usual upfront partnership fee, according to minutes of the meeting obtained by The Washington Post, which could cost around $34,000. The minutes say her company transferred to him an “unused” ticket for entree, while noting he did have to pay membership dues and other fees.As a result, for about one month in 2007, the FBI investigated whether Biden, then a senator, had received a monetary benefit — and whether he should have disclosed that, according to two individuals with direct knowledge of the previously unreported inquiry, which went so far as to snap photos of Biden’s personal locker at the club. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an investigation. It was closed without surfacing allegations of wrongdoing by either Biden or Moseley, who died in 2016.This previously untold story behind the investigation casts new light on how Biden has navigated his twin personas — as a penny pinching politico in a Congress full of multimillionaires, and as a striving Delawarean who spent much of his life viewing the du Ponts as privileged lodestars.For someone raised in Delaware with Biden’s blue-collar background, “it would be quite an accomplishment” to rise into the same social circles as the du Ponts, said Joseph Hurley, a Wilmington attorney who grew up with Biden and represented Moseley.“It’s like, ‘I’ve really arrived,’ because the du Ponts were the family, the king’s-family type thing,” he said.It’s unclear if Biden was ever informed about the FBI investigation, which launched amid a crucial period in his career, around the time he declared a run for president — an effort that evolved into vetting by Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign before his selection as vice-presidential nominee. Biden was also reelected to the Senate the next year, enabling another Democrat to take his seat when he and Obama won the White House. Voters did not learn about the inquiry, which was never made public.The White House declined to respond directly to questions about the matter. Instead, a spokesman wrote via email: “These bizarre suggestions from more than 20 years ago are confusing given the fact that the Post is reporting that President Biden was fully responsible for membership dues at the golf club and all out-of-pocket costs associated with it. Frankly, the Post’s own reporting suggests this supposed matter was closed 15 years ago with no finding of wrongdoing. If you want to dig deep on who’s funding a president’s golf habits, we might have some suggestions.”The golf course access at the heart of the 16-year-old probe pales in comparison to the growing list of federal and state charges facing former president Donald Trump — Biden’s leading Republican challenger — including civil charges in New York in part over his valuation of his golf clubs and other properties.The White House declined to disclose whether Biden ever purchased a membership partnership at the club in 2001, the period that was investigated. Separately, a White House official did not respond to questions about whether Biden today pays annual dues at Fieldstone Golf Club.Biden has long cited the role of the du Pont family and company in Delaware in his family story. As he wrote in his memoir “Promises to Keep,” his father moved the family from Scranton, Pa., to a suburb of Wilmington, which he saw as more economically stable due to the presence of so many well-paid DuPont employees. “DuPont meant security for today and better times for the future,” Biden wrote.By the time Biden was considering his own career, he later wrote, he decided to pass up the possibility of a typical DuPont “job for life” and aim for a position with more financial upside. (Many members of the du Pont family style their names differently than DuPont, the firm.)“I’m taking the risk,” Biden wrote, as he opted for law school and a life in politics.Years later, Biden recalled that his mother urged him to value his heritage with as much pride as the state’s best-known family. “Like I’m a du Pont or something,” Biden recalled. “You’re a Biden. Nobody is better than you, and everybody’s equal to you,” his mother told him.Still, he envied the position and power of those who founded the DuPont company.Elected to the Senate in 1972, he served in Congress alongside Rep. Pierre “Pete” du Pont IV, who later became Delaware’s governor and ran for president. Biden’s close adviser and Senate chief of staff, Ted Kaufman, had worked for DuPont as a plastics engineer.In 1974, Biden spent $185,000 to buy what he called a “gorgeous ... enormous” mansion built six decades earlier by a du Pont family member in Greenville, Del. The home, which he named “the Station,” served as a base for Biden’s unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign; he sold it for $1.2 million in 1996 and then bought a four-acre lakefront property in Greenville.That is the same town near Wilmington where Lisa Dean Moseley, the great-great-great-granddaughter of the DuPont company founder, had her estate called Serendip.While Trump is better known as a golfer and owner of golf courses, Biden, too, is an aficionado of the game — and as it happened, Moseley was planning to develop some of her property in Greenville into an exclusive club to be known as Fieldstone.For that, she needed approval from New Castle County.In the process of getting it, Moseley gave a $2.3 million loan to a close friend, Sherry Freebery — who was New Castle County’s chief administrative officer, according to court records. Moseley appealed to Freebery for help, including sending her a message that said, “SOS. Please call asap — need help with Fieldstone,” according to the records.As the FBI investigated that loan, Moseley’s family made national headlines when her third husband was arrested at the 1998 golf course opening on charges of arranging a murder, which he later confessed to. That same year, federal authorities charged Freebery and another local official on racketeering and other charges, which they denied. In 2007, most of the charges were dropped; Freebery pleaded guilty to the omission of the loan on a mortgage application, a felony, and was sentenced to a year of probation and a $350 fine. She declined to comment on the case.As a result of the local corruption investigation, the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office in Wilmington had developed a steady flow of tips related to the golf club and local politicians, according to two individuals familiar with the matter.Among them was one the FBI decided warranted further investigation: the circumstances under which Biden had received access to Fieldstone.The management meeting of Fieldstone’s top officers came to order on Aug. 28, 2001. The fourth item on the agenda was Biden’s application to become a member, according to a copy of meeting minutes obtained by The Post.“New Member Application: The management team reviewed and approved the application of Senator Joseph Biden. For the balance of this calendar year, Senator Biden will play under an unused warrant held by Fife Hills LLC. He will be responsible for paying all dues and other charges incurred by his account.”Fife Hills was a company controlled by the club’s founder, Moseley. Fieldstone was established as a partnership, meaning each member first paid a fee to join the club and obtain a “warrant,” which in effect carries the ability to be a member. Then they paid additional annual dues to maintain their membership.People who paid to became partners were allowed to give their warrant to another golfer, a person familiar with the matter said, so warrants technically did not have a cost. An article in 1998 in the Delaware News Journal, shortly before Biden became a member, said partnerships cost $30,000. A lawsuit filed in 2004 revealed that Fieldstone had 291 partners, who had paid $34,000 apiece.The minutes do not say that Biden became a partner but specified he had to pay membership dues and other fees, which typically would be a reference to items such as food charges. They also don’t say if Moseley herself directed that the membership warrant be given to Biden, or if the two knew each other. Nor do they indicate whether Biden continued being a member under this arrangement in the following years — and a White House official declined to explain.Hurley said he doesn’t know if Biden and Moseley knew each other, nor any information about Biden’s golf club membership. But, speaking generally, he said the arrangement could have served the interest of both the heiress, who wanted proximity to powerful people, and the senator, who valued support from the du Pont family and its workers.“People who are in Lisa’s position with a lot of money, as a general rule, like to ingratiate themselves to people who are in positions of power,” Hurley said. “Lisa was the type of person that had to have her way … and to be able to say a United States senator from Delaware is a friend of mine is something important to a person such as herself.”Freebery, who was one of Moseley’s closest friends, said that she has no recollection of Moseley mentioning anything about meeting with Biden or the membership. “To my knowledge there was no friendship or social interaction,” Freebery said.Another former associate of Moseley recalled her mentioning that Biden was a member of the golf club but did not know if she knew Biden.Since many new members purchased a partnership to gain entree to the club membership, the FBI wanted to examine whether Biden had received something of value from Moseley or her LLC that he had not reported on his financial disclosure form, according to individuals familiar with the matter.By the standards of a typical U.S. senator, Biden was not wealthy and it might have been a stretch for him to buy a club partnership, given the costs of maintaining his home and other obligations. In the jointly filed 2001 tax return on which he and his wife reported an income of $221,000, the Bidens reported deducting $38,753 for their home mortgage. They regularly gave modest charitable donations, including $360 in 2000 and $260 in 2002, according to the tax returns.It is not clear how much Biden would have paid in annual dues at the club; Fieldstone has not said what it charged for membership dues.The FBI launched the investigation by writing an “opening communication,” a standard document describing the scope of the inquiry and the potential offenses that justified it, according to the people familiar with the matter. In addition, opening a probe into a sitting U.S. senator required an extra level of approval, with vetting by officials in Wilmington, Baltimore and Washington, according to an individual familiar with the matter.Investigators went to Fieldstone and verified that Biden was a member by taking a picture of his locker, according to an individual familiar with the matter.Typically, the local U.S. attorney would have worked in concert with the FBI.But Delaware’s U.S. attorney, Republican Colm Connolly, recused himself and his office because he was being vetted for the nomination for a federal judgeship — a post over which Biden would have outsize say as the home-state member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, two former federal officials with direct knowledge of his decision said. That recusal has not been previously reported.At the time of Connolly’s nomination, his top assistant was David C. Weiss, who is now Delaware’s U.S. attorney and special counsel handling the investigation and prosecution of Hunter Biden. An individual familiar with the matter said that Weiss would have known that Connolly had recused himself and the office over a Biden matter, although it is not clear if Weiss knew the precise circumstances.Several weeks after the FBI began its inquiry, and after Connolly recused himself, the Justice Department closed the investigation. It is not clear whether the records in the Biden case still exist. In general, a Justice Department official said, the policy is that if an investigation does not result in prosecution, the case file typically is destroyed three to ten years after an investigation is closed. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment about the case.Connolly, whose nomination lapsed after the end of the George W. Bush administration, has since been successfully nominated to the federal judgeship by Trump. Connolly declined to comment.Don Fox, the former acting director of the Office of Government Ethics in the Obama administration, said in an interview that the transaction could have been considered “a thing of value” that “should have been reported.” He said in similar cases, he advised government officials to disclose golf memberships. When he was deputy general counsel of the Air Force, a post he held from 1998 to 2008, Fox said he advised generals who accepted a waiver of initiation fees at golf courses that the arrangement was unacceptable, and he said that he viewed Biden’s acceptance of the warrant as the equivalent of an initiation fee.Nonetheless, Fox said that even if officials had determined that Biden should have reported the warrant, he did not think that the Justice Department would have found it worthy of further investigation unless they believed that Biden had done something in exchange for the warrant.Biden has now achieved something no du Pont ever accomplished: being elected to the White House. Still, the connection remains to a facility created by a du Pont family member. He has been a regular at Fieldstone Golf Club during his presidency, sometimes dining at the clubhouse after he plays, according to the accounts of journalists who track his movements.On a recent trip to the club, Biden arrived at the club at 2:06 p.m. on Aug. 6, when the press bus was separated from his motorcade. The White House informed the press that “the president is golfing with family” and others. Then, at 5:02 p.m., the press rejoined the entourage and witnessed Biden being taken back to his home, where they were informed he would spend the evening.But two hours later came a change in plans: Biden headed back to Fieldstone Golf Club for dinner.Alice Crites and Magda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.Reporting and analysis from the Hill and the White HouseRNC Chair Ronna McDaniel confirms she is stepping down Biden supercharged these Michigan unions.

  "text": "After the Kansas City Chiefs shut down the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC championship game to book another trip to the Super Bowl, social media was buzzing about  Patrick Mahomes — specifically, where he ranks all-time among quarterbacks. It’s a legitimate question, even though he has played just seven years in the NFL and just six as a starter. What Mahomes has done in that short time — individually and with his team — absolutely places him in the conversation with the greats.\n\nMahomes, 28, will make his fourth Super Bowl start in Las Vegas, the most for any quarterback before age 30. He has 14 playoff wins, tied for the third most by any quarterback. (Only Tom Brady, with 35, and Joe Montana, with 16, have more.) He has led Kansas City to six straight AFC championship games and two Super Bowl titles, earning MVP honors in both wins. Mahomes also was the league MVP in 2018 and 2022. Only Brady and Montana have also won at least two Super Bowls while claiming two Super Bowl MVP trophies and two regular season MVP awards. Kansas City has a chance to become the ninth back-to-back Super Bowl champion in NFL history and the first since the New England Patriots in the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\nIt’s Brady, the quarterback of those Patriots teams, who stands in the way of Mahomes being considered the greatest quarterback of all time. But after digging a bit deeper into their careers, it should be clear that Mahomes’s case can’t be easily dismissed.\n\nFor example, Mahomes has clearly been a better passer than Brady during the regular season to this point in his career. Comparing their first six seasons as starters, Mahomes averages more passing yards per game and has a higher completion rate, a higher passer rating and a lower sack rate than Brady. To be fair, Mahomes is playing during a time when teams are passing more often, but even after adjusting for that, Mahomes comes out well ahead of Brady. During the first six seasons Brady was a starter, the league-average passer rating was 80.1 and Brady’s rating was 88.4. Over the same period for Mahomes, his passer rating was 103.7 compared with a league average of 91.0. (Mahomes has the second-best career passer rating in NFL history, a fraction below that of Aaron Rodgers.)\n\nAny conversation about the best quarterback of all time must acknowledge Brady’s postseason success, which in many corners supersedes everything else. But that argument rests on longevity and accumulated excellence. In a game-by-game playoff comparison, Mahomes does just fine.\n\nDuring Brady’s first 17 playoff starts, his performance was worth an estimated five points more per game than would be expected based on the down, distance and field position of each play, per TruMedia. Mahomes was worth almost 10 more points per game than expected over his first 17 playoff starts, meaning he has been nearly twice as valuable as Brady during those first 17 playoff appearances despite both men compiling 14-3 records.\n\nWhere does the extra value come from? Mahomes threw just seven interceptions in his first 17 playoff starts compared with 12 for Brady. A whopping 39 percent of Mahomes’s playoff passing attempts converted first downs compared with 33 percent for Brady in his first 17 playoff games. Mahomes also had more touchdown passes in those games (39 vs. 26) and helped his receivers average significantly more yards after completions (5.8 vs. 1.9). The regular season shows a similar disparity during each player’s first 96 starts. Brady was worth four points more per game than expected in that span; Mahomes was worth nine points more per game than expected.\n\nThe bottom line is that, to the equivalent point in their careers, Mahomes has been more valuable than Brady. Perhaps you can’t place him ahead of Brady because we don’t know what the rest of his career will look like — Brady excelled well into his 40s — but everyone should at least be able to agree that Mahomes is already a Hall of Famer and deserves inclusion (along with Brady) on the Mount Rushmore of quarterbacks. The real debate is who joins them.\n\nMaybe Montana, who blossomed in Bill Walsh’s West Coast offense during the San Francisco 49ers’ dynasty. Though he didn’t have the strongest arm, Montana’s accuracy, mobility and ability to throw catchable balls made him exceptional. Montana’s clutch performances against tough NFC competition and his flawless Super Bowl record — the 49ers won all four Super Bowls he played in — contribute to his claim as one of the greatest quarterbacks. His postseason run from 1988 to 1990, with an eight-game stretch of recording a 100-plus passer rating — something no one has done before or since — solidifies his legendary status.\n\nPeyton Manning should also be considered. His impact extends beyond his numerous records and record five MVP trophies. He transformed quarterback play by taking control at the line of scrimmage, constantly adjusting plays to outwit his opponents. Two Super Bowl rings and clutch postseason play affirm his greatness, with his 2004 campaign standing out as the all-time best. He threw for 4,557 yards and broke Dan Marino’s record of 48 touchdown passes with 49 in 15 games.\n\nFinally, Johnny Unitas revolutionized the position, introducing the two-minute drill and precision passing. He led the Baltimore Colts to three championships and earned three MVP awards. He remains the only player to lead the NFL in passing touchdowns for four consecutive seasons.\n\nOther names commonly mentioned in such discussions include Marino, Rodgers, Roger Staubach and John Elway. All played far longer than Mahomes has, as did Montana, Manning and Unitas. But the body of work the Chiefs star has compiled over the past six seasons demands his inclusion in any conversation about the greatest quarterbacks of all time.",

  "text": "TEMPE, Ariz. — President Biden on Thursday sharply rebuked former president Donald Trump and his supporters for continued attempts to undermine American democracy, delivering one of his most explicit warnings that Trump poses a threat to democratic principles and institutions. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.In a marked shift, Biden hit Trump head-on, disposing of his usual pattern of oblique references to his predecessor, who holds a wide lead in the Republican primary to face Biden in next year’s presidential election. Biden called Trump out by name before detailing what he described as his anti-democratic behavior: relentless attacks on the press, praise for the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attackers, plans to consolidate power in the executive branch and a desire to fire civil servants who are not sufficiently loyal to him.\n\n“There’s something dangerous happening in America now,” Biden said. “There’s an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs in our democracy.” He added, “We should all remember: Democracies don’t have to die at the end of a rifle. They can die when people are silent, when they fail to stand up or condemn the threats to democracy.”\n\nAs part of the speech, Biden also announced plans to use federal funds to help construct the McCain Library, embracing the legacy of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to argue that democracy is not a partisan issue. Biden, who lauded McCain’s willingness to buck party orthodoxy on major issues, held up the former senator as a counter-example to Trump and other Republicans, whom he criticized for their “deafening” silence on the former president’s continued threats to democracy.\n\n“Trump says the Constitution gave him the right to do whatever he wants as president,” Biden said. “I’ve never even heard a president say that in jest. Not guided by the Constitution or by common service and decency toward our fellow Americans, but by vengeance and vindictiveness.”\n\nIn posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Trump campaign argued that Biden is the true enemy of American institutions because his party is trying to silence free speech. “The Radical Left Democrats, now led by Joe Biden, are the greatest threat to democracy the United States of America has ever faced,” the posts said. “Biden’s claims that conservatives are a ‘threat to democracy’ are nothing but projection.”\n\nAs a candidate for president in 2020, Biden centered democracy in his campaign pitch, castigating Trump as a unique threat to the American experience. Since taking office, he has tried to use the bully pulpit to remind Americans of the ongoing threats to democracy in the United States and rally citizens to protect it.\n\nBiden’s first major address on democracy came on the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection, when Biden spoke from the U. S. Capitol. In that speech, Biden did not mention Trump by name but made 16 references to the “former president,” whom he squarely blamed for undermining America’s democracy.\n\nHe then traveled to Philadelphia’s Independence Hall and more directly took on Trump, saying he and his followers “represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.” It was a remarkable assertion from a sitting U. S. president to pinpoint his predecessor and his followers as a grave threat to the stability of the 246-year American experiment.\n\nCindy McCain, the senator’s widow who served as Biden’s ambassador to the U. N. agencies for food and agriculture, introduced Biden on Thursday, thanking the president for honoring her late husband and the causes he had championed. McCain’s endorsement of Biden in 2020 was seen as a pivotal boost that helped him become the first Democrat to win Arizona since 1996.\n\n“John would have hated we’ve made this occasion just about him, but instead, he would have wanted to make it about what is most important,” Cindy McCain said. “John’s constant mantra [was] of service to a cause greater than one’s self interest, and this will be embodied here within this project for nurturing the flame of democracy.”\n\nIn 2019, a year after the senator’s death, Cindy McCain spoke of her desire to build a library in the senator’s honor, adding that it was not clear what the funding sources for the project would be. Biden’s announcement on Thursday answered that question, and White House officials said the new library will provide education, work and health-monitoring programs to underserved communities in the state.\n\nJack, who has both of his father’s flight jackets from his days in the U. S. Navy — one with a patch from when he was a lieutenant and another that has a squadron patch — said he would like the library to exhibit one of them. “It was an iconic piece of his political identity,” he said.\n\nBiden and McCain served together in the Senate for more than two decades, developing an unusually close relationship and in retrospect coming to represent a period of greater comity among figures from different parties. McCain requested that Biden speak at his funeral in August 2018, while his family made it clear they wanted Trump, who was then the sitting president, to stay away. “All politics is personal — it’s all about trust,” Biden said in the eulogy. “And I trusted John with my life.”",

  "text": "For months, the president and first lady Jill Biden have told aides and friends they are frustrated by the president’s low approval rating and the polls that show him trailing former president Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination — and in recent weeks, they have grown upset that they are not making more progress.\n\nSince that November meeting, which has not been previously reported, most polls continue to show Biden trailing Trump nationally and, more importantly, in key battleground states. The accumulation of troubling polls for Biden has made it harder for Democrats to dismiss them, leading to a fresh set of conversations among Biden officials and allies about whether the president and his team need a shift in strategy. And now Democrats in competitive races are growing increasingly worried about Biden damaging their own electoral prospects.\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who is running for the state’s open Senate seat, has expressed concern to allies that she may not be able to win her race if Biden is at the top of the ticket, according to people familiar with the conversations. A spokesman for Slotkin’s campaign said she “looks forward to running with President Biden.”\n\n“As Congresswoman Slotkin has often said, Michiganders care about results, and no one can argue with the results we see in Michigan: dirt is moving and plants are being built and expanded because of Democrats’ legislative accomplishments under President Biden, including the CHIPS Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” Austin Cook, the spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nAdding to the challenging political landscape, Biden’s agenda hangs in the balance on Capitol Hill as his pleas to provide more aid to Ukraine and Israel are mired in partisan battles after the visit from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to secure a breakthrough. House Republicans also formalized their impeachment inquiry into the president last week, despite not yet presenting evidence that Biden benefited from his son’s overseas business dealings.\n\nBiden officials have grown accustomed to Democratic anxiety about their every move and the state of their campaign. They routinely point to comments made by lawmakers, donors and pundits who declared Biden’s 2020 primary campaign over when he was routed in Iowa and New Hampshire before he went on to win the nomination and the presidency.\n\nIn the states, recent polls from CNN found Biden trailed Trump in Michigan by 10 points and in Georgia by 5 points. In early November, New York Times-Siena College polls found Biden trailing Trump in five of the six most competitive battleground states: Trump led Biden by 10 percentage points in Nevada, six in Georgia, five in Arizona and Michigan and four in Pennsylvania. Biden led Trump by two in Wisconsin, albeit well within the 4.8-point margin of error. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump in all six of those states, though by very narrow margins.\n\nPublicly, Biden campaign officials and Democratic allies have downplayed the polls, telling supporters to largely ignore them. They argue the election is still almost a year away and polls are not predictive of the results, but rather a snapshot of the current moment. They say most voters are not paying attention to the election yet, and the polls will change once the race becomes a clear choice between Biden and Trump.\n\nOnly recently, though, have Biden officials started to scale up the campaign, which they launched in April, after months of warnings from top Democrats in battleground states that they were too slow to build out their operation. Since Thanksgiving, the campaign has announced leadership teams in Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and South Carolina and more staffers are slated to be announced before the end of the year, campaign officials said.\n\n“The Republican primary could end quickly, and the general election could begin in weeks, not months,” said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist. “Given Trump’s noisiness and his ability to bully his way through the daily information wars, I think it’s really important that the Biden campaign move into general election mode as soon as possible. We’re not where we want to be. Some of our coalition is wandering and we need to go get them back.”\n\n“We are methodically and strategically building the infrastructure we’ll need to activate the broad and diverse coalition of voters that sent Joe Biden and Kamala D. Harris to the White House, and are confident that the full campaign apparatus that builds off three years of significant investments at the DNC will be a powerful force to defeat whatever MAGA Republican we face next year,” TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement.\n\nOver a 36-hour period this month, the Biden campaign raised over $15 million in Southern California alone, the people said. The massive haul came after Democratic candidates, including Biden, had stayed away from fundraising in Los Angeles because of the nearly four month actors strike, which ended in early November. While in California, both the president and first lady attended star-studded fundraisers, with Lenny Kravitz performing at one with the president and Chrissy Teigen and Kerry Washington hosting an event for the first lady, with a guest list that included actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus.",

  "text": "Biden and former president Donald Trump appear headed for a rematch of their 2020 contest, although more than 3 in 5 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they would prefer a nominee other than the president. But Biden’s advisers have argued that he is the strongest Democrat for 2024 and those who wish for someone else share no consensus on who that should be, with 8 percent naming Vice President Harris, 8 percent naming Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and 20 percent saying they prefer “just someone else.”\n\nIn his bid to become the Republican presidential nominee for a third time, Trump is in a strong position nationally despite facing multiple criminal charges. He is favored by 54 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, little changed from 51 percent in May. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is second at 15 percent, down from 25 percent in May. No other Republican reaches double digits. Trump also leads his GOP rivals in recent state polls, which are likely to be more reliable indicators than national polls of the shape of the GOP race in the coming months.\n\nTrump faces 91 felony counts in four jurisdictions, including two cases in which he has been indicted on charges of attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Asked whether the former president is being held accountable under the law like anyone else would be or unfairly victimized by his political opponents, 53 percent of Americans say he is being held accountable like others and 40 percent say he is being unfairly victimized. Three-quarters of Republicans say the latter.\n\nThree in 4 also have a negative perception of the state of the average American’s income. Asked whether they are better off financially than when Biden took office, not as well off or in about the same shape, 44 percent say not as well off, compared with 15 percent who say better off and 39 percent who say about the same.\n\nSince the start of the war in February 2022, public opinion has shifted away from supporting the Ukrainians. The current survey finds 41 percent saying the United States is doing too much to help, 31 percent saying it is the right amount and 18 percent saying it is too little. In February, 33 percent said they thought levels of assistance were too much while in April 2022, 14 percent held that view.\n\nAnother group that backs Trump by a big margin in the poll are those who say they did not vote in 2020. They account for about 15 percent of the overall sample of registered voters, and they favor Trump over Biden by 63 percent to 27 percent. That level of support is significantly stronger than among those in the poll who say they voted in 2020. Among that group, Trump is at 50 percent, Biden at 45 percent.\n\nThe Constitution prohibits someone who has taken an oath to defend the Constitution from holding office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. There are some legal experts who say this should disqualify Trump because of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol. Americans are roughly divided on this, with 44 percent saying he should be prohibited from holding office again and 50 percent saying he should not be prohibited.",

  "text": "LAS VEGAS — The last time the Kansas City Chiefs lost a game, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid engaged in a physical confrontation more intense than the Super Bowl bump seen around the world. It wasn’t as shocking, however, because the 65-year-old coach was the aggressor. During a Christmas Day home game against the Las Vegas Raiders, the Chiefs were such a desperate sloppy mess on offense that Reid called a fake punt play that didn’t involve Kelce. It actually worked. Punter Tommy Townsend threw a pass to the sideline for the first down. But Kelce was frustrated. He slammed his helmet to the Arrowhead Stadium turf. A staffer picked it up and went to take it back to Kelce, but as he lifted it in the air to alert the superstar tight end, Reid swatted it from his hand like a skilled shot-blocker. Then the coach walked over to a helmetless Kelce, scolded the player and ended the conflict by thrusting his right shoulder into Kelce’s left side. Unlike Sunday night, Kelce was the one who lost balance. Reid stormed away, and Patrick Mahomes tapped Kelce on the stomach to settle him.\n\nThe Chiefs went on to lose for the fourth time in six games, their most prolonged slump during this era of trophy hoarding. And Kelce-Reid I was just the most heated skirmish of a tumultuous holiday in which Mahomes humiliated his offensive line during a screaming sideline fit. The next day, many wondered whether all the feuding confirmed that they were, finally, broken.\n\n“He caught me off balance,” Reid said, intimating that slow-motion replays of the incident made it look worse than it felt. “I wasn’t watching. He was really coming over [to tell me]: ‘Just put me in, I’ll score. I’ll score.’ So that’s really what it was. I love that. It’s not the first time. I appreciate him.”\n\nIn the aftermath of a 25-22 overtime triumph that made even neutral hearts pound, Kansas City couldn’t simply celebrate a dynasty-affirming victory over the San Francisco 49ers. The conversation couldn’t end with a contemplation of the greatness of Patrick Mahomes, whose unlimited talent gains substance and nuance each season. Praise of the Chiefs’ stellar defense and magnificent roster management had to wait. And Kelce’s romance with Taylor Swift, a relationship made in pop-culture heaven, now came with a sidebar.\n\nMeanwhile, in our sadistically divided nation, the rest of America handled it quite unwell. Everyone is looking for their own disgusted view of the country in everything, and our grandest annual sporting event provided the perfect grievance canvas. If Kelce were Black, would the thug accusations be louder? If he weren’t a coronavirus vaccine endorser, would the crowd that does its own research scrutinize him so heavily? Somehow, a football player’s rage became as much a politically divisive issue as a societal concern about anger management.\n\nKelce was the first to do wrong, and when you get caught raging at the Super Bowl, it becomes more than a fairly typical football argument. It’s important to have a deep conversation about tempers and inappropriate, cartoonish masculine behavior. But this incident is not the Swiss army knife to carve out any greater point.\n\nSome of the extreme indignation has been akin to the wrath Kelce displayed Sunday. However, Kelce stepped back, collected himself, played his best football in the second half and helped his team win a third championship in five seasons. And Reid saw the bigger picture. He’s a coach who looks beyond flaws and enjoys managing complicated relationships. He often gets the best out of his players by embracing them as individuals without barking for them to conform.\n\nTragedy has taught him to connect in this way. He’s a father who has experienced the heartbreak of addiction with two of his sons. His oldest, Garrett, died of an overdose 12 years ago. Another son, Britt, was sentenced to three years in prison in 2022 for driving while intoxicated and injuring a 5-year-old girl. Time and pain have transformed Reid into a man who coaches like a father who yearns to keep improving his leadership.\n\n“He’s one of the best leaders of men I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelce said. “And he’s helped me a lot with that, with channeling that emotion, with channeling that passion. I owe my entire career to that guy and being able to kind of control how emotional I get. I just love him.”\n\nReid and Kelce have been together since 2013, forming one of the strongest head coach-star player relationships in the NFL. In college at Cincinnati, Kelce failed a drug test for marijuana and served a suspension for the entire 2010 season. Reid, who epitomizes tough love, has been a key figure in his maturation into a transcendent player who, at 34, projects to have a successful life after football, even if his relationship with Swift doesn’t last.\n\n“I’m someone who did some things, who might have been considered a loose cannon early in my career,” Kelce told me four years ago, reflecting before his first Super Bowl. “This organization does an unbelievable job of helping guys find who they are as a professional and as people, and we learn how to conduct ourselves with that.”\n\nStill, he stumbles. Or, in this case, he made Reid stumble. In football, there’s often an overzealous need to promote a violent game’s virtue. Listen enough to the waxing about the teamwork, discipline and attention to detail that the sport demands and how it molds boys to men, and you start to forget it is also a vicious and debilitating game with a 100 percent injury rate.\n\nThey aren’t all madmen. But they play mad out of necessity. It’s inevitable that kind of fire will get uncontrollable on occasion. It happened Sunday, but it also happened six weeks before that. And in previous seasons, the wunderkind Mahomes has been caught screaming at Reid and barking almost nose to nose with Eric Bieniemy, his fiery former offensive coordinator.\n\nBut this is a dynasty that can absorb confrontation, that can rise above the ugly side of football. It says something about the character of the Chiefs that they can show their worst and still find a pathway back to being their best.\n\nThe cameras didn’t catch Kelce apologizing and embracing Reid shortly after the incident. But onstage for the Lombardi Trophy presentation, you could see the love that both men spoke about afterward. Kelce hugged Reid from behind. The coach didn’t stumble this time. He didn’t ram his shoulder into the tight end, either. He reached back and tapped him to show his appreciation.",

  "text": "Though “Jaws” went on to win three Oscars, Spielberg didn’t receive a best director nomination. He was confused that a record-breaking blockbuster failed to garner the undisputed critical acclaim befitting the first movie to surpass $100 million at the box office. In the acerbic way he said winner! to punctuate his dismay, you could almost hear the varying levels of success.\n\nSix years ago, they were a treat, unveiling a unicorn quarterback to operate an avant-garde offense, thrilling while thriving. Now, with a third Super Bowl victory in the past five seasons within reach, the team that began as an entertaining successor to the exhausting New England Patriots dynasty is also a tired ol’ giant. Their continued prosperity makes them a victim of public fatigue.\n\n“For some reason, everybody used to love us,” Kansas City defensive tackle Chris Jones said, answering a question from NFL Network’s Michael Robinson. “We used to be one of the most favorite teams. Now everybody’s like, ‘We’re ready for the Chiefs to lose.’ I don’t know why, what changed, what dramatic incidents happened to where everybody felt like we should lose now, but that’s okay. They can continue hatin’.”\n\nIn this climate of extreme celebrity overexposure, the Chiefs are aging faster than a Popsicle in a sauna. They seem old in modern fame years. It’s not really their fault. What are they supposed to do? Lose for the sake of parity? Should Patrick Mahomes have turned down that record $450 million contract and all those lucrative endorsement deals? Should Coach Andy Reid stop being funny in commercials? Should Travis Kelce dump Taylor Swift to appease manly men who don’t want to share football?\n\nYou want to know what’s worse than a championship hog? A champion by default. During long periods between dominant teams, the game often regresses to a stale kind of parity, which belies the assumption that variety is more riveting. Every so often, sports need standard-bearers that generate equal amounts of love and hate. Sports need code breakers to propel the game forward. It’s no surprise that as the Patriots’ two-decade run ended — one in which Bill Belichick’s defensive game-planning sorcery complemented Tom Brady’s deft quarterbacking brilliance to win six Super Bowls — it spawned appreciation of a long-developing era of offensive creativity.\n\nAlong with Father Time, it took innovation to yank the Patriots from their pedestal. That’s what a winner! does for a sport. They are the target. Just as important, they can handle being the target. Shoot for as long as you need to get good.\n\nMahomes is 28, the same age as Spielberg when “Jaws” was released. He will become the youngest quarterback to start four Super Bowls on Sunday. No quarterback under 30 had accomplished the feat. In six seasons as a starter, he has thrown for 28,424 yards and 219 touchdowns. His regular season record is 74-22. In the playoffs, his team is 14-3.\n\nIt seems as if he’s everywhere, talking with an unmistakable Texas accent and delivery Reid describes as “froggish.” As long-standing icons in multiple sports continue their inevitable retirement migration, Mahomes stands as the biggest, in-his-prime superstar in American sports. He burst into fame in the most spellbinding manner since Dan Marino, and by his second season running the show, he was a champion. In his third, he led the Chiefs back to the Super Bowl, only to be humbled by Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In his fifth, he became a two-time champion, outlasting the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII and engaging in an epic duel with quarterback Jalen Hurts. And here he is again, this time with a defense-centered team that has prospered as an underdog this postseason, vying for a third title that would vault his legend and Kansas City’s burgeoning legacy to stunning heights.\n\nMahomes didn’t ask to be compared to Brady. He didn’t ask for uncontrollable fawning over his elastic arm and playmaking audacity. He isn’t an egotist or clout chaser who needs to convince you, so early in his career, that he is the greatest quarterback of all time. But in our debate-show sports culture, the argument has begun anyway. It only makes it harder to be a winner!, this running tally of accomplishments intended to settle the frivolous discourse. But no one can win those debates, especially not Mahomes, who should be left alone to amaze in real time.\n\n“I mean, I’m not even close to halfway,” Mahomes said of chasing Brady’s seven championships. “If you ask me that question in, like, 15 years, I’ll see if I can get close to seven. But seven seems like a long ways away still.”\n\nWe binge ourselves on every marquee team now. There aren’t enough synonyms for unprecedented and best and greatest to satisfy that desire to glorify the present. And strong reactions go both ways. In this climate, it’s just as easy to exaggerate hatred and weariness about things that have barely begun.\n\nWe manage to be hotter and colder than ever, all in record time. And amid the noise of traditional media, social media and technology, celebrities are both accessible and unavoidable. Problems with all this ubiquity manifest in the agitation over everything from the Taylor-Travis romance to the fit Mahomes threw over a penalty at the end of a regular season loss.\n\n“I love what one of my mentors says,” said linebacker Drue Tranquill, who is in his first season with the Chiefs. “He says the praise of man is so fickle. It’s here today, gone tomorrow, up and down. And so it’s really important to stay grounded in the things that matter.”",

  "text": "As the clock was winding down in overtime, Romo explained that, with the Chiefs down by three points and inside the 5-yard line, time did not matter because the game would not end under postseason-only rules that were changed in 2022. If the clock reached zero, he noted, the game would just roll into a second OT period.\n\nIt was an important point about an unusual situation and a new postseason rule, but Romo kept talking and Nantz, the play-by-play man who has made a career of coming up with the right words at the right time, had no entry point for setting up the final play. As Patrick Mahomes was finding Mecole Hardman in the end zone for the game-winning touchdown, Nantz could say only, “First and goal, Mahomes flings it! It’s there! Hardman! Jackpot! Kansas City!”\n\nRomo chattered as Nantz made the call and, when Nantz finished, Romo went into analysis mode as CBS showed reaction shots. Rather than letting the images tell the story, Romo was focused on the game-winning play and Hardman’s return to the Chiefs after starting the season with the New York Jets.\n\n“This was the Andy Reid special we talked about he was saving all day,” Romo said. “He’s going to fake a motion to go across. And at that moment he turns and goes back — Hardman, who they didn’t have, right? And they go get Hardman and bring him back. And the game-winning drive of Mahomes’s career, he’s been waiting for. He’s won Super Bowls, but he’s never had it in an overtime. He is the best. He is the standard — the Michael Jordan.”\n\nThat touchdown wasn’t the only less-than-seamless moment for Nantz and Romo, who together haul in around $30 million per year. In the first half, they missed the moment when tight end Travis Kelce accosted his 65-year-old coach, Andy Reid, on the sideline.\n\nKelce was angry at being replaced by Noah Gray on a red-zone play that ended in disaster when Gray struggled as he helped with blocking and running back Isiah Pacheco lost a fumble. CBS cut to a commercial and caught up with the incident when the broadcast resumed.\n\n“He goes, ‘Keep me in,’ ” Romo said by way of analysis. “What happened is, on the fumble, he was not in the game. Noah Gray went in, and he had to block. Noah Gray, the tight end, had to block [Deommodore] Lenoir. Lenoir made him swim and actually created the fumble. And I think Kelce is like, ‘Just keep me in there, even if we are running the ball.’ ”\n\nRomo had music on his mind several times, singing Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep,” trying to get Nantz to join him on “Viva Las Vegas” and doing a brief “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party).”\n\nHe and Nantz had to adjust when the game turned from a defensive struggle to offensive marches and Kansas City gave them plenty of material. The Chiefs rallied from a 10-point deficit — the third time Mahomes has done so in a Super Bowl — and forced overtime by outscoring the 49ers 16-9 in the third and fourth quarters. The Chiefs scored on their final four possessions.\n\nIn the week leading up to Super Bowl LVIII, Romo acknowledged that things are rockier now. Asked by a reporter how he deals with a more critical evaluation of his work, he answered: “I was the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. This is small potatoes.”\n\nNantz gently came to Romo’s defense, saying, “We’re all going to end up on the short end of the stick sometimes.” But in an interview with The Washington Post last year, he was more defensive. “Reporters with nothing else to write have agendas and are looking for clicks and attention.”\n\nThe situation Sunday night was not new for Nantz and Romo, who were in this territory when they called the Buffalo-Kansas City AFC divisional-round game two years ago. In that game, the Chiefs won the coin toss and scored on the opening possession of overtime. The Bills never got the ball, and the NFL changed the playoff rule just months later.\n\n“You keep resetting for the audience, but other than that, you’re lost in a bubble,” Nantz told the Associated Press. “In terms of just the concentration and the focus level, it’s why you do so many games. During the season, you have a routine and a team that’s working in concert together. I’m proud of our team. Sure, there was excitement, but you try to have the perfect tone and also try not to get in the way because the pictures and the visuals were telling a pretty full story on its own.”",

  "text": "How do you steal the show when you are the show? That was the unprecedented pop culture riddle that Usher found himself stepping into during halftime at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas on Sunday, the resurgent R&B superstar performing for the biggest audience of his platinum-selling life, yet still trying to draw our collective focus away from the centripetal human attention vortex sitting up in the skyboxes, one Taylor Swift.\n\nIt should hurt your brain to be reminded that Swift’s relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has only lasted five short months considering all the ways in which this omni-romance seems to have damaged everyone else’s — especially the tiny, desiccated brains of right-wing media personalities who believe that a bland crossing of celebrity stars is, in fact, a sinister plot hatched deep inside the Pentagon. For Usher, the perversity of the circumstances transformed his halftime task into something beyond formidable. Without appearing to affirm the whiny grunting of assorted high-profile MAGA zombies, he needed to make society forget that he was the second most famous singer in the building.\n\nSo he did it by confirming he was the best, his voice seemingly made out of elastic, silk, smoke and sunshine. You had to listen for it, though. This halftime show was a blitz of retinal maximalism with a meticulous protagonist at its center, singing and dancing with exactitude and purpose, working hard to cram more than a dozen songs into just as many minutes. If you were keeping a tally, the message was clear: Usher has hits. Also: Usher has friends. Alicia Keys appeared for a cute duet of “My Boo.” Longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri materialized to play hype man. H. E.R. and Will.i.am were there, too. During the shriek-and-boom of his boisterous curtain closer, “Yeah,” Usher was flanked by Lil Jon and Ludacris, shouting out his Atlanta stomping grounds to the rest of the planet: “I took the world to the A!”\n\nIt goes without saying that Usher had been preparing for this — if not from the moment his singing first turned heads in nearby church pews during his Tennessee childhood, then from his tween years in the Atlanta talent show scene where powerful music biz forces began steering him toward fame as if it were preordained. He became a teenage heartthrob, then a wholly respectable R&B artist, then something of a generational talent with the 2004 release of “Confessions,” a masterstroke of an album about the sloppy geometry of love triangles and the shape of R&B to come.\n\nWhat happened next? “I’m not in competition with anyone but myself,” Usher told a reporter at the height of “Confessions,” delivering a prophecy that shook out two different ways. In the short term, he fell from pop’s apex, releasing serviceable radio hits and appearing on NBC’s “The Voice.” But in 2021, he turned his focus inward, launching a splashy Las Vegas residency where his ramped-up showmanship became the stuff of enthusiastic digital blab and incessant memes. With smarts and discipline, Usher treated this new hype factory more like a training facility. He was finally in true competition with himself, and night after night, the competition became more exponentially steep. By the end of his “My Way” residency last year, he didn’t sound like he’d been reviving his career so much as perfecting himself.\n\nUsher has more to show for those countless hours of Las Vegas refinement than landing this halftime gig, too. On Friday, he dropped his ninth studio album, “Coming Home,” an expansive and scrupulous trove of R&B songs that allow the 45-year-old to bend his voice in unexpected directions (he channels Billy Joel and Young Thug within the space of a few minutes) and then back toward wholly welcome ones (consistent “Confessions”-era precision). Recounting the soft ache of an amicable breakup on “Good Good,” his finely-sculpted phrasing communicates total emotional control. During “On the Side,” he’s retracing his signature love triangles, but the edges feel cleaner, the angles sharper. Just about everything else on “Coming Home” sounds every bit as expert, too, but the album ultimately feels playful, every syllable seemingly sung through a smile.\n\nAny of these new songs would have sounded fabulous and fitting at the Super Bowl, too, but Usher stuck to his signatures, supplying some of them in captivating one-two punches. He sang “Caught Up” and “U Don’t Have to Call” with pulse-hurrying zest (sunshine, elastic). He sang “Burn” and “U Got It Bad” with elegant gravity (smoke, silk). And by the time he got to the serotonin surge of “OMG” he was doing laps around the stage on roller skates — a highlight from his Vegas show; now a highlight in the Super Bowl halftime history books. If it looked like the whole world was sliding beneath his feet it was because he was on top of it.",

  "text": "“He is in a period of his life where passing and death is imminent,” said Sharon Sweda, the leader of the Democratic Party in Lorain County in Ohio, who said she often hears from voters worried about the president’s potential frailty. “We are all on a ticking clock. But when you’re at his age or at Trump’s age, that clock is ticking a little faster, and that’s a concern for voters.”\n\nMany in the party continue to voice confidence in Biden, and they note that Trump himself is not much younger at 77. But Biden’s allies are frustrated by the hand-wringing from an anxious faction of the party, and even as campaign officials point to the president’s record of defying skeptics, they are strategizing internally about how to best combat the unmistakable nervousness.\n\nBut few offered confident assessments that Biden’s stubbornly low approval ratings would rebound before next year, and many conceded that one of the president’s most significant challenges is one he has no control over: his age. Supporters and critics alike suggested that Biden’s prospects may hinge on whether he can find a way to overcome a persistent and growing feeling in the electorate that his advanced age is his defining characteristic.\n\n“Coming off the president’s historic midterm performance, President Biden is delivering results, his agenda is popular with the American people, and we are mobilizing our winning coalition of voters well ahead of next year’s general election,” said Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Next year’s election will be a stark choice between President Biden and the extreme, unpopular MAGA agenda. We’ll win in 2024 by putting our heads down and doing the work, not by fretting about polls.”\n\nBiden’s gait can be stiff, and his physical and verbal stumbles have at times given his critics material. After a Sept. 10 news conference in Vietnam, several conservative outlets noted that he seemed fatigued and ended the event by saying he was ready to go to bed. (His aides point out that the 11-hour time difference could have been challenging for anyone.)",

  "text": "Walking with purpose, pulling up his shirt sleeves, glad-handing voters, commanding the podium — the images of Joe Biden flashing across swing-state television and computer screens since late August present a vibrant and pointed departure from the way most Americans now see the president. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.About 3 in 4 U.S. adults recently told CNN pollsters that Biden failed to inspire confidence and raised “serious concerns” about his physical and mental competence. But this is a different leader shown in the new ads: Here he is before Congress saying no one should bet against America. There he is at the rope line giving a Black teenager a “go-get-’em-tiger” tap on the chest. Wages are rising. Manufacturing is back.\n\nIt’s a major investment for a still-growing campaign. Through the end of June, Biden’s campaign organization had raised less than $23 million, all in checks no larger than $3,300. The same account is now shouldering the costs of the first weeks of a $25 million, 16-week television and digital campaign, overwhelmingly aimed at the swing-state voters that will decide the election. A person involved — who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on internal discussions — said it remains uncertain whether the campaign will foot the entire bill through December, or whether the deeper pockets of the Democratic National Committee and state parties, which raised nearly $50 million more through the end of June, begin to spend as well.\n\nThe full ad campaign has separate spots to target Hispanics — with a Puerto Rican accent in Pennsylvania and a Mexican one in Arizona — with a separate tag line, “Somos Nosotros,” or “It’s Us.” African American spots praise Biden’s work to cut “Black child poverty” and grow “Black businesses.” An abortion rights message is covered with a female narrator, while a young mom cement mason in the Wisconsin testimonial says Biden is “helping real people.” Unlike Obama, who relied heavily on direct-to-camera speaking for his positive spots, these narrated ads typically unfold as montages of the American people and Biden in action.\n\nVeterans of past Democratic presidential campaigns such as former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and Jim Margolis, an ad man for Obama and Hillary Clinton, praised the unusual strategy as smart politics. The first major ad buy for Trump’s reelection bid didn’t come until October 2020 and Obama waited until March of 2012 to start sustained spending, after a short burst in January to push back on Republican ads.\n\nBut the early spending is also an implicit admission of the challenge of reaching voters in an evolving media landscape, which has been a focus for the Biden team, who spent the early years of Biden’s presidency researching the rise of social networks like TikTok and crafting new strategies to respond. Biden’s particular weaknesses include his struggles to attract attention through the news media.\n\n“I think the distance between what the president has accomplished and what the public perceives in terms of performance is disconcerting,” Margolis said in an email. “Right now the campaign has the opportunity to begin to tell their story, mostly without opposition advertising getting in their way.”\n\nJohn Del Cecato, a Democratic ad-maker who worked for Obama and the 2020 presidential campaign of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, calls the strategy a “gamble worth making” to raise Biden’s approval rating from the low 40s, which is on par with where both Obama and Trump were at this point in their reelection cycles, according to Gallup.\n\nAs a rough approximation, 100 ratings points allows all viewers to see a spot once, so 3,500 is a frequency of 35 ad views per viewer. Over 16 weeks, this works out to about 20 percent of the ad volume that a presidential campaign typically runs in the closing months, according to ad buyers.\n\nMajor news events are also a focus of the buy. He purchased a 60-second ad in swing states on Sunday’s broadcast of CBS’s “60 Minutes,” a spot focused on his efforts to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion that will air while Biden is overseas on a foreign trip.  He also bought time in key markets during the first game of the NFL season last Thursday, focused on Biden’s efforts to lower inflation.\n\nBut the bulk of the money is going to traditional swing-state broadcasts, digital platforms like YouTube and even streaming television offerings like Hulu and Freebie, the campaign said. Some of the Spanish-language advertising is going to WAPA, the Puerto Rican television network that is watched in states like Pennsylvania.\n\nThe advertising campaign is being led by three returning veterans of the 2020 Biden campaign: Patrick Bonsignore, the 2020 director of paid media; Adrian Saenz, who put together this cycle’s Latino-focused ads; and Terrance Green, who is overseeing African American outreach. Mike Donilon, a longtime ad man for Biden, still works as a senior White House adviser and has occasionally weighed in on the effort in his personal capacity, like other top Biden political advisers still working in government, according to people familiar with the effort.\n\n“In a fragmented media environment, it’s more important than ever for our campaign to be investing early and aggressively across platforms to deliver our message where voters are,” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “While Republicans duke it out and burn cash fighting each other, our campaign is reaching our general election audience early and consistently — which is critical for winning in November 2024.”\n\nThe decision to spend such a large slice of the early off-year fundraising is driven in part by the Biden reelection effort’s ability to offload many of the early costs on accounts with higher donation limits controlled by the Democratic National Committee and affiliated state parties. Biden campaign staff only started working out of offices in Wilmington, Del., in recent weeks, after working the first months from borrowed desks at the national party headquarters.\n\nThe strategy also indicates the campaign’s confidence in raising significant money next year, as they have essentially abandoned the traditional approach of early stockpiling of campaign funds to be used in the final weeks before Election Day, when candidates are given lower rates on television than outside groups. Democrats widely believe that Biden’s Republican opponent, who most now expect to be Trump, will provide more than ample incentive to open a 2024 spigot of small-dollar donations.",

  "text": "Albright said many Black voters, especially younger ones, have been disillusioned by Biden’s policies, especially on student debt — his effort to forgive borrowers was overturned by the Supreme Court — and his fervent support of Israel. Albright predicted many Black voters would still end up supporting Biden, but he said the president runs the risk of having some sit out the 2024 election if his campaign does not ramp up engagement with voters.\n\nThe Biden campaign and its supporters sought to quickly tamp down the concerns, arguing that polls often paint a dire picture for incumbent presidents a year before the election and may not reflect voters’ behavior on Election Day. Most voters are not tuned into politics at this point in an election cycle, they said, and the environment will improve for Biden once he officially has a clear Republican opponent.\n\nDemocrats not directly involved in the reelection campaign questioned whether Biden’s strategy of emphasizing the economy and “Bidenomics” agenda has been effective, and whether it is time for a shift in messaging and tactics. The president should be campaigning more actively, they say, taking on Trump and the other Republicans with vigor and emphasizing social issues such as abortion rights where Democrats enjoy a big advantage.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, a veteran Democratic strategist, said the Biden team still has considerable work to do, particularly with younger people and Black and Latino voters. “Once it’s Trump and Biden next year, a big chunk of that will come back. We need all of it to come back,” Rosenberg said. “There’s a distance between Biden and younger voters that we’re going to have to overcome. This is a weakness that we’re going to have to address. I think it is doable.”\n\nDemocrats have long expected a competitive general election against Trump as the likely Republican nominee, and a recent memo from Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager, emphasized that the election would be close. She argued that Biden was well-positioned to win, however, because of the consistency and popularity of his message; the extreme positions of any possible Republican nominee; and Democrats’ unity behind his candidacy.\n\n“A campaign strategy isn’t always obvious or evident a year from the election,” he added. “A lot will happen over the next three and six months that will help shape the election. I can guarantee that we will look back on this conversation and say ‘Wow, we never anticipated that’ and you can fill in the blank. At the end of the day, Joe Biden knows how to lead. Donald Trump does not.”\n\nThe result is a new level of anxiety among Democrats. “The chatter level is at an intensity I have not seen it before,” said one Democratic strategist, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide a candid picture. “There are concerns among people in the consulting world that the campaign is not being run the way it’s supposed to be run.”\n\nSome political veterans have previously derided such fears as “bed-wetting,” saying Democrats are quick to panic at the slightest provocation. But the closeness of the potential Biden-Trump race is seen by some with genuine alarm, especially given that Biden’s likely opponent faces an array of criminal charges, sought to overturn the last election and has vowed revenge against his political opponents if he wins again.\n\n“Once this is a binary choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, then these numbers will change and they will change quickly — we know this from every campaign,” Messina said. “It’s what happens because we are a very partisan country and everyone wants someone else, including probably my wife, but in the end she’s not going to get something else.”\n\nBiden allies also said that a year out from the election is traditionally a low point for incumbents seeking reelection. In 2012, Obama was struggling and did not settle on the strategy that eventually helped him win a second term until late in 2011. But Obama was facing a likely opponent in Mitt Romney who was far less-known that Trump is now, suggesting Biden has less room to change the current dynamic.",

  "text": "For the second time in a week, a poll shows that three-quarters of Americans, including two-thirds of Democrats, consider President Biden too old for the office. In the new Wall Street Journal poll, 73 percent of Americans said the phrase “too old to run for president” captures Biden at least “somewhat well,” with even Democrats agreeing overwhelmingly. The results echo an Associated Press-NORC poll from last week, which found that 77 percent of Americans overall and 69 percent of Democrats said Biden was “too old to effectively serve” another four-year term.\n\nIt’s evident that this is a growing problem for Biden. But how much might it actually matter in a deeply polarized country in which the likely alternative has been criminally indicted four times?\n\nBiden’s age problem is clearly bigger than it once was. But more specifically, it’s a growing perceived mental-sharpness problem, and the gap between him and former president Donald Trump on such questions has also expanded.\n\nThe Fox News poll isn’t the only one to suggest that the mental angle is now significantly more of a liability for Biden than Trump. The Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that while 69 percent of independents said Biden didn’t have the required “mental sharpness,” just 43 percent said the same of Trump.\n\nIt’s natural to ask at this point how much it matters. The New York Times in April published an analysis downplaying the significance and pointing to the impact of polarization — as well as to Trump’s many problems not related to age or mental sharpness. Polling expert Nate Silver, by contrast, argued over the weekend that Democrats ought to be more concerned than they currently are.\n\nSilver’s analysis strikes me as reasonable. It’s not that the three-quarters of people who say Biden is too old won’t actually vote for him; many will. Democrats as a whole have increasingly rallied around Biden, and the alternative of Trump looms large.\n\nWhat’s more, there is evidence that “too old” isn’t close to a dealbreaker for many of the would-be Biden supporters who have that reservation about him. In a July Suffolk University poll, 37 percent of Democratic-leaning voters said Biden’s age made them less likely to support him, as compared to the two-thirds who now say he’s too old.\n\nThat 37 percent saying they were less likely to back Biden over his age was similar to the 34 percent of Republican-leaning voters who said the same of Trump’s initial indictment in New York. And much of the conventional wisdom pretends as if Trump’s indictments are something of a political non-factor.\n\nBut Silver’s analysis closes with an important point. It’s not so much that this is currently a major liability; it’s that it’s going to loom on the campaign trail. “This election is probably going to be close, and Trump might be only one Biden-has-a-McConnell-moment away from winning,” Silver wrote, referring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) two on-camera freeze-ups.\n\nThe problem is that the margins are just so fine, and this issue presents the vast majority of voters with a historically unusual liability, however compelling they might ultimately find it, to balance against Trump’s liabilities.\n\nThere is a large universe of people who not only think Biden is too old but, relatedly, that his mental acuity is actually an impediment to his service as president. When those saying these things include 7 in 10 independents and two-thirds of your own base — the people most likely to view you in the most positive light and give you the benefit of the doubt — it’s something that must be reckoned with.\n\nThere is logically a point at which that impediment could rise as a priority, depending in part on how Biden deals with it and in part on the perceived magnitude of Trump’s own problems. For now, the issue is trending in the wrong direction for Biden.",

  "text": "McCarthy accused Biden of lying “to the American people about knowledge of his family’s foreign business dealings,” specifically saying that then-Vice President Joe Biden had interacted with Hunter as he was using his family name while working to secure foreign business deals. While staunch far-right Republicans have claimed that is enough to impeach Biden, many conservative lawmakers in the conference say they have yet to see a direct link that reaches the threshold of the high crimes and misdemeanors that are among impeachable offenses.\n\nHouse Republican leaders remain in a tenuous position as they balance the myriad demands by conservatives to significantly curtail spending and fund the government by the end of the month without input from Democrats. McCarthy in particular is being targeted by several far-right lawmakers who have publicly stated that he must abide by promises to members of the House Freedom Caucus in exchange for supporting him for speaker in January. The House faces a critical Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and avoid a shutdown.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus and other far-right lawmakers have begun to speculate on how McCarthy would need to lead during the upcoming fiscal fight if he wanted to prevent his ouster from the speaker’s seat. Several have warned that such a vote, known as a motion to vacate, could be triggered if McCarthy relies on Democratic votes, rather than Republicans’, to avert a government shutdown.\n\nBut McCarthy’s calculation on how to launch an impeachment inquiry changed after his leadership team surveyed the conference over the past week and recognized that there would not be enough votes to open an inquiry on the House floor, according to multiple Republican lawmakers and aides familiar with the conversations, who like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nIn an effort to fulfill the Freedom Caucuses’ demand to pass all 12 individual appropriations bills and fund the government for the full fiscal year, Republican leaders know they must pass a short-term funding bill that extends current government spending levels. But the Freedom Caucus has said they need to see border security, curtailed spending on the Justice Department and FBI, as well as measures limiting the “woke policies” at the Pentagon, included.\n\n“My question for my colleagues, particularly my Republican colleagues, is when is it enough? When is it enough to stand up and do what you campaigned to do and use the power of the purse to stop this administration from trampling the American people,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) said.\n\nEven though the Freedom Caucus wants to pass as many funding bills as possible, they are preparing to prevent that from happening as soon as Wednesday, potentially blocking a procedural hurdle that allows consideration of a bill funding the Defense Department. They say they have yet to receive a number of demands from leadership regarding the remaining appropriations process, requiring the move.",

  "text": "Taylor Swift made her highly anticipated arrival at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas slightly before 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Her next six hours were a roller coaster as she watched the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, fall behind the San Francisco 49ers by 10 points; rally in the second half to take a lead; rally again late in the fourth quarter to force overtime; and finally score the game-winning touchdown in overtime for a 25-22 win.\n\nKelce finished with a game-high nine catches for a game-high 93 receiving yards, and in the moments after the game, Swift was there, celebrating the dramatic win. Kelce and Swift embraced on the field and kissed as the cameras zoomed in on their celebration.\n\nSwift showed up with her parents, Scott and Andrea, along with her brother, Austin. As far as her squad members, she brought along one of her best friends, actress Blake Lively, as well as close pal stylist Ashley Avignone and rapper Ice Spice, Swift’s duet partner from the remix of “Karma.”\n\nThis time, Swift accessorized with a tiny, sparkly, football-shaped purse with Travis Kelce’s No. 87 on it, as well as an 87 necklace — and a red jacket casually slung over her shoulder.\n\nBefore the game, TMZ reported that Kelce had shelled out about $1 million to secure a suite for his family and friends, as well as Swift’s family and friends. Swift greeted Jason Kelce with a hug and was seen chatting with Jason’s wife, Kylie Kelce.\n\nWell, Jason Kelce — Travis’s brother and the Philadelphia Eagles center — was already seen chatting with Ice Spice, so that’s more than the internet could have dreamed. Plus, Swift took a few minutes to talk with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nThe first quarter was basically Swift-free, but the cameras excitedly panned to see how she would react to a long completion from Patrick Mahomes to Mecole Hardman: She gasped, mouth agape, watching to see how the play would conclude. They did not show her reaction when the Chiefs fumbled on the next play.\n\nCBS managed to get one more glimpse of Taylor Swift in the suite before halftime, this time with Lana Del Rey and producer Riot — but the Nickelodeon broadcast was the place to spot Swift, at least until the Chiefs rallied in the second half.\n\nBut as the Chiefs rallied and Kelce became more involved in the second half, the Swift shots increased, and she was shown during the broadcast about a dozen times.\n\nAfter another shot of Swift dancing in the second half, CBS branched out to show some other celebrity attendees: Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Post Malone, LeBron James, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, along with Lady Gaga, who was sporting some truly incredible sparkling eye makeup.\n\nThe Chiefs didn’t take their first lead until the second half, which led to a celebratory scene in a certain luxury suite. By late in the fourth quarter, Kelce had become a considerably bigger part of the action; he played a huge role in Kansas City’s final drive in regulation, which led to a game-tying field goal that forced overtime. And he was huge again on the Chiefs’ game-winning drive.\n\nAs the Chiefs celebrated on the field after receiving the Lombardi Trophy, Kelce — interviewed by CBS’s Jim Nantz — broke into a raucous, screaming version of “Viva Las Vegas.” Later, he mixed in a round of “Fight for Your Right.”\n\nAs she did after the AFC championship game in Baltimore, Swift smiled in the crowd as Kelce yelled his acceptance speech during the trophy ceremony. Afterward, Kelce made his way down to the field and he and Swift reunited.\n\n“As I look at Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, we’ve been talking about their relationship all year long, that right there is special,” CBS commentator Nate Burleson said. “That woman is damn near in tears. Travis is emotional. That’s real love. That’s what you can get when you have the support of a woman behind you. He has had one hell of a season.”",

For more Style stories, click here. Ever since Swift was featured on national television rooting for Kelce at Arrowhead Stadium at the Chiefs-Chicago Bears game on Sept. 24, coverage of the relationship between the world’s biggest pop star and the NFL’s celebrity tight end continues to reach stratospheric heights. It’s only destined to increase as the Chiefs head to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas on Feb. 11 after defeating the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC conference championship on Sunday. Swift attended nine Chiefs games this season, plus all three playoff matchups, and pulses quicken when the cameras catch a glimpse of her cheering from an elite suite. (Experts have done the math: Despite having a concert in Tokyo on Feb. 10, Swift could theoretically arrive in Vegas well before kickoff.)\n\nHowever, despite thousands of articles and photos and memes and TikTok fan edits, Swift and Kelce have pulled off the ultimate trick: For a famous couple that is so public-facing — he traveled to Argentina to watch one of her shows on the Eras Tour, she braved frigid temperatures for his games, they both showed up on “Saturday Night Live” — no one really knows anything about the time they spend together. Kelce spoke admirably about her in an interview for a November profile in WSJ, the Wall Street Journal’s luxury magazine, and occasionally, ever so obliquely, refers to her on his top-rated podcast, while Swift revealed a bit more about their origin story in an interview she gave to Time when the magazine named her person of the year.\n\nIt’s a wonder everyone around them didn’t immediately faint. Instead, dozens of onlookers and reporters posted video of the interactions to social media, leaving Swift fans in shambles — especially because, for the first time, they could hear the two having an actual conversation. “How about that one, huh?!” Kelce exclaimed, as Swift leaned on his shoulder. “I’ve never seen anything like that,” Swift beamed. Kelce went over to hug his father, then turned back to Swift: “What’s up, Sweetie? Where were you guys at?” Swift pointed to a suite in the distance. “It was the best view ever, it was insane,” Swift said, then grinned at him again. “I can’t believe it.” They started hugging and kissing again.\n\nMichalik, who has covered entertainment for years working in radio, calls herself a “mild Swiftie” and more of a general pop culture fan when it comes to her fascination with Swift and Kelce. She is consumed with questions, especially when Swift travels to Kansas City: Does Kelce drive to the tarmac to greet her private jet? Does she then jump into his arms, like contestants do on “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette”? Or does a security detail drive her to his house? Then does she knock? Does she ring the doorbell? Does her security sit outside? Where’s her assistant? Is her assistant in the house?\n\nShe has theories about why people are so captivated, including the fact that they are the rare superstar couple from different orbits (like the U. S. version of Posh and Becks) and women everywhere can relate to “the American Dream” of dating the handsome football player. Michalik referenced a January essay from Los Angeles Times columnist Amy Kaufman, who explored her own unexpected “obsession” with Swift and Kelce’s relationship. Kaufman traced it back to her experiences in high school, where everyone learns early on to pay attention to the quarterbacks and cheerleaders (and, as Swift would say, the girls on the bleachers) and their comparable analogues.\n\nThen, a day cemented in Swiftie history: In the middle of his bye week, on Nov. 11, Kelce attended the second of Swift’s three sold-out stadium shows in Buenos Aires. He stood next to her father in the VIP tent, grinning and dancing to the music. During her final song, “Karma,” Swift laughed as she changed a lyric from, “Karma is the guy on the screen,” to, “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs.” If that didn’t send fans into enough of a frenzy, when the concert ended, she raced off the stage and straight into Kelce’s arms, where they kissed in front of everyone.\n\n“Every single time she goes out, or she steps outside for two seconds, it’s, ‘Where are the posts?!’” Golich said of the demand for content of the couple. While Golich posts photos from official news sources or ones that have already gone viral, she holds back on publishing much of what people send her. There’s an extreme appetite for the behind-the-scenes of Swift and Kelce in Kansas City, she said, but she wants to try to conserve their privacy as they enjoy everyday activities.",

  "text": "“Hamas is hiding behind Palestinian civilians, and it’s despicable — and, not surprisingly, cowardly, as well,” Biden said. “This also puts an added burden on Israel while they go after Hamas. But that does not lessen the need for us to operate in line with the laws of war. Israel has to do everything in its power.”\n\nHe sought to signal to Arab leaders in the region that he has an agenda for the Middle East that goes beyond Israel’s destruction of Hamas and includes a Palestinian state. “When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next,” Biden said. “And in our view, it has to be a two-state solution. And it means a concentrated effort from all parties — Israelis, Palestinians, regional partners, global leaders — to put us on a path toward peace.”\n\n“I continue to be alarmed about extremist settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank that are pouring gasoline on the fire,” Biden said, noting that the attacks are happening in areas recognized by Israel as Palestinian-controlled. “This was a deal. The deal was made, and they’re attacking Palestinians in places they’re entitled to be. It has to stop. They have to be held accountable, and it has to stop now.”\n\n“I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,” Biden said. “I’m sure innocents have been killed. … I think that Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they’re focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel, and it’s against our interests when that doesn’t happen. But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.”\n\nAs a result, the U. S. warnings to Israel have become unmistakable. “What you’re reading in the statements and what they’re saying publicly is they’re shifting from ‘We’re 100 percent behind Israel’ to ‘We really need to figure out a way not to escalate this conflict — and Israel, your actions are the part that needs to be controlled,’” said a person familiar with the White House’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Biden has devoted less energy than some of his predecessors to trying to bring about peace between Israelis and Palestinians. His long foreign policy experience appeared to convince him of America’s limited influence in that effort. At the same time, Biden seemed to accept the growing conclusion of some leaders in the region that Israel and Arab nations could normalize relations without resolving the Palestinian issue first.\n\nDuring an interview with CBS on Oct. 15, Biden said there needed to be a path to a Palestinian state. But when asked whether Israel would still be open to that solution, given the severity of the Hamas attacks, Biden replied: “Not now. Not now. But I think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.”",

(Saul Martinez for The Washington Post) James Wood had been in the batting cage for almost three hours, but he wanted one more round. It was a January morning in Maryland, a few days before the Washington Nationals prospect was set to leave for spring training in Florida. He wanted to get this right.Wood, wearing a white New York Giants T-shirt, blue sweats and white Nikes with gold swooshes, stepped into the batter’s box. He took a deep breath after sending the last few balls into the batting cage netting. After each pitch, Wood looked down and tried to visualize where it crossed the plate.“Where is that? Feels like it’s out there?” Wood said to Gerardo Caceres, who has coached Wood since he was 13, and Trey Lipscomb, another Nationals prospect. He pointed to the outer part of the plate after fouling a pitch off. “I’m like early, but I’m not.”Wood is a 21-year-old outfielder and a key part of Washington’s rebuild. He’s still developing, still perfecting his craft. He’s also still working on the mental side of the game, still learning that he won’t always get things right. A few minutes later, he whiffed on a pitch and stepped out of the box. He stared at the ceiling and let out a deep sigh. He watched three more pitches go by before hitting a groundball. After two more takes, he rolled his eyes and mumbled to himself, “That’s a strike.”Wood fouled off one final pitch before he motioned for Lipscomb to take his place. Then he ambled behind the screen and caught his breath.“It’s why baseball drives people crazy,” Wood said. “It’s hard, but I try not to [be perfect]. But it still happens. … I think here is where you kind of try and be perfect with your intent and your mechanics.”‘It was never about his success or failure’James Wood’s mother, Paula, can remember a day when her 9-year-old son wasn’t hitting well. His team was losing, so he went into a mental funk that he couldn’t shake, even after his squad came back to win.Wood’s parents “lit into him” on the ride home, Paula Wood said. The way his mom saw it, Wood wasn’t going to play on the team anymore if he wasn’t going to be a good teammate. The next morning, Wood wrote an apology letter that he initially addressed to his parents and later sent to his coaches.“I really should have been cheerful to my team when they were cheering me on instead of having a big bad attitude,” he wrote.That letter still hangs on the refrigerator at the family’s home in Maryland.“For us, it was never about his success or failure on the field,” Paula Wood said. “It was about your attitude about it and who you are as a teammate.”Paula Wood said that’s when her son learned how his drive could work for him instead of against him. Now Wood is preparing for his fourth professional season — and his second full year in the Nationals organization — hoping for a 2024 that meets his expectations.Wood’s 2023 campaign was one many would envy, even if he felt he had inconsistent mechanics and didn’t put the ball in play enough. He smashed 26 home runs and drove in 91 runs with a .520 slugging percentage — all first among Nationals minor leaguers. His .874 OPS ranked second. He stole 18 bases. And he jumped a level from high Class A Wilmington to Class AA Harrisburg. If he continues to progress, he could be in the majors this season.“There’s a lot I could improve on,” said Wood, whose laid-back demeanor often conceals his desire for perfection. “So I kind of just … I’m definitely happy about the year I had. But I still got a lot that I could’ve done better.”The biggest knock on Wood heading into this season is a familiar one — his strikeout total. Wood struck out in 31.5 percent of his plate appearances. Critics have taken note, which is why he has fallen slightly on most preseason rankings. But he’s still the No. 2 prospect in the organization on most listings, behind Dylan Crews, the LSU outfielder whom Washington made the No. 2 pick of the 2023 draft.‘Just trying to be myself’Caceres, the coach who has worked with Wood for years, has noticed he is paying closer attention to details and not just relying on his talent.“I’m going to be honest with you: I think he’s a freak superhero, that he is using only half of his powers,” Caceres said. “Because I don’t think he has been maximized yet.”Wood spent the offseason watching video, trying to learn and improve. He wants to trust himself to let fastballs get deeper in the strike zone before he swings. Nothing can compare with game reps, but he tried to replicate what he could. Earlier in the offseason, Caceres set up a fastball machine and a breaking ball machine so Wood had to react naturally.And in the cages in January, Wood tracked the path of each ball that left his bat. If he hit a fastball fair down the left field line, that gave him a sense of how deep he could let the ball get. The longer he can let the ball travel, the better he can adjust to spin. He also has made a few mechanical adjustments to load better with his hips, keep his weight back and stay inside the baseball.“I’m still trying to drive the ball,” Wood said, “but just doing it under control. … Just trying to be myself, make it simple and as easy as it possibly can be for myself.”Wood had dropped to 215 pounds by the end of last season. This offseason, he went to agent Scott Boras’s facility in Florida to learn how to put on and maintain weight. Heading into 2024, Wood is roughly 240 pounds. He hopes the change will allow him to take another leap.“He’s always been obsessed with baseball in a different way than anything else in his life,” Paula Wood said. “So, like, his room? No. Like, his uniform? No. But about the sport of baseball? Yes. And I think a lot of people miss it because it’s not how he is in other parts of his life and because of his demeanor. He’s got that laid-back demeanor, so people don’t realize just how dedicated he is to doing baseball the right way.”Wood grinned as he reflected on the last time he fell short of his goals. He thought back to high school, when he faced the same critiques he faces now. Back then, he tried to be someone he wasn’t at the plate — and things only got worse. This time, he feels better prepared. Others have noticed his maturity.Caceres remembers attending a Harrisburg Senators game last season. Wood struck out three times in a row — he thought Wood might have been trying to impress him. Then, in his fourth at-bat, Wood hit a home run.“You don’t want to be perfect in this game,” Caceres said. “You’re going to fail a lot. So for him, he understands that failing is a part of the game. He understands that failing is normal. It’s okay because he found his reset button.”Josiah Gray tinkers with his game often. At what point is it too much?Josiah Gray tinkers with his game often.

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\n🎵‘I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover’🎵Nearly half of all Americans have heard of the conspiracy theory that Taylor Swift is covertly working with the government to reelect President Biden, according to a Monmouth University poll conducted by phone from Thursday to Monday. Most Americans dismiss the theory outright — 73 percent to 18 percent. However, of the 18 percent who believe the conspiracy exists, 71 percent of those identify with, or lean toward, the Republican Party; and 83 percent said they are likely to support former president Donald Trump in the fall.“Even mild conspiracy theories have the sort of negative effect that it makes it easier to believe other conspiracy theories,” said Richard Greene, a philosophy professor at Weber State University in Utah and co-author of a book on conspiracy theories. The theory goes like this: None of it was accidental. The government arranged for Taylor Swift to activate her Gen Z fans as voters by “dating” Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, whose games were rigged so his team would make it to the Super Bowl, where, halfway through, the couple would endorse Biden for reelection, swaying unsuspecting viewers and tilting Democracy toward an unnatural conclusion.Perhaps a theory like this was destined to consume all of our attention, according to Joseph E. Uscinski, a political science professor at the University of Miami who specializes in conspiracy theories. “It gets attention because you have the biggest singer in the world, the biggest sporting event in the world, combined with the biggest and most important election in the world,” Uscinski told The Washington Post in an email.The theory may also have been manufactured not to fool the masses, but rather, sway just one very specific person. “It seems unlikely that a large segment of the population really believes she is part of a psyop,” Barbara McQuade, an MSNBC contributor and author of the forthcoming book, “Attack From Within: How Disinformation Is Sabotaging America,” told The Post. “I think it is somebody trying to stir up this controversy in the hopes that she refrains from endorsing Joe Biden.”Swift’s following on social media — more than 535 million — dwarfs the size of those pushing the conspiracy theory about her. And she has increasingly been wading into politics. Swift endorsed Democrats in 2018, leading to a spike in voter registrations. In June 2019, she took a public stance against Trump’s LGBTQ+ policies and admittedly regretted not endorsing Hillary Clinton. Swift endorsed Biden in 2020. After she posted an Instagram story last year encouraging people to register to vote, traffic to Vote.org spiked by more than 1,200 percent within an hour, according to its CEO, Andrea Hailey.So when the New York Times reported last month that Biden’s campaign was, again, looking for Swift’s endorsement, Trump supporters had a strong reaction. Some on TV told her not to do it. Others, online, said it was proof powerful forces were up to something.The idea started off as laughable and was largely ignored, when early iterations of it were tweeted by Laura Loomer, a far-right extremist, who started her rambling post with this question: “Has @taylorswift13 made a deal with George Soros and Alex Soros to get the rights to her music back in exchange for getting Zoomers registered to vote Democrat against President Trump ahead of the 2024 Presidential election?”🎵‘I knew you were trouble when you walked in’🎵But a darker version of the idea became conventional MAGA wisdom by Dec. 6 when more influential right-wing personalities attacked Swift immediately after she was named Time magazine’s person of the year. And within a month it became frustratingly unavoidable when, on Jan. 9, days before Kelce’s team had its first playoff game, Fox News’s Jesse Watters stared into a television camera and asked his million of viewers: “So, how is the psyop going?”What would otherwise be a heartwarming story of a love transcending America’s disparate cultures has now become an example of that disconnect. “Those who use disinformation to divide us try to demonize that which is other,” McQuade said of the conspiracy theory aimed at Swift. And  added, Swift “could be seen as a threat to Republicans,”  because she has encouraged young people to vote, and young people tend to vote more liberal than their older counterparts.At the heart of this theory isn’t a secret government program, or open-air election interference. Rather, it may all flow out of old-fashioned sexism, the kind Swift, 34, has been battling throughout her nearly two-decade career. And despite the NFL’s effort to reach younger and female viewers, it is, according to McQuade, “very traditional, very male.” “Perhaps,” she added, “there are some who take offense to her intrusion on that world.”🎵 ‘Is it chill that you’re in my head?’ 🎵Sept. 26: An early version of this conspiracy theory was posted online by Loomer, who argued Swift’s stepped up political engagement is linked to her fight to regain control of her music catalogue from George Soros, a major Democratic funder and frequent target of antisemitic conspiracies. In exchange for doing one, she’d get the other. But Swift’s support of Democrats started before December 2019, when Swift publicly complained about the sale of her music catalogue to a business entity whose link to Soros has not been confirmed. A spokesperson for Soros’s Open Society Foundation told the Wall Street Journal these theories were “preposterous.”But Loomer’s post, and others like it, got millions of views on X, formerly known as Twitter.Loomer kept posting about Swift, and in October claimed  she was part of “a highly organized political opp ahead of 2024.”🎵 ‘It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me’🎵Dec. 6: Early that morning, Time magazine named Swift  its person of the year. For right-wing media personalities, that was proof. They quickly labeled her, and her accomplishment, a “psyop,” a term popular among those on the right for anything they find suspicious and claim is orchestrated by powerful forces.The Taylor Swift girlboss psyop has been fully activated. From her hand-selected vaccine shill boyfriend to her DINK lifestyle to her upcoming 2024 voter operation for Democrats on abortion rights\n\nIt’s all coming https://t.co/8ce47qv6Zo— Jack Poso 🇺🇸 (@JackPosobiec) December 6, 2023\n\nJack Posobiec — a former Navy intelligence officer and far-right media personality, known for advancing conspiracy theories such as “Pizzagate,” picked up the Swift conspiracy theory. Posobiec told his 675,000 followers on Gettr — a controversial social media platform once led by Trump senior adviser Jason Miller — that “the Taylor swift psyop for 2024 has been activated.” Thirty minutes later, Posobiec  told his more than 2 million followers on X that “The Taylor Swift girlboss psyop has been fully activated.”The same day Posobiec credited Ye, the controversial rapper formerly known as Kanye West who has feuded with the pop star, with having “tried to warn us about the Taylor Swift psyop and we didn’t listen.”As of Friday, Feb. 9, Posobiec’s posts about Swift had more than 4.5 million views on X. Posobiec did not respond to an email seeking comment.Also on Dec. 6, another influential account picked up the theory. The “regime has plans to weaponize her just in time for 2024,” End Wokeness told its 2.2 million followers on X, which include Jesse Watters, MAGA favorite Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), and former Trump senior advisers Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino Jr.Hours later,  Miller, who now runs a law firm called America First Legal, put his spin on the theory. “What’s happening with Taylor Swift is not organic,” Miller wrote in a post that now has nearly 4 million views. Miller did not respond to an email seeking comment.What’s happening with Taylor Swift is not organic.— Stephen Miller (@StephenM) December 6, 2023\n\n🎵 ‘You’re talking s--- for the hell of it’ 🎵Jan. 9: Just after 3 a.m., a short video was posted on X by Mike Benz, a former Trump administration official who has more than 147,000 followers on the site.The video shows Benz watching a snippet of a 2019 conference organized by NATO, where a research engineer at Johns Hopkins briefly mentioned using a celebrity like Taylor Swift to combat disinformation. “Are you f---ing kidding me,” Benz yelled into a microphone, claiming it was proof NATO “had worked with her in the past.” In posting the video, Benz wrote, inaccurately, that it showed “the incredible moment” when a representative from the Pentagon “pitched NATO’s military psyops center on turning Taylor Swift into an asset.”At 11:11 a.m., Elon Musk, who owns X and has promoted discredited accounts, responded to Benz’s inaccurate post. “Doesn’t seem like an effective way to combat ‘disinformation,’” Musk wrote to his 171 million followers.By 8 p.m., the video that Benz surfaced and to which Musk responded  was featured on Fox News.“Have you ever wondered why, or how, she blew up like this?”  Watters asked about Swift, even though her record-setting Eras tour was filling stadiums for months before the Swift theories took hold.Watters featured a clip from the same video Benz had shared, then told his millions of viewers: “The Pentagon psyop unit pitched NATO on turning Taylor Swift into an asset, for combating misinformation online.”On Jan. 9, Fox News host Jesse Waters referenced a clip from the 2019 Nato CYCON, arguing that Taylor Swift may be a Pentagon PsyOp asset. (Video: TWP)“So,” Watters asked his audience that January night, “how’s the psyop going?” A spokesperson for Fox News did not provide a comment when asked about Watters’s segment.Watters posted the segment on X, and asked again: “Is Taylor Swift a Pentagon PsyOp asset?”   As of Friday, the post had more than 1.6 million views.Watters’s segment blasted the chatter into new heights. Within about an hour of Watters’s sharing his video on X, the Patriot Voice reposted it. “Wakey, wakey!” the Patriot Voice told its followers in a post that had  2.2 million views as of Friday.Loomer also reposted Watters’s segment on X, and said, “Told ya months ago” about Swift. In an interview, Loomer told The Post: “I was more poking fun at Fox News, kind of, I guess you can say ripping off my original idea that I had proposed.” Loomer added, “I never said she was a pentagon psyop,” and “I don’t watch the Super Bowl.”🎵‘Look what you just made me do’🎵Jan. 10 to 31: The day after Watters’s segment, the Pentagon refuted the conspiracy theory, with a healthy dose of annoyance and eyerolls. “[A]s for this conspiracy theory, we are going to shake it off,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said in a statement, employing an obvious reference to Swift’s song, Politico reported.A day after that denial, popular far-right activist Charlie Kirk said: “What is the Taylor Swift op, because there’s obviously, there is somebody either using, or deploying, Taylor Swift for a reason,” Kirk said in a video he shared on Facebook.A constellation of far-right media personalities also amplified the story of the Pentagon’s denial, including the Epoch Times, One America News, NTD television and radio host Larry Elder. For outlets that cater to audiences peeling away from Fox News, “everything is more evidence to prove the conspiracy theory is correct,” said Juliet Jeske, an independent media journalist who writes extensively about Fox News.End Wokeness, again, posted about the conspiracy theory late last month, this time adding as proof: “We all feel it. We all know it.” As of Friday, the post had more than 6.8 million views.Others were now describing the conspiracy theory as inevitable. Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy — who during his presidential campaign embraced conspiracy theories about Jan. 6, covid and the 2020 election — implied the Super Bowl and Swift’s endorsement of Biden were forgone conclusions. Around 2.7 million had viewed that message on X, as of Friday.February: The right-wing figures who kept the conspiracy theory in circulation may have generated clicks and attention for their brands, but they also incurred widespread backlash.The Pentagon this month issued another statement denying the  theory. “Taylor Swift is not part of DOD psychological operation. Period,” said Singh, the deputy spokeswoman at the Department of Defense.Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor of California who has feuded with Trump, mocked those promoting the conspiracy theory. “Remember, everything is a plant,” he told Variety, mocking the conspiracy theorists.Comedian Bill Maher told viewers of his popular HBO show about the conspiracy theory by prefacing it with: “The right wing, they are just mental.”On Feb. 4, former R.N.C. chair Reince Priebus called the conspiracy theories spread about Taylor Swift by republicans a \"powder keg of stupidity\". (Video: TWP)The most knowing rebuke may have come from Reince Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman who briefly served as Trump’s White House chief of staff. He told ABC’s “This Week,” that the theory was “a powder keg of stupidity.”However, when asked by host George Stephanopoulos where ideas like this come from, Priebus pointed out: “Look, we live in a world where division is profit, unity is a loser.”Clara Ence Morse, Alex Horton and Will Sommer contributed to this report.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nThe talk of spring training this year? Somehow, it’s the pants. For two weeks, MLB has been mired in a sartorial controversy of unprecedented proportions. (Rebecca Blackwell/AP Photo) SARASOTA, Fla. — New ace Corbin Burnes took the mound for the Baltimore Orioles for the first time Saturday afternoon in a spring training game. An eager crowd analyzed his every move, desperate to see a winter of promise thaw into reality, a process replicated on sun-soaked fields across Florida and Arizona.That scrutiny is an annual ritual, but this year, it has been redirected. Because this year, everyone from MLB officials to players to fans was focused as much on what Burnes and his colleagues were wearing on the field Saturday as what they did there. For the first time, the full slate of new uniforms MLB debuted with Nike for this season will be exposed to fans in the stands and television cameras. The question somehow dominating spring training is whether those uniforms will expose too much.For two weeks, MLB has been mired in a sartorial controversy of unprecedented proportions, one that began with player distaste for the look of those new jerseys and escalated to concerns — exacerbated by a few surprising photos captured by spring training photographers — that the new white pants are too revealing.“It’s disappointing that we’ve landed in a place where the uniforms are a topic of discussion,” Tony Clark, head of the players union, told reporters in Arizona.The uniforms, designed by Nike in conjunction with MLB and manufactured by Fanatics, will probably remain a topic of conversation for the foreseeable future because player concerns are as widespread as they are varied.Players were initially upset with the jerseys, which are made of a lighter and quicker-drying fabric designed to be more form-fitting than in years past. In conversations with multiple players across five teams, no one raised concerns about the jersey affecting their ability to play. But several raised concerns about the way the jersey looks, which many felt was too much of an afterthought. The lack of heft, combined with smaller numbers and letters, made many players feel as if they were wearing replicas.“I like last year’s way better. And my opinion matches a lot of opinions in here,” said Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Kiermaier, a Nike-sponsored athlete who was therefore choosing his words carefully. Some, such as Kiermaier, are frustrated by the design. Others see issues with the execution.Philadelphia Phillies reliever Matt Strahm, for example, said he had no problem with how the jersey felt as he threw. But when he looked down at it later, he noticed the team’s name on his chest was off-center.“They say it’s because I have a tapered jersey, so the S lands under my armpit,” Strahm said. “When they told me that, I was like, ‘Wait, you didn’t taper the jersey first, then put the logo in the middle?’ ”MLB officials said the taper, like so many of the changes in the new jersey, is the product of six years of research conducted in conjunction with Nike, a process that included player body scans and a trial run at last year’s All-Star Game. Designers chose to make the numbers and letters lighter and smaller to match the decreased heft of the jerseys themselves. But MLB’s calculus does not seem to match that made by the players, many of whom think the smaller appliqués cheapen the look.“I think it’s the nameplate that’s really taken some getting used to for me,” said Washington Nationals reliever Kyle Finnegan, citing not only the smaller letters and numbers but also the fact that the appliqués are perforated instead of solid. “If you ask me in six months, maybe I’ll like it better. But I really can’t tell you. First impression, it’s going to take some getting used to it.”MLB officials anticipated the jerseys would inspire some skepticism because big leaguers are not exactly receptive to change. But when team photo days began, more, well, pressing concerns emerged about the pants. In pictures taken of everyone from Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani to Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, tucked-in jerseys were visible through home white pants. In other cases, tucked-in jerseys would have been preferable to what the cameras captured in that area. It seemed like the new pants were somehow less substantial and provided less cover than older ones.While MLB had been relatively quiet about the jersey concerns, the see-through pants sent officials scrambling. They insist the new pants are the same thickness as the old ones. They pulled pictures of photo days past in which tucked-in jerseys were visible, circulating them to reporters to demonstrate that the old white pants had the same level of transparency. They speculated that the bright lights set up for photo days might have exacerbated a problem that won’t be nearly as glaring on the field. And indeed, as much as those pictures went viral on social media, many players later said they hadn’t noticed the new pants being more transparent until someone mentioned it.“I didn’t notice [the pants] until people started talking about it. Then I noticed I could see my tights through it,” Blue Jays shortstop Bo Bichette said. “That’s why you wear something under your pants.”Kiermaier, his Toronto teammate, said he didn’t notice the new pants for a different reason: He isn’t wearing them. He, like many other players, prefers the fit of last season’s pants, so he’s wearing those for now. And he isn’t imagining the difference: MLB does acknowledge it made a change to the way pants are fitted.Gary and Ron talk about MLB's new uniforms pic.twitter.com/swWCjWzJ8Y— SNY (@SNYtv) February 24, 2024\n\nIn the past, players would come to camp and get their pants tailored based on their personal preferences. This year, to streamline the manufacturing process, Nike decided to manufacture pants in more generic size buckets based on length and the ratio of how much fabric was needed in the butt and thighs. Players can choose which fit they like best, but they cannot modify those preexisting sizes to their exact specifications.“My body type is pretty normal stock, so I fit into them fine,” Blue Jays starter Chris Bassitt said. “But I think it’s pretty unrealistic to think we would have one standard body type, so it’s kind of crazy you can’t make alterations.”The other crazy thing, according to players, is that they don’t have much time to get used to the pants, either. Because multiple teams do not have their new pants yet.“I wish I could comment,” Phillies infielder Bryson Stott said, turning toward his locker and pushing aside jerseys and hoodies before delivering the punchline. “But we don’t have ours yet.”The Phillies are not the only team that has yet to receive its pants. The Athletic reported last week that the Cincinnati Reds were using old pants, too. And while the design of the uniform is Nike’s purview and the overall project MLB’s, it is Fanatics that manufactures the uniforms and is in charge of distribution.But Fanatics has not established a reputation for flawless delivery in the past. Just last year, Nationals clubhouse staffers were up late on the eve of Opening Day, stitching patches honoring late owner Ted Lerner because they had only just received the jerseys in time for the season. MLB said that this year, the goal is to make sure everyone has their uniforms by Opening Day.Fanatics, which produces uniforms in accordance with Nike’s specifications, declined to comment. Nike, which designed the jerseys, offered a statement.“The quality and performance of our product is of the utmost importance to us,” that statement read, in part. “We will continue to work with MLB, the players, and our manufacturing partner to address player uniforms.”MLB officials are touring camps to get player feedback and have not ruled out making changes in response to what they hear. As for the pants, the plan seems to be to wait for games to start and see what exactly they can see.“The only thing that’s different for me feeling-wise is the pants. They’re definitely a little lighter, definitely a little more transparent than you want them to be,” Burnes, the Orioles ace, said after throwing 22 pitches Saturday. “But it’s change. It’s one of those things that players have asked for years for lighter, breathable jerseys. They may have taken it a little too far to the extreme, but I think that’s them listening to players’ feedback and maybe went a little too much too quickly.”Andrew Golden in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.The talk of spring training this year?

  "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Midway through the Washington Nationals’ first day of full-squad workouts Tuesday, Dylan Crews walked past a few dozen autograph-seeking fans, kept his vision straight ahead and politely promised them he would sign after practice. About 20 paces later, he angled around a fence to field flyballs and take his first on-field reps of live batting practice. It took just one swing for Crews, the top prospect in the Nationals’ farm system, to send a pitch from Cole Henry over the right field wall for an opposite-field home run. Before he even stepped to the plate, though, Crews fielded the same query, this time from a dad and his two young daughters. In a quieter moment, he signed their ball.\n\n“That’s the best player we’ve got. That’s the best prospect in baseball,” he said before pointing at the signature. “And we got him right here on this baseball.”\n\nThe real Dylan Crews — the living, breathing outfielder who turns 22 next Monday and introduced himself to his first major league camp with a hushed smile — arrived at the Nationals’ spring training facility in silence Sunday morning, unloaded four bats into the top shelf of his locker and appeared to do everything he could to hush the neon-colored, headbanging, dream-inducing frenzy that the idea of Dylan Crews had manifested.\n\nIn his first three days at camp, it has been clear that the idea of Crews is, well, much louder than the real thing. The idea was plucked from LSU with the No. 2 pick in last year’s draft and given the second-largest signing bonus in MLB draft history. The idea, Baseball America’s No. 6 overall prospect, had a locker at the front entryway of the clubhouse. Next in line? A handful of the team’s other highly acclaimed prospects, with James Wood (No. 11 per BA), Robert Hassell III and Brady House (No. 55) to his left. The idea had a care package from Scott Boras’s agency waiting for him; the box hardly would have stood out in the clubhouse if not for the fact that it was about 50 percent larger than any gift any other player received.\n\nNone of the hoopla has seemed to rock Crews. On his first day, he leaned back in his black folding chair, sipped from a cup of Dunkin’ and allowed clubhouse dynamics to marinate. He mostly kept to himself unless a teammate approached him, in which case he returned the favor with a quiet smile and a brief conversation that curled his mustache upward.\n\nBy Tuesday, his first day out in the open outside of the batting cages, he had slipped into his element, chatting away with his fellow prospects. When asked for his closest compatriot at camp, he pointed to Wood. “This tall guy right here,” he said. He warmed up with outfielder Lane Thomas and took his pointers during flyball drills.\n\n“Coming from a school like LSU, it almost gets you ready for the moments like this,” Crews said. “Playing in front of 10,000 people every day, that’s the most realistic [opportunity] you’ll get and the easiest transition you’ll get coming into a big new locker room like this or a packed-out stadium like you’ll do in the big leagues.”\n\nManager Dave Martinez has identified that poise, too. He called Crews a sponge. He said Crews had a sense of leadership and will have opportunities to play in spring training. Martinez wanted him to fit in. He didn’t have an estimate for Crews’s big league debut, but he was optimistic.\n\n“He’s going to help us,” Martinez said. “I don’t know when. It could be sooner than later. But he’s definitely going to help us — and help us win a lot of games here.”\n\nFor Martinez and General Manager Mike Rizzo, Crews’s summer of 2023 provided quite the springboard. Before the draft, the Florida native helped LSU to the national championship. In 14 games at low Class A Fredericksburg, he slugged five home runs and hit .355. He worked out with fellow LSU draft picks in the offseason and had a handful of weeks to get some sleep, fish and tweak his diet.\n\nIt wasn’t perfect: At the end of his 11-month stretch of baseball, he hit .208 in 20 games at Class AA Harrisburg. He called that time more mentally taxing than physically so. But he enjoyed the experience all the same. He has enjoyed his first days at camp, too. Seeing the fans was “really cool.”",

Also: Usher has friends.\n\nSuper Bowl commercials: Here are the best, worst and strangest commercials that played during Sunday night’s big game.\n\nTaylor Swift: Taylor Swift made it to the Super Bowl to support Travis Kelce and the Chiefs from the VIP suite.

  "text": "A line leading out of a little storefront at high noon or a busy parking lot might find me joining the ranks. If I smell something enticing coming out of a mom and pop, my tendency is to investigate the source of the aromas. Whenever I’m out of town and I’ve had a good meal, I ask the staff where else I should eat before I leave — never “What’s best?,” which too often lands you someplace fancy, but often, “Where do you dine on your off hours during the week?,” which feels more personal.\n\nOther times when people ask me where I get my tips, I respond by pointing at them: Readers and others are among my best sources. Thanks to my discerning friend Todd, I discovered a Japanese oasis above a Thai retreat in Washington. Another reader was worried that a rave of a vegetarian Vietnamese restaurant in Northern Virginia might bring in crowds, but he thought I needed to know about the newcomer anyway. And a proud mentor of a rising star in the exurbs let me know the young chef was ready for prime time at a restaurant of his own.\n\n“Forget about being serious,” she says. The design helps. Cheery pink blossoms frame the front picture window, and canary-yellow banquettes run along the sides of the walls, hung with illuminated branches. The setting is a fetching backdrop to a surprisingly long a la carte menu whose small-plate highlights include juicy pork belly and kabocha squash gyoza and tuna tartare — red with gochujang and fruity with apple — scooped up with nubby tempura seaweed chips. Did I mention the $5 beers, $7 drinks and $21 bottles of house wine at happy hour? Or the fact a server insisted on running to a neighboring restaurant to fetch mezcal after a customer requested a mezcal negroni? No wonder so many customers treat the space as a date night.\n\nThe food romances us, too, especially the well-priced omakase, or “chef’s choice.” A recent parade of dishes delivered one hit after another. One moment, we’re spooning into tofu whipped with radish, dashi and sake, a creamy base for blow-torched salmon glistening with orange roe. The next, we are scarfing folds of dewy hamachi wrapped around thread-thin fried potatoes, the soft and the crunch tied together with a hint of truffle oil. There are housemade pickles to escort wispy, panko-crusted pork tucked in its bowl with curry-kissed carrots and potatoes, distinctive sushi, and steaming red snapper broth to revive yourself at the end of six or so courses for $75 a diner.\n\nSome of the region’s most beloved dining destinations are found in small towns in Virginia. Think the Inn at Little Washington, the Restaurant at Patowmack Farm in Lovettsville and, since fall, Alias in Warrenton, an hour outside the District. The 30-seat newcomer is modeled after the intimate Three Blacksmiths in tiny Sperryville, which is where chef Stephen Burke worked with his wife, Kelly, before the couple opened a place of their own. Like Three Blacksmiths, Alias serves a tasting menu.\n\nLike the Sperryville attraction, the Warrenton restaurant also embraces a couple of hours of sublime entertainment, starting with snacks whose plates are as fetching as what they carry. Hope for sparkling ceviche in a fluted pastry shell on a scalloped gold plate, my first taste of a recent winter evening. Thoughtfully, Alias offers a vegetarian option along with its regular five-course menu. The best strategy is to order both and pass plates. Because the truffle-showered sliced roast chicken has an equal in housemade ravioli stuffed with pureed carrots lit with aji amarillo. Bread — a cross between French brioche and Japanese milk bread — gets its own course here, and the hot rolls are divine sops for the chef’s fine sauces.\n\nNoodles, definitely something with noodles, are in my future. Steaming knife-cut noodles, cooked to retain some bite, coil beneath a cover of crumbled pork, shot through with garlic and black vinegar, everything cooled with torn romaine lettuce. The kitchen, under the watch of chef-owner Hua Wang, makes its own liang pi, wheat-flour noodles. I wouldn’t think of leaving without a “burger,” or rou jia mo, either. The chewy bread is baked in-house, twice a day, and makes a great companion to a filling of crumbled lamb, warm with cumin, sweet with onion and hopping with jalapeños. Then there are dumplings to consider. Make mine pork dumplings draped with a creamy blanket of sesame seeds and lit with chile oil.\n\nThe owner is from Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province in China, where she ran a noodle restaurant before coming to the United States in 2007. Wang says she opened Northwest Chinese Food in 2015 as a way to introduce people to the food she ate and loved growing up in a part of China known for its bold flavors and Korean influences. Indeed, there’s housemade kimchi in the restaurant’s little market within the dining room, which also sells Chinese candy and snacks and three kinds of Wang’s chile oil.\n\nOne of the more dramatic ceviches in town, filed under “Joy” on the menu, finds red snapper and crunchy quinoa ringed in purple sweet potato puree and capped with what looks like meringue but is in fact a whip of coconut, fish bits and lemon juice playing the role of leche de tigre. A server tells us to “eat the parts separately, then together” for the full effect. Plump medallions of lamb loin are paired with a black rectangle of forbidden rice laced with bacon and plantains on a plate finished with a dollop of pureed black beans, feta and sour cream — my kind of dip — and an amber hot sauce sprung from chimichurri. The entree is among dishes labeled “Memories.” Useche says the categories underscore some of the guiding principles, including “Experience” and “Knowledge,” at Seven Reasons.",

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)Jackson Rutledge, Washington’s first-round pick in the 2019 MLB draft, opened the 2022 season with the low Class A Fredericksburg Nationals. That he was there at that point in his career spoke to progression that had been slowed and hindered by nagging injuries and — as a result — an inability to be available. Rutledge dropped off the radar nationally and fell in prospect rankings. He seemed lost in the shuffle. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news.But Rutledge stayed healthy enough to make 20 starts a year ago. The right-hander jumped to Class AA Harrisburg to begin this season and — after just 12 starts for the Senators — was recently called up to Class AAA Rochester, putting him just one step from the majors.“In order to pitch, you’ve got to be able to pitch,” Rutledge said last month. “So for me, not only really making every start but getting deep in every start, no matter what happens … just being a sort of a workhorse in the rotation is kind of what I pride myself on. That’s the goal I want to have as somebody who gets deep into every game and keeps it competitive every game gets us a chance.”Rutledge’s talent was never the question, but injuries tempered expectations about his future. He pitched 5⅓ innings of scoreless baseball in his second outing with Rochester on Tuesday, looking comfortable after a spotty first outing.“I try to just think about the next start,” Rutledge said about thinking too far ahead. “I think if I take care of my business here, then everything else is going to work itself out. I don’t really need to do anything other than what I’ve been doing if I can just continue this and be consistent. And that’s really what they’re looking for.”The Nationals already have Josiah Gray, MacKenzie Gore and Jake Irvin in the majors. But all three are early in their careers, so Washington will be careful to manage their workloads this year. The team might skip starts in the rotation late in the season, creating opportunities for other young arms. Rutledge, who was protected from the Rule 5 draft this offseason and placed on the 40-man roster, could be one of those guys.Rutledge — naturally intense and intentionally meticulous — considers each matchup in a game a chess match. Each pitch he throws sets him up not only for that at-bat against a hitter but for their rematch later in the game. Each swing gives him a glimpse into how hitters are seeing him and how he has to adjust.He keeps track of all of it using a new addition to his routine — a notebook that has a dual purpose. Before a start, he likes to take data from pregame scouting reports and translate it as he heads into a game. He can refer to the notebook between innings and add information as the game progresses. He also uses the notebook when he throws between starts. He wants to remember how he felt working on pitches and what he did during those sessions. He started this habit in the offseason after a few coaches recommended it and now encourages other teammates to do the same.Rutledge wanted to add a cutter to his arsenal to have a pitch that gets in on lefties’ hands, similar to what Gray did this offseason. But his cutter was acting like a slider — and Rutledge knows sliders aren’t good up the zone. So now his cutter has evolved into a slider used as a swing-and-miss pitch to righties. Rutledge said his original slider has morphed into a curveball he uses against lefties. He is now confident enough in his fastball command that he believes he can consistently throw it to lefties to make up for the lack of a cutter.“His breaking stuff, his curveball and slider, have both improved,” said De Jon Watson, the team’s director of player development. “And it’s really about the location and execution and really understanding where you are in that sequence of pitches. And I think that’s what he’s doing best, man. He’s understanding what he is and what the hitters are telling him, and he’s trying to execute off that information that he’s gaining.”Rutledge’s career path to the majors may not have always been smooth, but he seems to be back on track. How quickly Rutledge can adapt and take the next step in his development ultimately could determine when he gets a shot. But Rutledge doesn’t seem worried about his minor league numbers to this point. He’s worried about making sure he’s ready when the numbers really matter.“I think, for me, I don’t have the career minor league numbers that you would like,” Rutledge said. “But I’ve gotten so much better [in] the past two years. I think I’ve grown so much as a pitcher. That’s why you play in the minor leagues. You don’t play for career minor league stats. And so I’m trending upwards. I just want to continue to do that. So that’s all I’m really looking for.”The Lerners are holding on to the Nats. Here’s why that makes sense (for now).The Lerners are holding on to the Nats.

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nWalter Johnson put George Washington myth to the test with 1936 silver dollar tossOn Feb. 22, 1936, a crowd of thousands gathered at George Washington’s boyhood home near Fredericksburg, Va., to celebrate the 204th anniversary of his birth. The main attraction of the day’s festivities at Ferry Farm, which included the dedication of 200 cherry trees to be planted along the boulevard leading to Fredericksburg, took place at 2:30 that afternoon, when former Washington Senators pitching great Walter Johnson attempted to throw a silver dollar across the Rappahannock River. Legend had it Washington accomplished the feat as a young boy.Johnson, 48, who had been elected in the inaugural five-man class of the Baseball Hall of Fame earlier that month after resigning as manager of the Cleveland Indians the previous year, successfully cleared the river twice.“He threw it over with the same easy grace he once used in fanning Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker and ‘Ping’ Bodie, and so doing he brought to Fredericksburg something of that joy that was denied to Mudville when the mighty Casey struck out,” Edward T. Folliard, staff correspondent for The Washington Post, reported from the scene.Thanks to a politician’s bold wager and Johnson’s participation, the stunt — while doing little to clear up the veracity of the legend — sparked controversy and attracted national interest.The apocryphal tale of Washington throwing a silver dollar across the Rappahannock can be traced to Washington’s original biographer, Parson Weems, who attributed the story to one of Washington’s first cousins. In an 1826 essay, George Washington Parke Custis, Washington’s step-grandson, recounted the tale of Washington throwing a piece of slate roughly the size and shape of a dollar across the Rappahannock. In the legend’s retellings, the river was often changed to the Potomac.Johnson, who retired as a player in 1927 and went on to manage the Senators and Indians until 1935, was familiar with the tales of Washington’s physical prowess.“The famous story of throwing a silver dollar across the Potomac, true or fiction, indicates that Washington as a boy was highly respected as an athlete,” Johnson said in a 1932 interview with The Post, in which he added he would encourage his five children to enter the newspaper’s George Washington bicentennial essay contest.Four years later, Johnson accepted an invitation from Fredericksburg officials to attempt to reenact Washington’s feat on the father of this country’s birthday. He agreed to participate in the celebration, which was organized by the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce, under the conditions that someone else furnish the dollar and he wouldn’t be asked to wear a colonial costume.Virginia Gov. George C. Peery and other state officials were already scheduled to attend the celebration in Fredericksburg, but the event became a national fascination after New York Rep. Sol Bloom offered 20-1 odds that Johnson would not succeed in his attempt.Bloom, director of the George Washington Bicentennial Commission, believed the myriad myths about Washington, including the story of him chopping down a cherry tree, actually diminished his legacy. Bloom made it his mission to “explode all fallacies” about the first president, and in 1934 he wrote a book of questions and answers concerning Washington. In it, Bloom asserted that Washington didn’t throw an object across the Potomac or the Rappahannock.“Why, it’s preposterous,” Bloom told reporters. “It’s ridiculous. Not only is it physically impossible, but if you boil down the fable you’ll find that Washington was about 10 years old when the miracle was supposed to have happened.”In Fredericksburg, officials initially estimated the width of the Rappahannock at the point near Ferry Farm where Johnson would attempt his throw as between 350 and 375 feet. The longest baseball throw on record was 426 feet, by former major league outfielder Larry LeJeune at a 1910 contest in Cincinnati.“Maybe I can’t throw that far,” Johnson said, “but there’s one thing certain, if George Washington did it, I can.”Bloom was overwhelmed by phone calls and telegrams from people interested in taking him up on his wager, including Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce President Ben Pitts, who deposited a certified check for $5,000 in a local bank. Bloom sought to clarify the terms of the bet. According to him, the Rappahannock was closer to 1,500 feet across when Washington was a boy and had gradually become narrower in the intervening years. Bloom produced a London cable saying that measurements on Virginia maps in the British public record office listed the river as more than 1,300 feet wide in Washington’s day.“Maybe Johnson or someone else can throw a dollar over the river today, but they couldn’t do it over the river that ran by the farm in Washington’s day,” Bloom said. “And that’s my bet. Washington didn’t do it and no one else can. The bet still is open for anyone who can throw 1,300 feet.”“If Bloom wants Walter Johnson to throw a silver dollar 1,500 feet and the natives of Fredericksburg expect him to throw it 375 feet or less, it would appear that all bets are off,” The Post reported.Meanwhile, Johnson was training for the throw at his farm in Germantown, Md.“I am still practicing with a dollar against my barn door,” Johnson wrote to Fredericksburg officials. “Arm getting stronger, barn door getting weaker.”Two days before the celebration, Fredericksburg residents “showered bushels of iron washers” into the Rappahannock in failed attempts to reach the other side. Surveyors had calculated the span of the river where Johnson would attempt his throw as 272 feet. There was a buzz in town ahead of the Hall of Famer’s arrival.“Tense excitement pervaded this gayly bedecked little city tonight, on the eve of what promises to be a momentous test of an American legend,” the New York Times reported. “Some visitors arrived today, but the influx was nowhere near the proportions expected tomorrow forenoon. Local merchants are looking forward to a flourishing business when the visitors swell the town to twice or three times its normal population.”Johnson spent the day practicing on the Potomac River in D.C., and he reportedly tossed a silver dollar 300 feet. Bloom, who wouldn’t make the trip to Fredericksburg for Washington’s birthday celebration, sent Johnson a silver dollar coined in 1796 to use for the occasion.“Walter, there is no one in the world who wishes you more success tomorrow than I do at Fredericksburg when you will try to throw a silver dollar across the Rappahannock,” Bloom wrote. “After you have warmed up and have two strikes and three balls on the other fellow, use this dollar, because I believe that as the eagle on this dollar is in flight it might bring to you the good luck that millions of people throughout the country are wishing you, and the eagle in its flight might assist in carrying this across the Rappahannock.”On the big day, with Senators broadcaster Arch McDonald providing play-by-play from the muddy banks of the Rappahannock for a national audience on CBS Radio, Johnson made two practice throws. His first attempt fell about 10 feet shy of clearing the river. His second attempt was greeted with a cheer from the thousands of onlookers on the other side and sent a group of people scrambling after the souvenir.Pitts then handed Johnson a silver dollar for the official toss.“Johnson dug his toe in the mud, leaped forward a couple of times, whip-lashed his arm as he used to do in the old days, and the silver dollar sped across the Rappahannock,” The Post reported. “It glinted in the sun as it traveled. It landed against a gasoline tank and was picked up by Peter Yon, a stonemason.”“Well, that makes a bum out of Sol Bloom,” a local said.H.J. Eckenrode, a Virginia historian and the chief judge of the event, estimated the dollar traveled 317 feet. Bloom, who didn’t pay out any bets, sent Johnson another telegram.“Congratulations Walter,” he wrote. “Stop over in Washington on your trip home and let’s celebrate. I sincerely hope that my dollar is the dollar that did the trick.”Johnson had left Bloom’s coin at home. Instead, he tossed a Roosevelt dollar inscribed with “Walter Johnson threw this dollar across the Rappahannock River, February 22, 1936.”“The wind was against me, and I didn’t know whether I could make it or not,” Johnson said afterward. “… I’m glad I could prove George did it, especially after Sol Bloom made a campaign issue out of it.”The New York Times reported that only about 200 people stuck around for the dedication of the cherry trees.Folliard, who covered Johnson’s toss in Fredericksburg for The Post, went on to cover the White House and World War II for the newspaper and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1947. Years later, as documented by Shirley Povich, he told a crowd at the National Press Club that witnessing Johnson’s feat was among the highlights of his career.“As man and boy, that was my biggest thrill,” Folliard said. “You see, I was the fellow who held Walter Johnson’s coat.”The power and purpose behind Kali Reis’s ‘True Detective’ arrivalThe power and purpose behind Kali Reis’s ‘True Detective’ arrivalDoc Rivers is trying to rescue the Bucks and restore his reputationDoc Rivers is trying to rescue the Bucks and restore his reputationWhat to expect from Kliff Kingsbury’s offense?

  "text": "The Washington Nationals signed right-handed reliever Dylan Floro to a one-year deal Tuesday evening, adding an experienced arm to their bullpen. Floro, an eight-year veteran who turns 33 later this month, split time with the Miami Marlins and the Minnesota Twins in 2023 and has a career 3.42 ERA and 32 saves in 330 games. He struggled this year, posting a 4.76 ERA — the highest of his career for a full season.\n\nThe contract — for $2.25 million plus performance incentives, according to a person familiar with the terms — represents a low-stakes gamble that Floro will regain the form he had from 2018 to 2022, when he was an effective piece of bullpens for the Dodgers, Reds and Marlins. Perhaps his best season was 2021, when he posted a 2.81 ERA in 64 innings for Miami, striking out 62 while posting a WHIP of 1.219.\n\nThe Nationals also officially announced that they signed Nick Senzel to a one-year deal. Washington designated utility infielder Jeter Downs for assignment to clear room on its 40-man roster, which is now full.\n\nLast season, Manager Dave Martinez relied heavily on the late-inning trio of Kyle Finnegan, Hunter Harvey and Jordan Weems to help finish games. But outside of those three arms, the rest of the Nationals’ bullpen was inconsistent. General Manager Mike Rizzo was clear that he wanted to improve the bullpen this offseason.\n\n“Good, capable major league relievers that we could count on and not have such a split with our A group and our B group,” Rizzo said last week at the winter meetings. “I think that [Manager Dave Martinez] likes ... multi-inning pitchers, multi-out pitchers. Guys who can go back-to-back-to-back. And that’s difficult to do with young kids because we don’t want to push those guys three days in a row.”\n\nFloro is a prime bounce-back candidate and a veteran presence the Nationals are looking for at this point in their rebuild. His fielding independent pitching (FIP), which measures pitchers based on the events they have the most control over and doesn’t include balls put in play, was 2.96 in 2023 and provides hope that he will look more like the pitcher from the past. If he does, he could also become an attractive piece for a contender at the trade deadline.\n\nHarvey, Finnegan and Weems are likely to be in the bullpen with Floro next season, leaving four spots up for grabs. It’s been a rarity for the Nationals to enter the season with viable left-handed relief options but the Nationals have the luxury of two — Robert Garcia and Jose A. Ferrer, who showed flashes of success a year ago. The Nationals also have Mason Thompson, who was one of the team’s best relievers to open the season before fighting inconsistency while struggling with his mechanics.",

At what point is it too much?“I love to tinker,” Josiah Gray said. “I love to figure out what I can do with the baseball, just because of how the game is and how the seams of the baseball work.” (Saul Martinez for The Washington Post WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Washington Nationals right-hander Josiah Gray has always liked to tinker, going back to his days as a player at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, N. Y. The challenge was always finding ways to get better every day. He would implement new approaches. He would watch videos online about what to add or subtract from his game.Now, the 26-year-old has more resources at his disposal.“I love to tinker,” Gray said. “I love to figure out what I can do with the baseball, just because of how the game is and how the seams of the baseball work.”Baseball is a game of adjustments. Pitchers tweak their arsenals from season to season. They use in-season bullpen sessions to fine-tune their pitches. They alter their game plans. Anything to get an edge.Gray is no different. He added a cutter, a sinker and a sweeper to his repertoire last season. He dropped his four-seam fastball usage significantly from the previous year. He used two different windups to maintain a proper direction to the plate.Gray is coming off an all-star season in which he made significant strides. So now the question becomes: At what point does the tinkering stop? At what point will Gray find the right mix of pitches? And, if he keeps tinkering, will Gray ever find who he is as a pitcher?“You have to look at it in the big picture,” Nationals pitching strategist Sean Doolittle said. “[Just because] you feel a little off on a given day doesn’t necessarily mean you go into the video room and look to start tinkering with things. It’s hard to do as a player because you’re constantly trying to get better, constantly trying to make adjustments to stay ahead of the league.”Gray was exhausted after a long 2023 season. He spent most of October watching postseason baseball. Toward the end of the month, he felt the urge to get back to work. He had a strong first half, pitching to a 3.41 ERA. But his 1.435 WHIP signaled that a regression could come. He had a 4.76 ERA in the second half of the season. He cut his home runs per nine innings nearly in half from 2022 to 2023 but still walked more hitters per nine innings. So some more tinkering was necessary.Gray also changed his delivery in the final month of the 2023 season, starting it as if he was working out of the stretch. He plans to stick with that approach this season, saying it gives him more stability. But he likes certain aspects of his old delivery, so he could revert to the technique.Gray spent most of the offseason at a sports performance facility in Florida. Gray tweaked his sinker, hoping to generate more horizontal movement than vertical. He had a lot of success with his sinker in his final start of 2023 and wanted to build on it. He threw the sinker primarily to righties last season but wants to throw it more to lefties this year.“I kept on tinkering with it, and I think it’s in a good spot where I’ll roll it out early in games here and see what we’ve got,” said Gray, who is expected to make his first start of spring training Monday.Pitching coach Jim Hickey wanted Gray to throw his change-up more often. Gray altered his grip this offseason, widening his hands for more of a split change-up grip vs. a traditional change-up. He wants to release it off his fingers differently. The hope is that the change-up will have more drop.Gray said feedback from Nationals hitters in West Palm Beach will help determine whether the changes have helped. He wants to have multiple pitches at his disposal but also wants them to fit in his arsenal. Having an improved change-up or sinker doesn’t mean he has to significantly raise the usage of either pitch if it doesn’t fit into his game plan.Nationals Manager Dave Martinez wants Gray, who can deploy seven pitches, to develop three or four he can throw really well. One could argue that in order for Gray’s secondary pitches to be more effective, he needs to establish his four-seam fastball early in games. Gray threw his fastball 38.9 percent of the time in 2022, though it was often ineffective. Last season, that dropped to 17 percent.“I’m hoping that he understands coming in this spring who he is and what makes him really good,” Martinez said. “And I’m hoping that, by talking to him, that a lot of the tinkering is going to go away this year.”Josiah Gray tinkers with his game often.

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nFueled by Swifties, Super Bowl was most-watched telecast everThe made-for-TV romance between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift made for great TV ratings, too, fueling the largest telecast in history. (David Becker/AP)The Super Bowl that had it all — Taylor Swift in the stands, overtime on the field and Patrick Mahomes’s magic — was a hit with American viewers, too. CBS announced Tuesday that the game was the most-watched telecast ever with a total audience of 123.7 million, according to Nielsen data. The audience eclipses last year’s 115 million, which set the record before this season. The demographics for the telecast were not yet available, but pop star Swift’s presence in the stands surely provided an influx of younger, female viewers. The game itself was also riveting, ending in overtime with a game-winning drive by Mahomes and the Chiefs, who beat the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22.The figure is the total who watched on CBS, the Paramount Plus streaming platform, Univision and Nickelodeon, which showed an alternate telecast geared toward kids. The audience on CBS accounted for the vast majority with 120.3 million viewers.One caveat to the record is that several years ago Nielsen, the company that provides viewership data for linear television, began to count out-of-home viewing, introducing metrics for bars and parties. Total viewership numbers of sporting events have risen with the additional figure, making comparisons to previous years more difficult.The NFL continues to defy the trends of linear television, where viewership for big events has been declining in recent years. The Grammys this year averaged 12.5 million viewers, up from a year ago but a far cry from the show’s heyday. In 1984, for instance, it averaged 51.671 million when Michael Jackson won a record eight awards. The Oscars drew 18.7 million viewers last year, also up from the year before, but it hasn’t topped 40 million since 2014.Thirteen of the last 15 Super Bowls have generated more than 100 million viewers.The NFL’s regular season viewership was up 7 percent compared to last season, and several playoff games also set viewership records.Three best value bets to win the NCAA women’s basketball tournamentThree best value bets to win the NCAA women’s basketball tournamentTwo best value bets to win the NCAA men’s basketball tournament Two best value bets to win the NCAA men’s basketball tournament Even with new chefs, the Tabard Inn’s history outshines its foodKim Lai, co-founder of Four Sisters Vietnamese restaurant, dies at 77Sign in or create a free account to save your preferences",

  "text": "Less than five minutes into Saturday night’s game in Montreal, Washington Capitals defenseman Martin Fehervary skated slowly across the ice and headed down the tunnel. The quirks of Bell Centre’s layout, with the visiting team’s bench on the other side of the ice from the path to its dressing room, meant Fehervary had to wait for a stoppage in play to gingerly make his exit, aided by winger Anthony Mantha and athletic trainer Jason Serbus.\n\nBefore the first period ended, the Capitals had ruled out Fehervary for the rest of the game with a lower-body injury. Afterward, he was seen on crutches. The injury appeared to happen during Fehervary’s second shift, when he lost his edge behind Washington’s net and spun with his left leg caught beneath him as he fell awkwardly to the ice.\n\nIn a back-and-forth affair, the Capitals held on to beat the Canadiens, 4-3, despite playing with five defensemen for nearly the entire game. After the win, Coach Spencer Carbery praised his defenders, saying they “stepped up big-time tonight.”\n\n“Not something where it could be any day,” Carbery said. “It’s probably week-to-week, so whether it’s one, two, that’s what we’re looking at.”\n\nFor however long they’re without Fehervary, the Capitals have a hole to fill on the left side of their top defensive pairing. According to Natural Stat Trick, John Carlson and Fehervary have skated 473 minutes together this season in five-on-five play — more than 160 minutes more than the Capitals’ second-most-active pair, Rasmus Sandin and Trevor van Riemsdyk. Sandin and Carlson are the Capitals’ fourth-most-used combination at 270 minutes, so Carbery and assistant coach Mitch Love could reunite them starting with Tuesday night’s matchup against the New Jersey Devils at Capital One Arena.\n\nBut while Sandin and Carlson are effective together offensively, part of what makes Fehervary and Carlson work so well is Fehervary’s defensive impact. They’re often deployed against the opponent’s top line, and Fehervary’s skating and instincts allow him to remain well-positioned to defend when Carlson plays with a more freewheeling flair offensively.\n\n“[Losing Fehervary] is obviously a pretty big blow to the back end,” defenseman Nick Jensen said. “He covers a lot of minutes, covers a lot of ice out there with his skating ability. We typically have him going against their top lines. Going to be important, going down the stretch here, especially [Tuesday] against guys can skate with the puck like [Devils forwards Jesper] Bratt and [Jack] Hughes. We need guys that can keep up with them and their speed.”\n\nIn Fehervary’s absence Saturday, Jensen was on the ice for 26 minutes 7 seconds; it was the first time he played more than 25 minutes this season. Carlson played a team-high 29:07, van Riemsdyk played 21:53, Joel Edmundson played 21:42, and Sandin played 18:48. Only Sandin’s ice time was below his season average.\n\n“There’s some components of it where everyone’s getting in the mix a little more,” Jensen said. “Everyone’s kind of finding a groove a little bit more. I always find when guys go down, it is hard. If that night your team’s not going, you’re playing a lot in the [defensive] zone, it can be tough. But if the team’s playing well and you’re out there and you’re kind of finding that groove, you can kind of feed off that a little bit.”\n\nAlex Alexeyev and Ethan Bear were healthy scratches Saturday, and one of them presumably will return to the lineup Tuesday. As a left-handed shooter, Alexeyev could have the edge; adding him to the lineup, with Sandin potentially moving up to play with Carlson, wouldn’t require much shuffling.\n\nBut van Riemsdyk’s ability to play on the left, despite it being his off side, means the Capitals could move him over and bring in the right-handed-shooting Bear instead. That option forces more movement, but Carbery and Love have shown a preference for Bear over Alexeyev since Bear signed with the Capitals in December. Bear has played in 16 of the Capitals’ 20 games since he debuted Dec. 30; Alexeyev has made just three appearances in that span.\n\n“It hurts because Marty does a lot for us,” he said. “... But the good news is, [his absence] gives an opportunity for Al [and] Bearsy. We do have some depth there of guys that are champing at the bit to get into the lineup. We’ll rely on that for this foreseeable future.”",

  "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The Lerner family is no longer exploring a sale of the Washington Nationals, Mark Lerner, the club’s managing principal owner, told The Washington Post on Monday.“No. We have determined, our family has determined, that we are not going to sell the team,” Lerner said. Lerner said his family came to the decision “a while ago.”\n\nThe news comes after nearly two years of uncertainty for Washington’s MLB franchise, which won the World Series in 2019 but has been mired in a painful rebuild in the years since. In April 2022, Lerner announced his family would look into a sale of the team, saying it was an “exploratory process” with “no set timetable or expectation of a specific outcome.”\n\n“Nothing has really changed,” Lerner said Monday. “We’ve just decided that it’s not the time or the place for it. We’re very happy owning the team and bringing us back a ring one day.”\n\nIt is worth noting that a season ago, John Angelos — at the time the “control person” for the Baltimore Orioles, a term MLB uses to designate the lead decision-maker for each team — said he was not planning to sell his franchise. But last month, the Angelos family agreed to a deal that would cede control of the Orioles to a group led by David Rubenstein. For now, Lerner has made his family’s intentions clear.\n\nOn Monday, Washington hosted a cookout for fans to meet players and coaches at the team’s spring training facility. Lerner attended with his wife, Judy, as well as other members of the ownership group.\n\nSome fans at the event were hopeful that the Lerners’ decision would lead to spending on the major league roster in the near future. Others were skeptical.\n\n“I hope now that we’ll be able to put some money up for quality players,” said Phil Goldman, 71, who has had a season ticket plan since 2005, the team’s first year in D. C. “I don’t know that it’s going to be this year, but that’s good. I enjoy having the Lerners as owners. I thought they did a good job.”\n\n“I think they’re probably due for some change,” said Tom Carlon, 41. “I’m not sure if they know what direction this team wants to go, if they want to spend or develop their young guys. It’s somewhere in between. I know they’ve been getting a lot of flak previously.”\n\nThe Nationals have endured four straight losing seasons since their 2019 World Series title, the city’s first since 1924. In 2021, the team began to dramatically reshape its roster, trading ace Max Scherzer and shortstop Trea Turner to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next season, Washington sent superstar Juan Soto to the San Diego Padres.\n\nIn return, the Nationals have been infused with young talent that is in various stages of development. Catcher Keibert Ruiz and right-hander Josiah Gray, an all-star last season, arrived as part of the deal with the Dodgers. Lefty MacKenzie Gore and shortstop CJ Abrams were part of the Soto trade. Washington’s much-improved farm system is now headlined by outfielder Dylan Crews, the No. 2 pick in last year’s draft, and James Wood, a 6-foot-6 slugger acquired from the Padres.\n\nLerner’s comments Monday were brief, and questions remain. Among the biggest: How much will the family commit to the team financially now that it is no longer exploring a sale?",

  "text": "Donald Trump is the overwhelming polling leader for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, even as he faces four criminal indictments. But several GOP rivals are holding out hope for an upset through strong showings in the first states set to vote.\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Biden is seeking reelection and heavily favored to win, despite two lesser-known challengers. Independent or third-party candidates such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., are longshots but could sway a close general election matchup.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses kicked off the presidential nominating process on Jan. 15.\n\nRepublicans have rallied to the former president’s side as he faces growing legal peril – accused in court of falsifying business records, mishandling classified documents and unsuccessfully attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Some trials are scheduled to play out as GOP voters are still selecting their nominee -- though the proceedings could be delayed. Trump has used the criminal investigations to his political benefit in the primary, vowing “retribution” for his enemies and resurging from a moment of vulnerability after the 2022 midterms.\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who later served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, seized new attention this fall with her debate performances, and many Republicans now view her as the most viable alternative to Trump. She’s surged toward Trump in New Hampshire, where she’s running on a traditional Republican platform but has also enticed moderates and independents as she calls for a new, younger generation of leaders. But to many in the GOP she embodies an older incarnation of the party that Trump shattered.\n\nFormer Texas congressman Will Hurd ended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in October and endorsed Haley. He launched his campaign declaring that if Republicans nominate “a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump... we all know Joe Biden will win again.” The ex-CIA officer was known in Congress for his willingness to work with Democrats and is now making a longshot pitch for his more moderate brand of what he calls “common-sense leadership.\"\n\nMike Pence ended his campaign in October after struggling to gain traction among Republican voters – many of whom faulted him for defying Trump’s pressure to reject the results of the 2020 election. Pence served as vice president under Trump and embraced his agenda but broke with him on Jan. 6, 2021, refusing to interfere with the certification of Biden’s electoral win. He grew more critical of Trump during his presidential bid, suggesting his former running mate is unfit for office. But he still indicated he would back Trump if he wins the GOP nomination.\n\nBiden is seeking reelection, saying he wants to “finish the job” he started when the country was besieged by a deadly pandemic, a reeling economy and a teetering democracy. Polling shows that many Democrats would prefer a nominee other than Biden in 2024, and at 80 he is the oldest president in U. S. history to seek a second term. But major Democratic leaders have not taken steps to challenge him, and his party’s better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterms helped quiet critics.\n\n[How Democrats across the country feel about Biden 2024]\n\nRep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) announced a long-shot primary challenge to President Biden in 2024. While Phillips’s political views are broadly aligned with those of Biden, Phillips has for months called on Biden to allow another Democrat to lead the Democratic ticket in 2024. “I’m representing what I believe to be the majority of the country that wants to turn the page,” Phillips said recently on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Tired of the meanness and the fearmongering of Donald Trump. I would like to see Joe Biden, a wonderful and remarkable man, pass the torch, cement this extraordinary legacy.”\n\nActivist and self-help author Marianne Williamson is waging a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination. Williamson is positioning herself to Biden’s left, advocating tuition-free higher education at public institutions, among other initiatives. She also ran for president in 2020, calling for “a moral and spiritual awakening” in the United States, and dropped out shortly before the first nominating contests. “We need to offer fundamental economic reform. Nothing short of that will beat the Republicans in 2024,” she told The Post in an interview.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a controversial member of the storied Kennedy family who is known for his anti-vaccine views, parlayed his famous last name into years of advocacy as an environmental lawyer and best-selling author. In recent years, however, he has become better-known as one of the country’s most prominent opponents of vaccines and peddled false claims linking them to autism. He gained even more notoriety during the pandemic while spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines.\n\nAzi Paybarah, Michael Scherer, Tyler Pager, Maeve Reston, Toluse Olorunnipa, Mariana Alfaro, Meryl Kornfield, Maegan Vazquez and John Wagner contributed to this report.

  "text": "But as life has flowed back into downtowns, so have the two-wheelers. In the United States, 156 U. S. cities from New York to Washington offer ride-share e-scooter systems. Rides are increasing again. The former transportation chief in the nation’s capital, Everett Lott, has called them “a fundamental part” of the city’s transportation network. Seventeen percent of D.C. residents say they use them.\n\nWhether you love them or hate them, the scooters are coming. Here’s what you need to know to decide whether to hop on — or get out of the way.\n\nIf you live near a big city, you’re aware of the perennial problem of too many cars in too little space. That’s only getting worse. The number of hours Americans spend stuck in traffic has more than doubled since the 1980s, topping 99 hours per year, with no end in sight. Every additional minute commuting behind the wheel correlates to poorer health for us and the planet. Long car commutes are associated with higher blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, greater obesity, more heart attacks and even premature births — not to mention emissions.\n\nScooters, like bicycles and e-bikes, promise to give you back some of those hours. They take up much less space than a car, and unlike the bus, they take you exactly where you want to go with minimal searching for parking. On short trips, they can radically shrink the time to get around a city: Most scooter and bike trips are short — around 15 minutes and 1.5 miles. Nearly half — 45 percent —   replace taxi or personal vehicle trips, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, an association of 100 major North American cities and transit agencies.\n\nScooters were no different. Cities were unprepared. The technology was new. Safety precautions were lax. Riders were inexperienced. One former New York City Department of Transportation engineer described the vehicles’ frenzied deployment as compressing more than a decade of changes to people’s travel habits into just two to three years.\n\nThat’s taken a toll. Last year, reports the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,  50,000 out of  over about 50 million scooter rides ended with a trip to the emergency room. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an industry group, found e-scooter riders sustained more injuries per mile than bicyclists — although their novelty may have played a role. A whopping 40 percent of those hurt reported being on their first ride, and 98 percent wore no helmet.\n\nThe scooters themselves are changing: Many are now built to last five years (compared with two months for their predecessors), and employ sensors and software to avoid accidents, similar to those in self-driving cars. If a rider is on the sidewalk or breaking local rules, companies can slow or disable the vehicle remotely. Self-driving software repositions misplaced vehicles automatically.\n\nThat’s good news for the climate, argues Noah Horesh, a research scientist at Colorado State University who conducts transportation life-cycle analyses. He’s looked at the emissions generated to get you from point A to point B in different vehicle types, starting from mining metal ore to manufacturing to the last tick of their odometer. His findings are not what you might expect.\n\nTransit buses, for example, generate higher emissions than all other fuel-powered vehicles because the average ridership in the United States is low, even though they are designed to move dozens of people (but deliver other benefits, since rapid transit disproportionately helps people escape poverty and avoid homelessness). Trains, especially subways and commuter rail running on electricity, meanwhile, perform considerably better because they transport larger numbers of people efficiently.\n\nBut scooters win over all listed vehicles. Thanks to their diminutive and efficient design, they can turn electrons into enormous numbers of miles with no tailpipe emissions. As the electric grid continues to decarbonize, scooters’ emissions will shrink further. (Because bicycles and e-bikes include life-cycle emissions from food and agriculture with fossil fuels, they weren’t included in this chart.)\n\nMillions do rely on them, however, and millions more are likely to join them. As one San Francisco city supervisor said, “the genie is out of the bottle,” and scooters are bound to become even more tightly woven into the fabric of urban life.\n\nThe reflexive reaction to the scooter wars is to retreat into questions of identity: Are you anti-car or anti-scooter? A better question is how to maximize everyone’s freedom to get around. That  can get us thinking not  only about new forms of transportation, but how we want to live: Behind the wheel — or walking, scooting, pedaling, hovering and other manners of conveyance we’ve yet to imagine.\n\nThe Netherlands is an instructive example. More than a quarter of trips in the country are made by bike. The country didn’t enable this by banning cars, says Adie Tomer, an urban economics and infrastructure policy expert at Brookings Metro. It did it by making traveling by bicycle as safe and accessible as by car. Then people could choose.",
