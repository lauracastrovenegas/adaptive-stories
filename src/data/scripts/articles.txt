Description: Militants entered Israel in at least five places, videos verified by The Post show.

Content: Palestinian fighters breached the Gaza border in at least five places on Saturday in the deadliest incursion into Israel in decades, and appeared to catch Israeli soldiers by surprise in dawn assaults on fortified installations, according to videos verified by The Washington Post. The videos, released by Hamas on social media, showed militants using explosives and other means to breach Israel’s border fence with Gaza, then driving and jogging, sometimes for several miles, to attack weakly guarded military posts and towns, where they killed and captured Israeli soldiers and civilians.

Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the assault, which began while Israel was observing a religious holiday that falls the day after the festival of Sukkot. The groups also launched more than 3,000 rockets, the Israel Defense Forces said. At least 700 people in Israel were killed and thousands wounded, Israeli media said on Sunday.

At least 67 Palestinians were killed during strikes Monday in Rafah that the Israeli military described as providing cover for the rescue of two hostages.For context: Understand what’s behind the Israel-Gaza war.The videos verified by The Post showed scores of fighters breaching the border with little opposition, armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. They poured into Israel on the ground, flew in with fan-driven paragliders and used commercial drones to attack Israeli military targets, including tanks and communications infrastructure.One video shows fighters from Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, using explosives against a section of border wall near the Erez crossing, the only one available for Gazans to travel into Israel, located at the northern end of the Gaza Strip. The video shows at least seven gunmen running toward the crossing, moving through a security checkpoint and firing at a guard tower.

In the video, a fighter shoots a bloodied body on the ground in a hallway as he catches up with a group of other militants, who appear to be capturing two men clothed in only shorts and T-shirts. Later in the video, as the fighters clear hallways and living quarters, several other bodies can be seen on the ground. It was not clear from their clothing if they were in the military.

Another video filmed at sunrise shows fighters on foot and motorcycles passing through an opening made in the border fence near Kerem Shalom, a kibbutz on Israel’s southern border with Egypt near a major border crossing of the same name. The video then cuts to the fighters storming a military outpost about three miles to the north.

Skip to end of carouselHow we verify videos of the Israel-Gaza warThe Post only publishes verified videos of the Israel-Gaza war. Verification takes rigorous reporting, fact-checking and collaboration to make sure a video hasn’t been manipulated, either through missing context, deceptive editing or malicious transformation. Here’s how we do it:1. We geolocate the video by cross-referencing distinctive landmarks in the footage with reliable source material such as satellite imagery or Google Earth.2. We translate any dialogue in the video to see if there are context clues.3. We investigate when the video was recorded, using metadata, time stamps and the position of the sun. Other visuals, official statements, eyewitness testimony and audio also provide context that help corroborate videos.3. We review the uploader’s account and try to find the original source for the video.4. We consult with military experts when weapons and military equipment may be clues about what transpired.5. We screen for fake videos by examining whether there are jump cuts, interrupted audio, or visuals and audio that doesn’t match.6. We run a reverse-image search and look for other posts on the same topic to make sure it is not an old video — perhaps even from a different conflict — that is recirculating.Once the fighters reached Be’eri, nearly three miles from the Gaza border, other videos, including one posted on X (formerly Twitter) showed them dragging at least five people away. Two appear to be older and thinly dressed, and all are barefoot, with their hands tied behind them.

Israeli and Hamas officials both confirmed that Israeli military personnel and civilians were taken captive across southern Israel during the assault, though the total number and their condition is unknown. A spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing said there were “tens” of soldiers and officers in the group’s custody, a Reuters journalist in Gaza reported. The Israeli Embassy in the United States posted on X that there were 100 “kidnapped civilians and soldiers.”

In Nahal Oz, less than a mile from where fighters breached the border fence, they stormed a military base and used a commercial drone to drop an explosive on Israeli soldiers standing near an ambulance. The videos from the base showed fighters taking female prisoners.

Palestinian fighters also managed to reach Sderot, a town of about 30,000 people roughly three miles from the Erez crossing in north Gaza. Images from Sderot showed more than a half-dozen civilians bloodied and slumped around a bus stop in the city, and videos showed armed men in a pickup truck firing at an Israeli police vehicle.

The Saturday assault took place under the cover of a large rocket barrage that began at about 6:30 a.m. and was aimed at cities across Israel. The Post verified footage taken in the aftermath of several reported strikes, including in Tel Aviv and the southern city of Netivot. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said the “overwhelming majority” of Israeli casualties resulted from close-contact shooting, not rockets.

Gaza was plunged into darkness on Saturday evening after Israel cut off its electricity and launched waves of airstrikes into the enclave. The Israeli air force hit what it described as 17 military compounds and four operational command centers belonging to Hamas. Footage taken Saturday showed the destruction of a 14-story residential building in Gaza City known as the Palestine Tower.

Description: At least 260 bodies have been recovered from the site of a trance music festival in Israel, one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their surprise attack Saturday.

Content: The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re’im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.

At least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.

The attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. “The event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,” ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.

The festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.

Ben Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. “I took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,” she said. “The people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.”

They drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.

On Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.

Argamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. “If she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn’t have gone, but we knew nothing,” Marciano said. “She wasn’t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, ‘Go; you’re young.’ I regret that.”

In the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, “Allahu akbar!” A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair.

Headline: Israel massed troops in the West Bank. Then Hamas attacked from Gaza.

Description: “Israel made a huge mistake believing that a terror organization can change its DNA,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser. “We will not make it again.”

Content: Three days after the deadliest attack in Israeli history, with at least 900 dead, the country is on the cusp of a long and bloody war in Gaza. More than 300,000 reservists have been called up to serve. But the capacity of Israel’s military, long revered here as a source of stability, suddenly feels like a question mark. Equally unclear is the end game for Netanyahu — with his Gaza containment strategy in ruins, some are calling for a full reoccupation of the territory.

Security experts say the war is the result of severe intelligence and military failures. Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been training for weeks near the Israeli border — drilling in rocket launches, kidnapping soldiers and “storming settlements,” Gazan media reported. Yet the assessment from the Israeli military was that Hamas had no appetite for another conflict, a line repeated by trusted media figures.

“The good news in the context of the Gaza Strip is that neither Israel nor Hamas want to see hostilities escalate, each for its own reasons,” columnist Yoav Limor wrote last month in the right-wing newspaper Israel Hayom.

Aharon Zeevi Farkash, former head of  the Israel Defense Forces’ military intelligence branch, told Israeli radio station Reshet Bet that “after we are able to probe this, we will see that we knew almost everything. There were intelligence assessments hours before. The question is, did we understand what we knew?”

The IDF issued rare public statements in recent months, warning that military deterrence was deteriorating. Netanyahu and radical members of his cabinet derided the officials as part of the protest movement, and the protesters as “anarchists,” asserting that the status quo with the Palestinians would hold.

“The modus vivendi was that Hamas takes care of Gaza, Israel allows it to prosper, with the relatively small price that Israel paid every so often, with a round of violence in which Israel would kill thousands of Palestinians and Palestinians would kill dozens of Israelis — that was considered the best Israel could hope for,” said Eran Etzion, former deputy head of Israel’s national security council. “Now that strategic equation has been completely violated.”

“The chaos that has been going on in the past year has created a situation that we’re in now, of putting out fires,” Brik said. “A terror attack here, a terror attack there. They’re not dealing with building the army.”

Israel’s chaotic and delayed response to the multipronged assault was shocking to Israelis, who watched helplessly on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath and the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, as civilians in the south were left to fend for themselves against Hamas gunmen. Entire families were killed. Children and the elderly were taken to Gaza as hostages.

The surprise attack started around 6 a.m., with a barrage of rocket fire followed by cross-border attacks. Yet it wasn’t until late afternoon that buses and trains were mobilized to ferry soldiers south. It took some 10 hours for the first troops to arrive in towns overrun by militants.

The Gaza border, it soon became clear, was minimally manned, and it took hours to redirect units stationed in the West Bank, which has been the main area of focus for the military this year. Palestinian militancy has surged in the occupied territory, from Jenin to Jericho, and Israeli raids have been increasingly common and deadly. Some in Netanyahu’s far-right government had called to annex the West Bank. Gaza, by contrast, appeared stable.

“There was a need for more soldiers, so where did they take them from? From the Gaza border, where they thought it was calm,” said Farkash, the former IDF military intelligence chief. “Not surprising that Hamas and Islamic Jihad noticed the low staffing at the border.”

Hamas, designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, assumed power in Gaza in 2007 after Israel withdrew. For years, the group has been digging tunnels, amassing rockets and threatening to take hostages, part of a wider plan to “liberate Palestine.” It has publicly increased its cooperation with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, which has stepped up its provocations in recent months along Israel’s northern border.

As Israel grapples with the fallout from the attack, many in the south still feel isolated and alone. Much of the most reliable information on the situation there continues to come from citizen networks rather than military officials, who on Monday asserted that towns in the south were “recaptured” despite ongoing fighting with militants.

Gaya Calderon, who texted with her 16-year-old sister moments before she, their brothers and their father were abducted by militants and taken to the Gaza Strip, said that she and other relatives of hostages have received no help or guidance — either from the army or the government.

The Ottoman Empire had controlled that part of the Middle East from the early 16th century until control of most of the region was granted to the British after World War I.

Both Israelis and Palestinians were struggling for self-determination and sovereignty over the territory, developing respective movements for their causes.

As World War I began, several controversial diplomatic efforts — some contradicting each other — by the Great Powers tried to shape the map of the modern Middle East, including the Palestinian territories. Palestinians cite a series of letters in 1915 to 1916 between Mecca’s emir and the British high commissioner in Egypt, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, as outlining a promise of an independent Arab state.

In 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly negotiated between Britain and France planned to carve up the Middle East into spheres of influence, and determined that the land in question was to be internationalized.

In 1917, Britain’s foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, expressed his government’s support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” in a letter to Baron Walter Rothschild, the head of the British wing of the influential European Jewish banking family.

To Israelis, the missive marks a formal utterance of the Israeli state’s right to exist; to Palestinians, it was an early sign of their dispossession. The declaration also noted that it was “clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” nodding to the overwhelming majority Arab population in the region at the time. (About 90 percent of the population was Muslim in 1850, and about 80 percent in 1914.)

Large-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Both sides continued to assert their right to establish a state.

Headline: Fate of more than 100 Israeli hostages consumes, unifies a terrorized nation

Description: The families of more than 100 Israelis thought be held captive inside Gaza are growing ever more desperate for information as full-scale war looms.

Content: The scene is being re-created across the country, as the families of more than 100 Israelis thought to be held captive inside of Gaza grow ever more desperate for information. In the absence of a government response, they are dreading the one most likely: a massive military operation, which they fear could put their loved ones in the firing line.

Some families have already had their worst fears confirmed. Videos reviewed Monday by The Washington Post showed evidence that at least four people in the town of Be’eri were killed soon after being taken captive by Hamas.

But none of the previous episodes, experts say, compares with the mass kidnapping of children, grandparents and whole families, much of it captured on video and shared on social media. And none of the options the government may be considering are likely to end without more bloodshed, they said.

“This is unprecedented. We’ve never had so many people taken and held in a hostile territory,” said Gershon Baskin, Israel’s back-channel negotiator in the Shalit case. “It’s a new reality, and it’s difficult to measure how society will respond to this.”

Hamas has said the hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations. Ahmed Abdul Hadi, Hamas’s representative in Lebanon, denied reports that the group was in talks with Qatar over a prisoner exchange: “There is nothing like that right now at all,” he told The Post on Monday. “It’s too early for this conversation.”

Israel’s intelligence in Gaza was thought to be effective until Saturday’s surprise attack, but even before that, Hamas had proved its determination to conceal hostages. On the day Shalit was released, the militants sent out more than 30 decoy vehicles, Baskin said. The captive wasn’t in any of them.

The multipronged attack, in which at least 800 people were killed, shattered Israel’s shaky but enduring coexistence with Hamas. The regular rocket launches and periodic wars were largely deemed an acceptable price for otherwise containing the militant group. Now the country appears unified in calling for a major military intervention, whatever the costs.

“I think the Israeli public, from the far left to the far right, feels that the price of coexistence with Hamas is intolerable,” Orbach said.

Both experts thought a small-scale hostage deal was possible — the exchange of children, elderly and sick Israelis for female and ill Hamas prisoners, for example. But neither thought the hostages would keep Israel from launching an overwhelming attack on Gaza.

“The public wants to go into Gaza and attack Hamas,” Orbach said. “The public also wants the hostages to be safely rescued. I don’t think they’ve come to terms with the inherent contradiction.”

Yaffa Adar, a resident of Nir-Oz, a kibbutz just miles from the Gaza border, last made contact from her basement at 9 a.m. Saturday, the day the family had plans to gather for the Sukkot holiday: “There are terrorists in the road,” she texted them.

Description: Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport remains open, but several airlines are stopping flights for at least a few days.

Content: Some countries have announced evacuation plans for citizens in Israel using government or military airplanes. Some Israeli citizens abroad are also trying to get home in light of the growing conflict but are unable to find flights into Tel Aviv due to the widespread cancellations.

In a security alert Monday, the U. S. Embassy in Israel advised Americans in Gaza “who wish to leave and can do so safely” to check the status of Rafah Crossing,” which is the sole border crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. U.S. citizens and eligible family members in Israel, a Sunday alert said, should contact the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem or consulate in Tel Aviv for assistance using their crisis intake form.

Israel’s national airline, El Al, released an update on Monday afternoon local time saying flights were still operating as scheduled, but all flights out of Tel Aviv were leaving from a single terminal. Travelers who would not be taking scheduled flights have the option to request travel vouchers online. The airline is also waiving change fees for certain flights before Oct. 21.

Delta Air Lines is canceling its flights through Tel Aviv for the rest of October, the company said in an emailed statement early Monday evening. “Our hearts are with those who are impacted as our people work to find safe alternatives for customers trying to depart TLV,” the statement said.

Delta will communicate specific flight changes to customers through the Fly Delta app. The airline also said it “will continue to explore options for customers to safely exit TLV via seats that become available on our partner airlines.”

American Airlines has canceled all flights through Tel Aviv through Dec. 4. The company issued a travel alert with additional information on customer flexibility, including change fee waivers for flights through Oct. 21. “We continue to monitor the situation with safety and security top of mind and will adjust our operation as needed,” the airline said. Customers, it added, should visit aa.com or the airline’s mobile app for additional information on specific flights.

As of Sunday, Air Canada has also canceled flights to Tel Aviv through Oct. 12. Those with scheduled travel can either change their flight free of charge to another date through Oct. 30, or cancel and receive a full refund, according to an airline update.

In a statement posted to its website Wednesday, British Airways said it is suspending its flights to and from Tel Aviv. The carrier said it will provide customers with options “including a full refund or rebooking with another airline.”

EasyJet said any customers who were affected by cancellations would be eligible for a voucher, refund, or free change to a different flight. Customers with upcoming travel plans are being encouraged to reach out to the airline directly. “Due to the situation we understand that some customers traveling in the coming days may no longer wish to travel,” the airline said.

Virgin Atlantic has canceled certain flights for Tel Aviv through Oct. 11 but maintains a daily flight to and from London Heathrow. “Due to the evolving situation in Israel, some of our flights to and from Tel Aviv may face delays or cancellations,” a spokesperson said. Travelers who wish to change plans can also change their flights without a fee through at least Oct. 21, or ask for a full refund.

Air France, in accordance with French and Israeli authorities, is suspending all services in Tel Aviv until further notice, per an update on the airline’s website. Flights to and from Tel Aviv have been canceled through at least Tuesday.

Headline: The ‘high tide of American antisemitism’ makes Israel attacks foreboding
Publish Date: Monday, October 09, 2023 at 11:30 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/09/israel-hamas-attacks-antisemitism-america-jewish-communities/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13 
Description: After a historic level of antisemitic acts in America last year, local Jewish communities are on edge after the attacks in Israel.

Content: “Immediately, as we woke up to the news on Saturday, we talked to law enforcement,” said Meredith Weisel, the regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the D. C. area. “We have requested that they continue to increase patrols of Jewish institutions.”

Antisemitic incidents in the United States reached historic levels in 2022 — the highest since the ADL began collecting data in 1979, according to its  audit. (Disturbingly, I wrote a similar line when the Jewish Community Center in Fairfax County was covered in 19 swastikas overnight in 2018. The number of acts is exponentially growing.)

And against that backdrop — a domestic hostility that has steadily increased year after year — the massacre in Israel feels palpable and even foreboding here in America, where hatred of Jews is very real.

While American Jews like her who remember the 1973 Yom Kippur War may have felt an existential threat when Israel was attacked back then, it wasn’t as personal and immediately menacing as the Hamas attack today.

“I don’t know, I just grew up in a part of Chicago where most people got along,” she said. “There were signs at restaurants and country clubs that said ‘Members Only,’ and we knew that meant ‘No Jews.’ But swastikas? It wasn’t like that.”

For one thing, there was no information highway to spread the hate so quickly back then. Already, monitors at the ADL are seeing an uptick in hate speech and threats online, Weisel said. The group’s website has resources for people who want to help.

“We are definitely worried that here in the U. S. and here in our region,” she said, “when something happens in Israel, we see it repeated here.”

“I am a runner; I happened to be out running early in the morning,” she said, and she saw swastikas and “KKK” scrawled all over the place where her family worships in Gaithersburg, Md., the Shaare Torah synagogue. “It stopped me dead in my tracks. It was horrible. This is a place that my kids call a second home. They went to preschool there.”

Those are the images that come to mind as her family hears the news from Israel and as the incidents across the nation grow, at the same time books about the Holocaust — among them “Night” by Elie Wiesel, “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank and “Maus,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel by Art Spiegelman — are being banned from school libraries.

Just days after that massacre, D. C. police arrested a man who said he supported that attack. Jeffrey “Raph” Clark, a guy born in D.C. who went to liberal, local schools, had a basement full of nooses, ammo, armored vests and a sketch of someone with a gun aimed at the head of a bearded man wearing a yarmulke.

Clark alarmed his family when he defended the synagogue massacre. On Gab, he called the shooter a hero and said, of those killed, that “every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,” according to court documents. (Clark was sentenced to time served after serving almost 10 months for a federal gun charge.)

According to a spreadsheet showing hate incidents in Montgomery County in March, kids have found swastikas scrawled on desks, drawers, doors, tables and chairs. A child found one on a piece of paper stuffed into his backpack. There was a tiny one on the edge of a Jenga block. Many in bathrooms. This was just one month.

He knows there are kids who have family members and friends in Israel who are unaccounted for. He’s hoping the schools will be proactive in helping these students with counseling and messaging, for both Jewish and Muslim students who may be within the emotional blast radius of events happening far from home.

Headline: Hamas received weapons and training from Iran, officials say

Description: Iran is ‘broadly complicit’ in supporting Palestinian militants, but no evidence seen of a direct role in slaughter, officials say.

Content: Hamas, the Gaza-based Palestinian militant organization that led the attack, has historically maintained a degree of independence from Tehran compared with true Iranian proxy groups such as the Lebanese-based Hezbollah. But in recent years, Hamas has benefited from massive infusions of Iranian cash as well as technical help for manufacturing rockets and drones with advanced guidance systems, in addition to training in military tactics — some of which occurred in camps outside Gaza, the officials said.

U. S. and Israeli officials said they have no firm evidence so far that Iran authorized or directly coordinated the attack that killed more than 900 Israelis and wounded thousands. But current and former intelligence officials said the assault bore hallmarks of Iranian support, and noted officials in Tehran have boasted publicly about the huge sums in military aid provided to Hamas in recent years.

“If you train people on how to use weapons, you expect them to eventually use them,” said a Western intelligence official who, like others interviewed, requested that his name and nationality be withheld to freely discuss the rapidly unfolding events in southern Israel. The official, and a second Western analyst with access to sensitive intelligence, said the analysis conducted in the wake of the attack pointed to many months of preparation by Hamas, beginning at least as early as mid-2022.

In interviews, more than a dozen intelligence analysts and military experts expressed astonishment at the stealth and sophistication of the Hamas assault, which involved coordinated raids across the Israeli border by hundreds of gunmen traveling by land, sea and air — including motorized paragliders. The ground offensive was accompanied by swarms of rockets and drones that began streaking across the border early Saturday, hitting targets with a degree of precision not seen in previous Hamas attacks. While the Palestinian group has a capable militia and indigenous assembly lines for rockets and drones, an attack of Saturday’s scale would have been extremely challenging without considerable outside help, analysts said.

“The amount of training, logistics, communication, personnel, and weapons required provides a massive footprint,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA senior operations officer who served in counterterrorism roles in the Middle East. “This suggests both Iranian involvement, given the complexity of the attack, and highlights the colossal intelligence failure.” The use of paragliders — reminiscent of a spectacular 1987 attack by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Israel that killed several soldiers — “surely required training outside of Gaza,” Polymeropoulos said.

Jonathan Finer, the White House’s deputy national security adviser, said in an interview with CBS News: “What I can say without a doubt is that Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks. Iran has been Hamas’s primary backer for decades. They have provided them weapons. They have provided them training. They have provided them financial support. And so, in terms of broad complicity, we are very clear about a role for Iran.”

Iran denied a direct role in Saturday’s attack, while also praising the Hamas militants who carried it out. “We are not involved in Palestine’s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself,” Tehran’s mission to the United Nations said in a statement released Monday. But other Iranian officials publicly celebrated the attack while highlighting their close relationship with Hamas.

Current and former intelligence officials confirmed that Iran had provided technical help to Hamas in manufacturing the more than 4,000 rockets and armed drones launched into Israel since Saturday. At least some Hamas militants also have undergone training in advanced military tactics, including at Lebanese camps staffed by technical advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the officials said.

“It’s a ‘train the trainer’ approach,” Knights said. “You don’t have to do a lot to train someone to be capable of operating a drone system, which is not complicated stuff anymore.” On the other hand, he said, the combined-arms breaching capability exhibited during Saturday’s assault “clearly was practiced and carefully planned somewhere. A whole bunch of fortified positions fell to sophisticated combined arms-breaching attacks. And you don’t just wing that.”

Michael Eisenstadt, director of the Washington Institute’s Military and Security Studies Program, said that the relationship with Iran developed as a result of the Oslo peace process in the early 1990s when Tehran was looking for ways to scuttle efforts to forge a peace deal between the Palestinians and Israel. That was when Iran first provided the know-how for the explosive belts used by Palestinian suicide bombers.

The suicide bombing campaigns by both Hamas and Islamic Jihad had a “significant impact” on the peace process, he said. Hamas launched its first homemade rocket, the Qassam, in 2001 during the second intifada. But it was very rudimentary, using pipes and a homemade fuel mixture derived from sugar and other common components.

“Iran over the years has provided a lot of assistance to Hamas in terms of rocket capability,” Eisenstadt said. “The signature weapon of Iran proxies are rockets, and increasingly missiles. You see that everywhere — with Iraq, Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah. That’s very much inspired by Iranian example and advice.”

Description: From Israel’s military response to whether China will mediate

Content: Welcome to The Daily 202! Tell your friends to sign up here. In Israel, more than 1,000 people have been killed since Saturday's attacks, according to the Associated Press. Palestinian authorities say that in Gaza, at least 830 people have been killed. Four things to watch in the Israel-Hamas warThe eyes of the world are once again on the Middle East after Hamas — which America and the European Union formally brand a terrorist group — carried out a sophisticated, large-scale surprise attack on Israel that has left hundreds dead and is drawing comparisons to 9/11 in terms of national trauma.

It’s too soon to say whether the bloody events of this weekend and the Israeli retaliation will dramatically reshape the region. But it certainly has the potential to be a once-in-a-generation crisis that fundamentally alters the dynamics of the decades-old conflict between the Palestinians and Israel and changes that close U. S. ally’s relationship with its neighbors.

Israeli warplanes have pounded Gaza, while Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the enclave would be cut off from vital services, vowing there would be “no electricity, no food, no fuel” for its estimated 2.3 million residents. (Some supplies may still get in through the Rafah crossing Gaza shares with Egypt.)

“We are deeply concerned about Hezbollah making the wrong decision and choosing to open a second front to this conflict,” the official said. “Iran backed adversaries like Lebanese Hezbollah should not question the commitment of the U. S. government to support the defense of Israel.”

President Biden has spoken several times to Netanyahu in recent days, and promised American help in the form of replenishing Israel’s “Iron Dome” anti-rocket defenses and intelligence cooperation. Biden has also sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean. Biden is scheduled make remarks on the crisis at 1 p.m. today.

But when it comes to aid that Congress must approve, things are less clear. The House of Representatives currently lacks an elected Speaker, raising questions about what the chamber can actually pass.

Even as the United States has taken steps to extricate itself from the Middle East, Beijing has taken a more assertive diplomatic role in a region from which it gets the bulk of its oil.

But the invocation of 9/11 should give everyone pause. Twenty-two years after those attacks, key al-Qaeda plotters are dead or in prison, but Afghanistan is back in the hands of the Taliban. Iraq, invaded despite not having a role in the attacks, is a fragmented country under greater Iranian influence than before the war.

“Israel’s military announced that the country’s border is under control after hours of fighting and airstrikes Tuesday. Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss of the 98th Division said that the military is now ‘moving into the offensive … to change the reality within Gaza to prevent such a thing from happening again,’” our colleagues report.

“Momtaj Mansur is one of more than 50 current and former workers who said they were misled and exploited by firms that supply labor to Amazon in Saudi Arabia and by their network of recruiting agencies in Nepal,” NBC News, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and the Guardian report.

“The White House is considering a move to attach Ukraine funding to a request for urgent aid to Israel, according to several people familiar with the deliberations, in the hopes that such a pairing would increase the chance that Congress would approve aid to Kyiv despite growing opposition from House Republicans,” Yasmeen Abutaleb, John Hudson, Jeff Stein and Leigh Ann Caldwell report.

“On Saturday, the moon will pass in front of the sun, obscuring much of it but leaving behind a brilliant ring, or annulus, of unfiltered sunlight in parts of the western United States. This is known as an ‘annular’ or ‘ring of fire’ solar eclipse,” Matthew Cappucci reports.

Headline: Inside an Israeli town destroyed by Hamas

Description: The Israeli army escorted a group of journalists inside the town of Kfar Azza on Tuesday as bodies were recovered. “It is a big massacre,” a general said. “A catastrophe.”

Content: Military officials said the village was finally secured late Monday after 2½ days of intense fighting. But with regular explosions overhead and black plumes of smoke rising above the Gaza Strip just over a mile away, the battle felt far from over.

The Israeli army escorted a group of journalists inside the town early Tuesday as the recovery of bodies was beginning. The pastoral community of about 400 is one of the closest to Israel’s sophisticated border fence with Gaza, which Hamas militants breached with apparent ease Saturday before rampaging through town after town. The burned homes and crushed cars here were surrounded by unmarked fields and groves. Water poured down the slope from a busted main.

Kfar Azza was still off limits to the residents who had time to flee. So many didn’t survive the shocking invasion, which shattered the peace of a weekend morning so suddenly that full cups of coffee and a jug of milk still sat on the table in one kitchen. The floor was smeared with blood.

Outside, the air was heavy with the smell of smoke and death. Many of these low, boxy houses contained more bodies, said Maj. Gen. Itai Veruv — those of slain residents and perhaps more of their attackers. He couldn’t say how many.

Veruv was the commander of the huge defensive operation that the Israel Defense Forces scrambled to mount after being caught badly off guard on the last day of the Jewish Sukkot holiday. He was officially retired until he heard the news, just after dawn, that villages in the south had been overrun.

By 9 a.m., he was in the area, where he stayed for three days, bearing witness to the worst scenes he has seen in 40 years of service. “I never saw anything like this,” he said. “I never imagined.”

The soldiers have tried to understand how the attack unfolded by looking at the bullet scars on the wall, and the pattern of a dozen dead infiltrators whose bodies still lay on lawns and sidewalks — among some 1,500 bodies of Palestinian militants the military says it has found across Israel. There was a crashed paraglider near a bus stop where one of the gunmen had descended from the sky. One of their motorcycles lay on its side near a pickup truck with shattered windows, its emergency lights still flashing.

The town’s small security squad — residents with guns — gathered toward the western edge of the compound when the attackers came, Veruv said. He pointed out a block of houses they called “the baby section,” because of all the young families who lived here. Those who were armed clearly fought, the soldiers said, but many didn’t survive.

Most of the vehicles in a sandy parking area were heavily damaged, with bullet holes and broken windshields and doors twisted out of shape. The infiltrators apparently went down the line, looking for cars to steal. “They wanted a way to take hostages,” one soldier said.

One team loaded white body bags into the back of the truck. Another worked with six black bags, some with the Star of David, gathering them in the shade of a tree. At the entrance to the kibbutz, a crowd of Orthodox volunteers wearing yarmulkes, rubber gloves and safety vests waited  to make sure all remains had been collected, a requirement for Jewish burial.

Some civilians still lay where they fell. Behind one house, a woman with bare feet and red pants had been covered with a cloth; a man in shorts was in the stream of water from the damaged main.

A column of troop carriers rolled into the compound, and then another one. A tank rumbled past the farm equipment that sat idly at the edge of a field. Israel was reinforcing its hold on a community that, for days, it had lost.

The IDF said Tuesday that it was increasingly confident that the area was secure, and that its forces were preparing to go on the offensive against Hamas.

Description: While the U.S. and E.U. condemned the attacks, Iran congratulated Hamas, and Qatar blamed Israelis for the escalating violence.

Content: Return to menu

The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both of which normalized relations with Israel through the Abraham Accords, have condemned the attacks.

The UAE, which in 2020 became the first Persian Gulf country to normalize relations with Israel in about three decades, said Sunday that Hamas’s attacks were a “serious and grave escalation” and called for de-escalation and civilian protections on both sides.

“The UAE reaffirmed that the international community must remain resolute in the face of these violent attempts to derail ongoing regional efforts aimed at dialogue, cooperation, and coexistence,” the statement said, “and must not allow nihilistic destruction to overtake a region whose people have already suffered enough war and trauma.”

Bahrain’s initial statement Saturday made no mention of Hamas and warned that “the continuation of violence will impede the efforts aiming at achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.” But on Monday, the Foreign Ministry joined the UAE in calling Hamas’s attacks an “escalation” and denounced the “reported kidnappings.”

Morocco, which has also agreed to normalize relations with Israel, was more muted in its response. It expressed “deep concern” while condemning attacks on civilians “wherever they may be.” But one of Morocco’s largest parties in Parliament called Hamas’s actions “heroic” and a “legitimate reaction to daily violations.”

Sudan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement published by the official Sudan News Agency that the violence stemmed from a decline in international interest in the Palestinian issue. Sudan signed the Abraham Accords in 2021.

“Sudan renews its support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to have their independent state,” the statement read.

Saudi Arabia, which has been in talks for months with Israel about a potential normalization agreement but is not part of the Abraham Accords, called for an immediate end to the violence. It did not explicitly denounce Hamas.

“The Kingdom recalls its repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities,” the statement read.

Headline: Among Americans killed or missing in Israel

Description: At least 14 Americans were killed in Saturday’s unprecedented attacks in Israel, while others are missing or held hostage.

Content: On Tuesday, President Biden confirmed that Americans were also among the hostages taken by Hamas, but he did not specify how many. “As president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world,” Biden said. “Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond and indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks.”

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said there are 20 American citizens unaccounted for, at least some of whom are Hamas hostages. That puts the U. S. government in uncharted territory as it seeks the safe return of large numbers of its citizens from Gaza. Biden said Monday that he had directed his team members to work with their Israeli counterparts on “every aspect of the hostage crisis.”

Americans killed or missing in the attacks include tourists visiting Israel; U. S. citizens serving in the Israeli army; people born in the United States who immigrated to Israel; and children born in Israel to American parents who then acquired U.S. citizenship, like Katsman. They range in age from 18 to 80. It is unclear whether any American citizens have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza.

Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter Natalie, 18, live in Evanston, Ill., and were visiting relatives at a kibbutz near Gaza. Natalie had just graduated from Deerfield High School, where she was known as a talented artist. On Saturday, Natalie’s father, Uri, received a message from his daughter that said they were under attack. Then nothing, relatives said, weeping as they spoke with a reporter.

Americans were also among the revelers at an open-air trance music festival that turned into a scene of carnage. Danielle Ben-Senyor, 34, was born in Los Angeles and moved to Israel so her ailing parents could be closer to family members, said her cousin Riki Ben-Senyor. Early Saturday, Danielle, who had worked as an intensive-care nurse during the pandemic, left Tel Aviv with a group of friends to attend the music festival.

Goldberg-Polin was born in California and his parents grew up in Chicago. They learned from eyewitnesses that he fled the festival in a car and sought safety in a public bomb shelter. About 30 people were in the small cement structure when they were attacked by militants, who threw grenades and fired weapons. Then they told anyone who could stand to walk outside.

A witness saw Goldberg-Polin walk out, his mother said. He was missing his arm from his elbow down and had improvised a tourniquet. He was loaded onto a pickup truck with three other young men and two women. Israeli police traced the last signal from his cellphone to the border with Gaza.

Goldberg addressed a news conference Tuesday along with relatives of three other missing Americans, where they urged the U. S. government to do everything in its power to find their loved ones. Jonathan Dekel-Chen’s son Sagui, 35, disappeared after an attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the family lived. Dekel-Chen said he knew of at least three other American citizens from their kibbutz who were missing and two other Americans who were killed.

Katsman won a prize for an academic paper he wrote about contemporary religious Zionism, the focus of his research. “I really think his work helped illuminate some of the very dynamics that have brought us to this horrific moment,” said Liora Halperin, a historian at the University of Washington. “There are many pieces to this puzzle, but he had devoted years of his life trying to understand some of the pieces.”

Katsman had a “very deep concern for all the residents of Israel and the Palestinian territories,” said Devin Naar, another historian at the university who asked Katsman to be his teaching and research assistant. Katsman didn’t despair but retained a kind of hope and optimism that a different future was possible, Naar said. He then stopped speaking, overcome by emotion.

Wacholder Katsman has not yet been able to arrange her son’s funeral amid the chaos of so many deaths. But she knows one thing. He “wouldn’t want this conflict to be used to kill innocent people,” she said. “He would want this conflict to end as soon as possible.”

Description: The violence in Israel and Gaza has reignited tensions on U.S. college campuses over a conflict that for decades has fueled student and faculty activism.

Content: The violence in Israel and Gaza has reignited tensions on U. S. college campuses over a conflict that for decades has fueled student and faculty activism, and divided academic communities. The reaction at Vanderbilt is just one example of the tightrope some college leaders appear to be attempting: renouncing the violence and pleading for security and civility on their campuses, while often sidestepping the contentious politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

At Vanderbilt, it was unclear why the university took down the chancellor’s earlier statement about the war. When The Washington Post asked if it had been pulled because of criticism, Vanderbilt spokesperson Julia Jordan said that the “statement from the chancellor,” as it was labeled online, was actually not a “statement.”

Higher education has long provided a staging ground for contentious debates related to Israel, whether it’s students pushing for universities to divest from the nation or protesters clashing with campus speakers on either side of the political divide. But the immediacy of the current conflict has created what some students described as a profound unease on campuses, however far they may be geographically from the front lines of the war.

Chanie Goldman, co-director of the Chabad Jewish Student & Community Center at UF, said that a loud sound during the vigil — apparently a steel water bottle hitting the ground — was misinterpreted by some as a gunshot. Students had arrived at the event fearing something might happen, she said, and it didn’t take much to cause alarm. “Jewish kids are very scared and very on edge,” Goldman said. “It’s a rough time now.”

Some students said this week they hoped to set politics aside and focus on the profound loss of life. Jacob Bigelman, a junior at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said he was so distraught by the events in Israel, where he had studied during a gap year after high school, that he couldn’t focus in the library on Sunday morning. Instead, he channeled his energy into organizing a vigil. “Let’s just do something,” Bigelman recalls telling a friend.

“There’s obviously going to be time to engage in talks about all that is going on and all that’s unfolding,” Bigelman said in an interview Monday. “But our message [at the vigil] was about unity and being just one strong Jewish community. I told one of our rabbis, I was so blind to how large and how strong the Jewish student body on campus is.”

Johaer Jilani, a student director of the Muslim Students Association National, said he worried that any “geopolitical event” of this kind might trigger anti-Muslim sentiment. Jilani, a medical student at Howard University, said he condemns violence against civilians, whether perpetrated by Palestinians or Israelis. He expressed disappointment, however, that university leaders have not generally given voice to the Palestinian cause. This is particularly regrettable, Jilani said, given how Muslim students have rallied in support of other social justice and liberation causes, such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the Ukrainian resistance, which are widely embraced in higher education.

Diverging views on the conflict are already creating divisions on campuses. Over the weekend, Students for Justice in Palestine at Rutgers University issued a statement standing with the “Palestinian resistance” and calling the attack on Israel a “justified retaliation.” The message was deeply offensive to Jewish students, said Lisa Harris Glass, chief executive of Rutgers Hillel, one of the nation’s largest chapters. In addition, she said stickers with QR codes leading to an Arabic language website were placed on bollards outside the organization’s building, which Glass interpreted as hostile. Hillel requested and received additional security in response, she said.

Description: The Gaza Strip, a 140-square-mile stretch of land with more than 2 million people, depends on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services.

Content: Defense officials have ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza after militants broke through its border wall into southern Israel on Saturday and killed at least 1,200 people, many of them civilians — the deadliest day in Israeli history. In Israel and Gaza, people brace for a long and costly war“No power, no food, no gas,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. “We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.” Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, orchestrated the ambush over the weekend, when militants took more than 100 hostages to Gaza.

Israel has bombarded the densely populated enclave in retaliation, killing at least 1,100 people. On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that the border with Gaza was secured and that it was preparing for an offensive.

The Gaza Strip, a 140-square-mile stretch of land with more than 2 million people, depends on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Cutting off gas and power from the territory could leave many residents not only without power, but without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care. On Wednesday, Palestinian authorities said Gaza’s only power plant has run out of fuel and stopped operating.

United Nations Secretary General António Guterres condemned the siege Monday. “The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,” he said in a statement.

Israel provides Gaza with power in two ways. Gaza’s sole power plant is operated by diesel fuel, which enters Gaza from the Karem Shalom crossing. There are also 10 direct power lines from Israel to Gaza.

The Israeli siege could also “result in a severe shortage of already scarce drinkable water,” the United Nations said. The territory has several major desalination plants, which transform water from the Mediterranean Sea into drinkable water, but they need power to operate.

Sanitation facilities, too, could be crippled by the outages, increasing concerns about disease. Past fuel shortages in Gaza have caused sewage from the strip to contaminate agricultural land and spill into Israel.

Gaza “was on the edge of a humanitarian crisis for a very long time,” said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East regional director of Mercy Corps. “So this additional shock is going to turn this into a full-blown crisis very quickly.”

Israel withdrew its civilian population and military forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but has continued to control the flow of goods and people. When Hamas assumed political power of the territory in 2007, Israel imposed an air and sea blockade, which is also enforced by Egypt to the south.

Over the course of the 16-year blockade, Israel has imposed shutdowns during key moments in the conflict, including Operation Cast Lead, which began in December 2008, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014. Those military campaigns killed more than 3,500 Palestinians in total.

“Israel used its control over the access to goods and infrastructure needs as a way of creating a carrot-and-stick approach to the governing body in Gaza, Hamas,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “If things are calm, things are opened up. If things get tense, Israel shuts the spigot.”

The siege could also affect hospitals, which can run on generators but need fuel to power them. Several health-care facilities were already hit by Israeli strikes.

“We are very concerned to see that medical facilities have not been spared,” Léo Cans, Doctors Without Borders’ head of mission in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement. “[An] airstrike destroyed an ambulance carrying the wounded, right in front of the hospital where we work.”

Israel has justified its overwhelming use of force by saying it must destroy Hamas’s military capabilities to prevent any future assaults on the country.

Headline: Graphic war videos go viral, testing social media’s rules

Description: As some major platforms ban Hamas, others take a laissez-faire approach.

Content: On Google’s YouTube and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, you can stand with Israel, call for peace or lament the plight of Palestinians. But expressions of support for Hamas are forbidden. Both companies consider Hamas an extremist organization, meaning that no one affiliated with the group is allowed to use their platforms, and no videos or images created by Hamas can be posted there.

In contrast, the influential messaging platform Telegram does very little content moderation. It hosts a Hamas channel that has been openly broadcasting grisly footage and images of dead Israelis to more than 100,000 subscribers. And some of those posts have been rebroadcast on Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, which nominally prohibits Hamas content but appears to be doing relatively little to police it after Musk laid off the majority of the company’s employees.

Experts say X in particular has become a hub for posts and videos taken down by other platforms for violating their rules against graphic violence or hate speech. On Tuesday, European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton posted a letter to Musk warning him that regulators have “indications” that the site may be in violation of European rules on violent and terrorist content, as well as disinformation.

In the case of the Israel-Gaza war, those calls are complicated by a desire to avoid being seen as abetting a terrorist organization by enabling it to broadcast propaganda, threats, hostage videos or even executions. Facebook has been sued in the past by the families of people killed by Hamas. And earlier this year, Google, Twitter and Meta defended themselves at the Supreme Court against charges that they had materially aided the Islamic State terrorist group  by hosting or recommending its content, such as recruiting videos. (In each of those cases, the tech firms prevailed.)

But defining what counts as an extremist group isn’t always straightforward, and social media platforms over the years have faced scrutiny over which government actors, political movements, military operations and violent regimes get a voice and which don’t. After the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan in 2021, social media companies had to make a high-stakes decision about whether to continue to ban the Taliban, since it had taken over the country’s government.

“Within social media companies, the category that you’re placed in determines how your speech is going to be treated,” said Anika Collier Navaroli, senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and a former senior Twitter policy official. “The speech of a political party is going to be treated extremely different than the speech that comes from a terrorist. The speech from a legitimate nation-state is also going to be treated different than somebody who is not recognized as that.”

On TikTok, both the #Israel and #Palestine hashtags have attracted tens of billions of views as young people turn to the platform for news and perspectives on the conflict. But at least one prominent account that covers news from a Palestinian perspective received a notice Monday that it had been permanently banned. TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said Tuesday that the ban was a mistake and that the account, Mondoweiss, was reinstated.

Since Hamas’s incursion began, TikTok has shifted more content moderators to focus on posts about the conflict, including posts in Arabic and Hebrew, Favazza said. It has also been blocking some hashtags associated with graphic violence or terrorist propaganda, including footage of hostages or executions. And it is working with fact-checkers to identify misinformation, though a quick browse through popular searches such as “Israel” and “Gaza” on Tuesday turned up numerous videos from previous, unrelated conflicts that were being presented as though they were new. Other videos racked up views with graphic footage of Israeli victims, likely produced originally by Hamas, with a thin veneer of commentary decrying the acts.

Meta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement that the company had established “a special operations center” with experts who are fluent in Hebrew and Arabic to closely monitor the situation. “Our teams are working around the clock to keep our platforms safe, take action on content that violates our policies or local law, and coordinate with third-party fact checkers in the region to limit the spread of misinformation,” Stone said.

On Telegram, an apparently official Hamas account with close to 120,000 subscribers has routinely posted grisly video of the attacks on Israel. One clip, with more than 77,000 views, showed an unidentified militant stomping on a dead soldier’s face. Many of the videos have been reposted to X. At least one of the videos was also posted by the media outlet Al Jazeera Arabic to YouTube, where it has nearly 13 million subscribers, but with some of the gore blurred.

ARTICLE NUMBER 24

Headline: With Gaza and Israel at war, Palestinian Authority struggles to be heard
Publish Date: Wednesday, October 11, 2023 at 05:47 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/11/israel-gaza-war-abbas-pa/ 
Description: As Gaza prepares for what is expected to be an extensive Israeli ground invasion, the public absence of Palestinian political leadership is adding to the chaos.

Content: Abbas is backed by the West but is widely unpopular across the Palestinian territories, where people are seething at the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and a year of deadly raids across the West Bank. His autocratic government is viewed by many Palestinians as an extension of the Israeli occupation.

The Palestinian Authority’s “silence reflects a very clear weakness,” said Rula Shadeed, co-director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy. “And also that their hands are tied. The way that they have been handling the struggle for liberation has not been fruitful in any way.”

At 87 years old, Abbas is in the 18th year of a four-year term as head of the Palestinian Authority, established as an interim government by the 1993 Oslo accords. The agreements gave the authority partial sovereignty over parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which along with East Jerusalem were meant to be part of a future Palestinian state. Yet the Oslo maps no longer reflect the realities on the ground; the hope of a two-state solution has grown more remote with each passing year.

In 2007, following a disputed election in Gaza, Hamas violently ousted the Authority from the strip. Israel imposed a land and sea blockade on the tiny coastal enclave and fought four wars in Gaza in the intervening years. The fifth, which many fear will be the most deadly, was declared Sunday.

The fighting began Saturday when, under the cover of thousands of rockets fired from Gaza, hundreds of Hamas gunmen broke through Israel’s high-tech border wall and terrorized towns across the south. They killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 100 hostages back to the strip.

Israel has responded with an unrelenting campaign of airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 1,000 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Gazans on Saturday to “leave now,” but most have nowhere to go. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege” of the enclave, cutting off access to power and basic supplies.

At least 179 Palestinians have been killed across the territory since January, according to the United Nations, making 2023 the deadliest year for West Bank Palestinians in two decades. There has also been a surge in violent attacks by Israeli settlers, urged on by far-right members of Netanyahu’s government.

Israeli and Palestinian Authority security forces have struggled to contain the rise of new militant groups in Palestinian refugee camps. Some have ties to more established armed groups, including Hamas, but most are loosely organized. The majority of the fighters are young and poor. They are fed up with the occupation and disillusioned with their leaders in Ramallah.

Abbas now finds himself caught in the middle, as he has been for much of his political career — criticized by Israel and the United States for not condemning militant violence, and by Palestinians for his close ties with Washington and the Authority’s security cooperation with Israel.

Events in Gaza are “increasing the political weight of Hamas and decreasing the political weight and influence of the PA,” said Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister of planning. “Because now is the time for fighting. And the popular parties are the parties involved in the fighting.”

Mkheimer Abusada, one of Gaza’s most respected political analysts, did not have politics on his mind when reached by phone from Gaza City. “Why are you asking about the PA?” he said. “Why aren’t you asking about setting up a humanitarian corridor? There are 2 million people who are trapped by Israel without a safe passage.”

Headline: Gambling on a ‘pragmatic’ Hamas was a deadly mistake, analysts say
Publish Date: Wednesday, October 11, 2023 at 11:55 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/11/hamas-strategy-israel-containment/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_19 
Description: In recent years, Hamas made moves that led some observers to believe the threat to Israel was contained. They were wrong.

Content: Longtime observers of Hamas debate how much the Palestinian militant group truly evolved over the last decade, particularly during the period sometimes known as its “pragmatic era.” There is no argument, however, about when that era ended: Just after sunrise Saturday with the launch of a devastating attack on Israel. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.Since it seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, Hamas, while steadfast in its rejection of Israel’s right to exist as a state, nevertheless had made small overtures, analysts say, such as signaling support for a long-term cease-fire and opening diplomatic back channels. As the years ticked by, some Middle East analysts even began speaking of Hamas as “contained,” though they reserved skepticism for the militants they knew as among the most strategic and protean in the region.

Then came the eventual — many would say inevitable — break from that position last weekend with a Hamas operation that stunned the world in its brazenness and brutality. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 100 were captured as hostages. The atrocities inflicted upon civilians, including children, analysts said, signals a dark new chapter for a group that likes to boast of striking Israeli military and police targets, distinguishing its conduct from the bloodlust of Islamic State extremists.

That’s the question researchers and policymakers who for years have monitored Hamas are trying to answer as they revisit the group’s trajectory to understand the motivations for an attack so extraordinary in its scope and lethality that Hamas surely realized it was risking its own annihilation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “cleanse” the area of Hamas in a war of vengeance whose toll on the militants “will reverberate with them for generations.”

Hamas’s official line is that the attack was in response to Israel’s long-running blockade and violence against Palestinians, but researchers said a host of other factors shaped the timing and methods. They also cautioned that the conflict remains fluid, with little verified information about the genesis of the operation and whether Hamas had help from Iran or other regional backers to execute it.

Another factor is the internal Israeli political crisis. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition government has continued apace with settlement construction while pushing controversial judicial overhauls that would hobble the courts’ role as a check on executive power. With thousands of Israelis protesting in the streets, analysts said Hamas may have seen the Israeli state in a vulnerable position and Palestinian voices once again sidelined in a political fight that could shape their future.

Amid the chaos, a group of Islamist militants saw an opening. They issued leaflets offering themselves as an alternative to both oppression by Israel and corruption from mainstream Palestinian leaders. Founders of the group, a Muslim Brotherhood spinoff that came to be known as Hamas, “viewed the intifada as an opportune time to leverage all the preparation that had been taking place clandestinely for years” to create an Islamist resistance movement, Baconi wrote in his book.

Like other Islamist groups, Hamas initially gained popularity among Palestinians by creating local charities and programs to tackle health care and education. That translated into political power in 2006 when the Hamas bloc known as “Change and Reform” won legislative elections, posing an existential threat to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority. As in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere, the White House had pushed for elections, then balked when voters picked militant Islamists over secular leaders who were seen as ineffectual and beholden to Western interests.

Ligon said Hamas stood out among regional militants because its leaders put a premium on enlisting recruits with military skill and technological expertise, “not just guys that were willing to fight and die for the cause.” She said Hamas fighters looked back at the history of World War I tunnellers as they dug their own underground warrens to circumvent the blockade. They also looked forward, she said, encouraging innovation.

Description: A scholar. A former nurse. A Missouri native who died shielding her teenage son. They’re among the Americans killed in Saturday’s terrorist attacks in Israel.

Content: Return to menu

When Hayim Katsman received his doctorate from the University of Washington in 2021, friends encouraged him to stay in the United States. He could build a good life there, they said, maybe even in Seattle, a city where his family had long roots.

Katsman, 32, was adamant. He wanted to return to Israel and the small commune where he had lived for years. He was committed to forging a more peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians. His dissertation was dedicated to “all life forms that exist between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.”

Katsman was hiding in a closet with a neighbor, Avital Alajem, when militants overran the kibbutz. He was closest to the door, Alajem told CNN, and his body absorbed the bullets, protecting Alajem. “He was murdered,” Alajem said. “I was saved.”

Katsman was a rare combination, friends said. He was a gifted scholar but also a car mechanic, landscaper and DJ. He worked hard yet always had time for his friends, whether to help them move or catch up over a beer.

His mother, Hannah Wacholder Katsman, grew up in Cincinnati, while his father, Daniel Katsman, is from Seattle. The family moved to Israel in 1990, and Hayim, the second of six siblings, was born a year later.

A dual U. S.-Israeli citizen, Katsman won a prize for an academic paper he wrote about contemporary religious Zionism. “I really think his work helped illuminate some of the very dynamics that have brought us to this horrific moment,” said Liora Halperin, a historian at the University of Washington. “There are many pieces to this puzzle, but he had devoted years of his life trying to understand some of the pieces.”

In the first days after the attacks, his mother was unable to arrange her son’s funeral amid the chaos of so many deaths. But she knew one thing. He “wouldn’t want this conflict to be used to kill innocent people,” she said. “He would want this conflict to end as soon as possible.”

Headline: Trump faults Netanyahu, calls Hezbollah ‘very smart’ amid Israel war
Publish Date: Thursday, October 12, 2023 at 04:12 AM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/12/trump-israel-netanyahu-comments/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8 
Description: GOP rival Ron DeSantis criticized the remark as “absurd.”

Content: “[I]t is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as ‘very smart,’” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Trump spokesman Steven Cheung defended the former president’s comments as meant to criticize unspecified U. S. officials for giving Hezbollah the idea to attack from the north. He said Trump was referring to a briefing by a senior U.S. defense official on Monday that expressed concern about Hezbollah opening a second front. In fact, Hezbollah started bombardments a day earlier, according to the Associated Press.

“President Trump was clearly pointing out how incompetent Biden and his administration were by telegraphing to the terrorists an area that is susceptible to an attack,” Cheung said. “Smart does not equal good.”

“It’s completely lost on us why any American would ever praise an Iran-backed terrorist organization as ‘smart.’ Or have any objection to the United States warning terrorists not to attack Israel,” deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates said. “This is a time for all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel against ‘unadulterated evil.’”

“It is reckless and irresponsible for Trump to have made negative comments about Israel — this is a time for unified support, not irrelevant comments that could give succor to Israel’s enemies,” Klein said. “I’m so ashamed of what he said. How does he expect support from people who care about Israel after making statements like this?”

His remarks also drew a rebuke Thursday from the Israeli government’s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi. “Shameful that a man like that, a former U. S. president, abets propaganda and disseminates things that wound the spirit of Israel’s fighters and its citizens,” Karhi told the country’s Channel 13. “We don’t have to bother with him and the nonsense he spouts.”

In a New Hampshire town hall hosted by Gannett on Thursday, former U. N. ambassador Nikki Haley called Trump’s comments “dangerous,” saying that this is what she refers to when she says her party needs to chart a new path forward.

Even as Trump made his remark about Hezbollah, he acknowledged that it could be controversial, immediately adding, “The press doesn’t like when they say it.” He went on to repeat that he views Xi as a “very smart man” because “1.4 billion people, he controls it with an iron fist.”

In a speech Wednesday delivered to an auditorium of supporters in West Palm Beach, Fla., Trump elaborated that he had “a bad experience with Israel as president,” telling a story about the U. S. operation to assassinate Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. In Trump’s account, Israeli intelligence helped the United States locate Soleimani and plan the drone strike that killed him, but on the eve of the operation withdrew its participation.

The accuracy of Trump’s account could not immediately be confirmed. At the time of the assassination, the Israeli government reacted with restraint to avoid fanning tensions with Iran. In 2021, a retired Israeli military officer acknowledged that his country’s intelligence contributed to the U. S. airstrike.

“I’ll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing,” Trump said in Wednesday’s speech. “So we were disappointed by that. Very disappointed. But we did the job ourself. It was absolute precision, magnificent, beautiful job. And then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That didn’t make me feel too good. But that’s all right.”

As Trump told the story, he suggested that he was recounting it publicly for the first time and that it possibly included classified information. He was indicted earlier this year by special counsel Jack Smith on 40 counts arising from allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.

Headline: Some of the most devastating strikes Israel has carried out in Gaza

Description: Israel’s military says it has carried out more 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. The Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes.

Content: After the deadliest attack in Israel’s 75-year history, which claimed more than 1,200 lives, Israeli officials have vowed to cripple Hamas — the Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the assault. Israel’s military says it has carried out more than 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. More than 1,100 people have been killed, according to Palestinian officials.

The Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes. Many were concentrated in heavily populated areas in the north.

Israel has pledged to focus its fire on Hamas fighters and abide by international law. Hamas said Wednesday that Israeli strikes targeted the head of its military wing, killing his brother. Two members of the group’s political office were killed Tuesday.

But mosques, hospitals, residential buildings and international aid groups have also been hit. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that 13 health-care facilities were affected by the strikes. Nine U. N. staffers were killed in the strikes.

Gazans have lived under an Israeli blockade for 16 years. The 140-square-mile territory is among the most densely populated places on Earth. Of its 2 million people, about half are children — many have never been outside the strip.

Israel announced a complete siege of Gaza after the attacks. The country cut off power to the territory, leaving many residents in the dark. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials confirmed Gaza’s sole power plant had run out of fuel. Access to water, sanitation facilities and health care will be affected by the outages, aid groups warned.

All crossings out of the enclave have been closed, leaving residents with nowhere to go.

More than 263,000 people are displaced across the strip, according to the U. N. Many have sought shelter in overcrowded U.N. schools. More than 1,000 housing units are estimated to have been destroyed.

The strikes are the beginning of what Israel has said will be its largest-ever offensive in Gaza, where people have already lived through multiple wars since Hamas seized power. Some 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up, the most in 50 years. Troops are massed on Gaza’s border as Hamas continues to fire rockets into Israel.

Description: Israel’s military says it has carried out more 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. The Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes.

Content: After the deadliest attack in Israel’s 75-year history, which claimed more than 1,200 lives, Israeli officials have vowed to cripple Hamas — the Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the assault. Israel’s military says it has carried out more than 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. More than 1,100 people have been killed, according to Palestinian officials.

The Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes. Many were concentrated in heavily populated areas in the north.

Israel has pledged to focus its fire on Hamas fighters and abide by international law. Hamas said Wednesday that Israeli strikes targeted the head of its military wing, killing his brother. Two members of the group’s political office were killed Tuesday.

But mosques, hospitals, residential buildings and international aid groups have also been hit. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that 13 health-care facilities were affected by the strikes. Nine U. N. staffers were killed in the strikes.

Gazans have lived under an Israeli blockade for 16 years. The 140-square-mile territory is among the most densely populated places on Earth. Of its 2 million people, about half are children — many have never been outside the strip.

Israel announced a complete siege of Gaza after the attacks. The country cut off power to the territory, leaving many residents in the dark. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials confirmed Gaza’s sole power plant had run out of fuel. Access to water, sanitation facilities and health care will be affected by the outages, aid groups warned.

All crossings out of the enclave have been closed, leaving residents with nowhere to go.

Headline: Hamas vows to broadcast hostage executions. Tech firms can’t stop them.

Description: Live-streamed murders in Buffalo and Christchurch, New Zealand, remain visible on the web long after the mass killings took place.

Content: Hamas militants have vowed to broadcast their executions of Israeli hostages on the internet. Recent history shows there’s virtually nothing tech companies can do to prevent that from happening. Israeli strikes have pummeled Gaza. Now a land invasion is imminent.Live-streamed murders in Buffalo and Christchurch, New Zealand, remain visible on the web and have been viewed millions of times, long after the mass killings took place. Companies’ efforts to stop access to violent videos have been stymied by an open internet that makes it easy to watch, save and share videos at viral speed — and by the changing strategies of killers and propagandists, who can use a network of distributed online services to ensure the videos remain forever within reach.

A spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in an audio message posted to the group’s Telegram account this week that its fighters would kill hostages, one by one, every time an Israeli strike hits a home in Gaza, the dense coastal strip of more than 2 million Palestinians under Hamas control.

The executions, the spokesman said, would be broadcast in “audio and video,” though he did not specify where or when they would be shown. Hamas is believed to have abducted more than 100 people, mostly civilians, during its brutal assault on southern Israel. Some have already been killed, according to video reviewed by The Washington Post.

The threat harks back to videos nearly a decade ago from the Islamic State, which spread fear and won attention by posting videos showing the beheadings of journalists, aid workers and other civilian captives. But those videos were prerecorded and edited. Hamas’s pledge to record and air executions that have yet to take place is new and seems calibrated to incite fear over the barbarism to come.

“Hamas’s entire strategy is to inflict as much damage as possible and drive as much attention to that damage as possible, in order to incite fear for the broader public,” said Graham Brookie, a senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “This is one of the first times we’ve seen this glossy propaganda content recorded in real time.”

Many of the videos feature relatively sophisticated touches, such as opening title animations and action-movie-style soundtracks, suggesting the group has a predesigned workflow for recording, editing and publication. Some of the videos appeared in edited form online within hours after the ambush began.

“Hamas has been very well prepared for this and has created professional systems to get their message out,” said Josh Lipowsky, a senior research analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group in Washington that tracks online extremism.

Some researchers said they expect Hamas would publish any execution videos to Telegram, from which they are likely to be reposted to mainstream sites such as X, formerly known as Twitter, where they might gain millions of views.

But the group could also live-stream the executions to a social media platform or other website using a throwaway account, as mass killers have done in recent years. Those videos could then be saved and republished across a number of other video services, practically guaranteeing that the clips would never disappear from the web.

“You cannot rule out a Christchurch-style broadcast,” Brookie said, referring to the 2019 killings of 49 people inside two New Zealand mosques that were live-streamed on Facebook. “There are very few ways to stop that. It may reach only a few people in the moment, but it has the potential to go viral.”

Telegram, which did not respond to requests for comment, has largely tolerated violent content on its platform on the basis of promoting unrestrained free expression. Other lesser-known sites specialize in the sharing of extreme videos and do not respond to requests for removal.

Facebook and other mainstream social networks pay for internal content-moderation systems and staffs to look for and block violent content. After the New Zealand shootings, 14 internet services and 55 international governments backed a policy argument, known as the Christchurch Call, designed to combat the sharing of extremist content. (Telegram is not among them.)

But the pact does not proactively monitor each live stream or shared video, and violent individuals have found ways to circumvent the rules. Last year, when a racist gunman live-streamed himself killing 10 people in a Buffalo grocery store, the video was streamed to Twitch, where it was removed within two minutes of the first gunshots — enough time for at least one viewer to repost it on other sites, including Facebook, where it was viewed millions of times.

The brutality showcased in Hamas’s videos has proved especially graphic, even compared to videos from other conflict zones around the world, due partly to the group’s preplanning and technological capabilities, Brookie said. In some of the videos, militants can be seen wearing GoPro cameras, so as to record the video from a more visceral, first-person perspective.

Such footage has become a more common facet of modern combat. Ukraine has used first-person video from soldiers’ helmets and attack drones to document its war against Russian invaders. And the use of GoPro cameras on the battlefield was first popularized by Syria’s volunteer Civil Defense force, known as the White Helmets, which have used them to record their rescues of civilians since Russia dispatched troops there in 2015.

Description: Families of Doron Asher Katz and her daughters, Aviv and Raz, Omer Wenkert and Omer Shem-Tov say they are being held in Gaza as Israel wages war with Hamas.

Content: Return to menu

Omer Wenkert traveled to the Tribe of Nova music festival on Saturday morning, just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip. About 6:30 a.m., he called his family. The night of dancing and revelry was transforming into a massacre. Wenkert, according to his uncle Ricardo Grichner, who had a family dinner with him the night before, told relatives he could hear shooting but was unable to find a way out. In a text sent shortly before 8 a.m., he said he felt scared and helpless. Then he stopped picking up his phone.

His family wasn’t sure he was alive, as reports from the scene showed Hamas militants dressed in black shooting into the crowd, overrunning the site and grabbing hostages. Survivors described gunmen blocking escape routes, ambushing those who made it out.

Then, that evening, his father received a copy of a video clip shared on Telegram. The footage, which has been independently verified by The Post, showed Wenkert on the back of a white pickup truck, stripped to his underwear, with his hands tied behind his back. Around him, men dressed in military garb shoot into the air as the vehicle speeds off.

“The good news was that he was alive,” Grichner said, recalling the moment he saw the clip for the first time. “There are no nice words to say what you can see in the movie. … They are basically pointing a gun at Omer and beating him with several guns. You can see him trying to protect his head.”

A Post analysis of the footage confirmed that the video was recorded inside the Gaza Strip, about 3½ miles from the site of the festival, just across the fence that separates it from southern Israel. The angles of the shadows show that the video was recorded in the morning — suggesting that the kidnappers took him into Gaza between 8 a.m. and noon on Saturday.

Wenkert lives with his family in the central Israeli town of Gedera, where his uncle said he works nearby as a restaurant manager. “He is a very happy guy. Very hardworking, very nice, very thoughtful,” he said. The family is concerned that in captivity, he may not receive vital prescribed medication for a stomach condition.

“I hope the government will come to its senses,” Grichner added, “and somehow get Omer and all the other captives back alive.”

Headline: Filipino and Thai workers in Israel narrowly escape death

Description: Amid the horrific stories of death in southern Israel, migrant workers from Thailand and the Philippines also dodged the violence, with some still held hostage.

Content: Torres looked outside and caught a glimpse of men on a motorcycle, brandishing assault rifles. One of them shot at the window, and Torres ran into the shelter for cover. Many homes in Israel bordering the Gaza Strip are equipped with safe rooms to use as shelter from incoming rockets.

The gunmen were soon battering at the door, and as they crashed through, Torres darted from the safe room, grabbed her lola from the bathroom and pulled her into the shelter, slamming the door shut. The sounds of gunshots were everywhere.

“If I didn’t, she would be dead,” said Torres, 25. Together they waited in the reinforced shelter for 35 hours while gunshots echoed outside, a sign of the terrible slaughter being inflicted. “I wouldn’t be able to take it if I left my employer outside.”

Amid the horrific stories of Israeli communities murdered and people carried off as hostages by the Hamas attackers, the acute vulnerability of Israel’s tens of thousands of migrant workers, many from Southeast Asia, has often been overlooked.

At least two Filipinos have been confirmed killed so far in southern Israel, according to the Philippine government. They worked as caregivers and died with their employers, overseas community organizers told The Washington Post. About two-thirds of the 30,000 Filipinos in Israel perform care work.

At least 21 Thai workers have been killed so far as well, and 14 others have been taken hostage, the Thai government has reported. About 30,000 Thai citizens work in Israel, overwhelmingly in the agricultural sector.

The global agricultural industry is already one of the most hazardous, failing to meet international standards on basic rights and often exploiting the vulnerability of migrant workers, labor rights advocates say. “It’s exacerbated when it takes place in conflict zones,” said David Welsh, Thailand country director of Solidarity Center, an international labor rights organization.

The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it has called for the safe release of its citizens and reached out to Palestinian authorities to help facilitate this. Both the Philippines and Thailand have condemned the violence in broad terms.

Surachai Seehajumpa, 40, came to Israel last year to pay off debts and save up to buy property. Work at his farm around 60 miles from Gaza carries on as usual — but he and his colleagues now can hear explosions in the distance. He regularly checks the news to see how the violence is escalating and decide whether it is time to join 5,000 other Thai nationals seeking passage home.

A laborer in Israel can earn around $1,300 a month, about five times more than minimum wage in Thailand.  Surachai’s farm recently took in two other Thai workers fleeing violence. For now, he and his 10 companions have no interest in returning home.

Protections for migrant workers depend on their contracts, relationships with employers and government schemes, said Filipino social worker and volunteer Agnes Hoffman, who has lived in Israel for 26 years. The ongoing conflict highlights the urgency of a longtime proposal from community leaders for the Philippine government to support a permanent shelter for temporary workers, she added.

“There are always Filipinos who take in other Filipinos … but those aren’t their permanent homes,” said Hoffman, who also urged authorities to provide for psychological aid to shellshocked workers in their first language.

Sally Macadini, a 38-year-old Filipino caregiver, also managed to get her elderly employer into the safe room just as the attack happened. On the chat group she maintained with fellow caregivers, she found out that a colleague a few houses away had been unable save her employer, who was shot dead.

She watched the news on the television in the safe room, relaying updates to her fellow caregivers via chat. Many hours later, there was a banging on the door, but she and her employer stayed silent until she was informed on the group chat that the Israeli army had arrived.

As for whether she would leave Israel, she is still undecided. She said she felt an obligation both to the family she worked for in Israel, and her family relying on her support at home. “We’re in doubt knowing how hard life in the Philippines is,” Macadini said. “If we go home, how do we make a living?”

Description: As the worlds awaits Israel’s next response to the Hamas surprise attack, Israel is turning into a country at war.

Content: Twenty miles east, at Jerusalem’s popular Malha Mall, the parking lot is all but empty. Almost every shop is closed, here and across the country. Those who would normally work and shop are pouring into the ranks. Others are making their own preparations for a conflict that promises to be long-lasting and hard-hitting.

People working in offices and fields just five days ago are back in uniform, some 360,000 of them so far, in one of the largest mobilizations in the country’s history. Schools are closed. Local governments are straining to provide services as their workforces dwindle.

“We’re working under fire now, but we have no choice,” said Shaul Schneider, executive chairman of Ashdod Port, where crane operators 200 feet above the ground have to hope for the best when Hamas rockets scream overhead, sometimes 10 times a day. “Unfortunately, Israel has experience in such situations.”

Much of the country is eerily still. Streets normally jammed with honking traffic are quiet. Jaffa Street, a popular shopping strip in Jerusalem, was a ghost town Wednesday night, lined with flashing police cars. Construction sites are silent, and the Palestinian laborers who normally work at them have been prohibited from crossing over from the West Bank since Saturday.

Much of the shopping to be seen is families scrambling to stock up on essentials. Israel’s military Home Front Command instructed citizens on Monday to equip their bomb shelters and basements with three days of supplies. Apartment buildings instructed residents to remove bikes and personal items from safe rooms and stock them with emergency provisions.

For Palestinians living in Israel, staying out of sight is a basic preparation for war. All have memories of the fighting between Arabs and Jews inside Israel and say they can feel the fury being directed at Hamas.

Hazem, a cabdriver in Jerusalem who gave only his first name to protect his identity, has mostly stayed inside since he had his children brought home early from school Saturday. On a cabbies’ WhatsApp group, he read of a taxi driver being beaten by Jewish settlers outside the city. When he does go out, he is stopped by soldiers.

It was only hours after the Hamas attacks Saturday when Barak Zachri got the first WhatsApp message from his old combat intelligence unit. By the end of the day, dozens of members had agreed to sign up together.

On Wednesday morning, he was among those gathered on the curb outside Julis military base near Ashkelon, some in old fatigues, some in shorts and T-shirts. Another car pulled up every few minutes, setting off another set of tight hugs from parents and partners, many of them in tears. Just 12 miles away, air force planes were bombing the Gaza enclave, home to 2 million people and likely the target of an imminent ground war.

Reports have circulated all week that the military is struggling to equip the huge numbers of reservists reporting for duty. Army officials say their supplies are keeping up, but civilians have organized equipment and food drives across the country.

“We need a switchboard, so many people are calling,” Kolinsky-Dover, the mother of two soldiers, said after fielding another cash donation offer. The Venmo account she just set up has already received more than $8,000.

“One of the reasons we’re in our current situation is because Israeli society is not connected,” co-owner Yotam Doktor said. “If we don’t come to our senses and join forces, the situation will become even worse.”

Headline: Blinken invokes Jewish ancestry in address to grieving Israeli public

Description: The secretary of state expressed unreserved support for Israel on a breakneck trip across the Middle East to prevent a wider war.

Content: Blinken stood beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who offered his gratitude to Blinken and the American public for its “incredible support for Israel in our war against the barbarians of Hamas.”

The top U. S. diplomat is on a multicountry swing through the Middle East in an effort to manage the swirling crisis as Israel vows to annihilate Hamas in response to the group’s devastating assault on Israeli communities.

Gaza will not receive water or electricity until hostages are set free, Israel’s Energy Minister Israel Katz said Thursday. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, this past weekend is believed to have taken more than 100 hostages from Israel over the border. Their fate remains unclear.

On his visit, Blinken brought one of his top aides for hostage negotiations, Steven Gillen, who will remain in Israel to keep working to free the U. S. hostages, Blinken told reporters at a news conference.

At least 25 Americans have been killed following Hamas’s assault on Saturday, said Blinken, but U. S. officials have declined to say how many Americans have been taken hostage.

During his visit, Blinken met Lior Gelbaum, 24, a dual U. S.-Israeli citizen who survived the dance rave in southern Israel that was attacked by Hamas militants. In an emotional exchange, Gelbaum told Blinken it was a “miracle” she survived, and urged the United States and Israel to focus on saving the hostages.

Blinken said the Biden administration is also in conversations with the Israelis and Egyptians to provide safe passage to civilians in Gaza before a widely expected Israeli ground invasion of the enclave.

The densely populated Gaza Strip relies on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Severing gas and power from the territory could leave many residents without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care.

Egypt urged Israel to refrain from targeting the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing — the only entry into Gaza not controlled by Israel — with airstrikes so it could be reopened for deliveries of food, water and emergency services.

“You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to,” Blinken said. “We will always be there by your side.”

Blinken assured Israelis that there was bipartisan support for Israel in the U. S. Congress, which is preparing to approve more military aid to Israel amid competing demands for aid to Taiwan, Ukraine and the U.S. southern border.

“We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard, even when it’s difficult,” he said. “That’s why it’s so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.”

Netanyahu said he showed Blinken graphic images of babies allegedly mutilated and burned by Hamas. U. S. officials said they were not in a position to authenticate the images, but Blinken described what he saw in the pictures as “depravity in the worst imaginable way.”

U. S. officials are also working to provide safe passage to some of the estimated 500 to 600 Palestinian American residents of Gaza who are seeking to flee, said a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.

Blinken did not confirm or deny a Washington Post report that the United States and Qatar have quietly agreed not to allow the release in the near term of Iranian oil revenue held in Doha. “We have strict oversight of the funds and we retain the right to freeze them,” Blinken said.

Following his lighting round of meetings on Thursday, Blinken will fly to Jordan to meet King Abdullah II and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. He also plans to travel to Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia — continuing to urge countries with diplomatic relations with Hezbollah, Iran and the Palestinians in the West Bank to persuade them to stay out of the conflict.

Headline: U.S. intel deemed wider conflict between Israel, Hezbollah ‘unlikely’
Publish Date: Thursday, October 12, 2023 at 11:14 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/12/discord-leaks-hezbollah-israel-war/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4 
Description: A top secret intelligence document from February 2023 said longtime enemies Hezbollah and Israel had settled into a posture of “mutual deterrence.”

Content: According to a top-secret U. S. intelligence document, however, a massive attack by Hezbollah, the political party and militant group backed by Iran, would be unlikely. As of early this year, U.S. intelligence analysts saw a predictable if still violent balance between Israel and Hezbollah diminishing the risk of a full-scale war in 2023.

According to an analysis prepared in February by the intelligence directorate for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Israel and Hezbollah had settled into a posture of “mutual deterrence” since the conclusion of a historic agreement, in October 2022, in which Lebanon and Israel agreed to demarcate their contested maritime borders. The deal, 11 years in the making, signified a breakthrough and allowed each country to finally explore the lucrative gas fields off their coasts.

Israel and Hezbollah had taken steps to “maintain readiness” to use force, but had remained “within their historical patterns of engagement,” which meant avoiding casualties and responding to provocations in a proportional way, according to the U. S. briefing document, which The Washington Post obtained exclusively after it was shared on the chat platform Discord.

Hezbollah is Lebanon’s strongest armed group and political party. Along with its allies, it held the majority in parliament until elections in 2022 when it fell short a few seats. The coalition still maintained the largest number of seats in parliament.

As Lebanon falls deeper into an economic crisis, and in the absence of state institutions and benefits, Hezbollah has attempted to buttress its position as an alternative patron for much of the country’s historically marginalized Shiite community.

“Even during periods of heightened tensions,” Israel and Hezbollah had intended “to display strength while avoiding escalation,” according to the U. S. analysis. For example, the document explains, Israel might carry out sabotage operations in Lebanon or fire on empty land, while Hezbollah shoots down an Israeli drone or fires rockets into the northern part of the country. The actions are provocative, but they are designed to avoid casualties. Each side can demonstrate to the other that they’re on guard and capable of striking without igniting a wider outbreak of hostilities.

In April, 34 rockets were launched from southern Lebanon into Israel, an attack that the Israeli military said was carried out by Hamas operatives, whose leaders had met with the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, a day earlier in Lebanon. For months, the U. S. analysis noted, “Israel perceived a high risk of miscalculation due to Lebanon-based HAMAS plots.” Essentially, while Hezbollah might not be courting a war with Israel, that outcome was not entirely within its control, the U.S. intelligence suggested.

The State Department estimates that Hezbollah claims tens of thousands of members and supporters worldwide and receives hundreds of millions of dollars in annual support from Iran. Experts have described Hezbollah as the world’s most heavily armed non-state actor. According to public Israeli sources, Hezbollah has expanded its arsenal of rockets and missiles from around 15,000 in 2006 to 130,000 in 2021. Nasrallah has claimed the group commands 100,000 fighters.

“I think a lot of people made assumptions about how deterred Hamas and Hezbollah are,” said Matthew Levitt, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. While he broadly agreed with the U. S. intelligence assessment, Levitt said that Hezbollah was now more likely to take advantage of the war in the south, which has consumed much of the Israeli military’s attention.

“I do see [Hezbollah] gradually trying to change the rules of the game,” Levitt said. Both sides have exchanged artillery and rocket fire since the Hamas attack Saturday. Israel has deployed reservist troops to towns along the border with Lebanon.

Hezbollah leaders’ rhetoric has already begun to shift. In the first speech by a Hezbollah official after the Hamas attack, Hashem Safieddine declared the group is “not neutral in this battle.” Hezbollah’s fighters “had given their salute to Gaza in Shebaa Farms in their own, special way,” he said, referencing the strikes Hezbollah launched into a contested region on the border between the two countries on Sunday.

But, as the U. S. intelligence analysis warned, such provocations carry their own risks of escalation, especially if Hezbollah conducts what it intends to be limited strikes that end up killing Israeli forces or civilians.

Description: The family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U.S. official.

Content: For Abood Okal and his family, the nights are the worst — and each night is worse than the last. When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.

Okal and his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son Yousef left their home outside Boston last month for a long-planned reunion with their parents. They were supposed to fly home on Friday. Now they don’t know when they’ll be able to get back to the United States.

Okal’s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday’s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.

As Okal spoke over the phone from the home of his wife’s parents in the wee hours of Friday, there were at least eight audible explosions, with others in the distance.

Sleep is elusive. The bombs shake them awake, Okal said, and they find themselves coughing in air heavy with dust from pulverized buildings. He and his wife get up early, taking turns caring for their toddler and trying their best to pretend, for his sake, that everything will be all right.

The electricity is gone. The family is relying on a few solar panels, some batteries and power banks to recharge their phones and turn on a television for news. Their supply of milk and diapers is dwindling.

The market across the street has no bottled water left. Soon they will have to choose whether to risk going farther away in search of it, exposing themselves to more potential danger, or start drinking the water from a tank usually only used for washing or bathing.

Okal works at pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb and lives in Medway, a small town southwest of Boston. He went to college in New Jersey and did graduate studies in Utah, where he developed a taste for snowboarding.

Once, when he was hiking in Zion National Park, he and a group of friends were trapped by a flash flood. After many hours, they managed to get out, but park rangers told them they were lucky to survive. Now that sense of visceral fear is with him almost all the time.

“This is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,” he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. “I’ve never seen things on this scale,” Okal said.

Okal and Abuzayda have tried to get on a list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but they’re not sure if it’s functioning or if they would be turned back. When Okal’s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.

Okal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far — even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.

If his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws.

The market across the street has no bottled water left. Soon they will have to choose whether to risk going farther away in search of it, exposing themselves to more potential danger, or start drinking the water from a tank usually only used for washing or bathing.

Okal works at pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb and lives in Medway, a small town southwest of Boston. He went to college in New Jersey and did graduate studies in Utah, where he developed a taste for snowboarding.

Once, when he was hiking in Zion National Park, he and a group of friends were trapped by a flash flood. After many hours, they managed to get out, but park rangers told them they were lucky to survive. Now that sense of visceral fear is with him almost all the time.

“This is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,” he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. “I’ve never seen things on this scale,” Okal said.

Okal and Abuzayda have tried to get on a list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but they’re not sure if it’s functioning or if they would be turned back. When Okal’s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.

Okal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far — even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.

If his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws.

Description: The family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U.S. official.

Content: For Abood Okal and his family, the nights are the worst — and each night is worse than the last. When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.

Okal and his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son Yousef left their home outside Boston last month for a long-planned reunion with their parents. They were supposed to fly home on Friday. Now they don’t know when they’ll be able to get back to the United States.

Okal’s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday’s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.

As Okal spoke over the phone from the home of his wife’s parents in the wee hours of Friday, there were at least eight audible explosions, with others in the distance.

Sleep is elusive. The bombs shake them awake, Okal said, and they find themselves coughing in air heavy with dust from pulverized buildings. He and his wife get up early, taking turns caring for their toddler and trying their best to pretend, for his sake, that everything will be all right.

Headline: Israel orders 1 million Gazans to evacuate; U.N. says that’s impossible

Description: Hamas has told Gaza residents to ignore the Israeli call as “psychological warfare,” and the United States has talked about setting up safe zones in the tiny territory of 2 million people.

Content: No fuel has been allowed into the territory since the crisis began; many users, including the largest power plant, have run out or will soon. Nearly 1,800 people, roughly half of them women and children, have died in the bombing campaign, according to the territory’s health ministry. Another 7,300 have been wounded.

“What hypocrisy!” he said in a translation of a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. “We will not provide an ounce of water and electricity to those who do not evacuate. We will work with all our might to eliminate the Hamas-Daesh murders and restore security. Whatever was will not be.” Daesh is an Arabic-language acronym for the Islamic State.

“We are not going to tell Canadians to move until we know that that is a possibility and we have confirmation that these individuals can get across the border,” Julie Sunday, the assistant deputy minister for consular, security and emergency management at Global Affairs Canada, told reporters in Ottawa on Friday. “The last thing we want is Canadians getting stuck.”

U. S. officials said the situation was fluid. People who said they were linked to Hamas have set up checkpoints on the Gaza side leading to the crossing. In recent days, they’ve made several, often changing demands, including that no one can leave the enclave until trucks carrying aid on the Egyptian side are allowed to enter.

The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matters, said heavy equipment will be needed to repair damage from the Israeli airstrikes before trucks can pass. Their Egyptian counterparts, the officials said, have been cooperative, but are concerned that any opening would unleash a flood of Palestinian refugees seeking to escape. They’ve sought U. S. assurances that none of the people the United States has asked be allowed to leave — U.S. citizens, U.S. staff, including Palestinians, and Palestinians associated with American institutions — will stay in Egypt.

Headline: Evacuation order sets off chaotic scramble as Gazans run for their lives

Description: The unprecedented Israeli evacuation order, delivered Friday by fliers, voice messages and on social media, has set off a desperate scramble across Gaza.

Content: “You can die anywhere here,” Maha said in a phone interview, speaking on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her safety. “But if they’re telling us to leave, that means they are going to be doing bad things to people.”

The unprecedented Israeli evacuation order, delivered Friday by fliers, voice messages and on social media, has set off a desperate and chaotic scramble across this besieged territory. Israel has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza since Saturday, and they are still falling, even as hundreds of thousands of people try to move south.

“In the following days, the IDF will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City,” the Israel Defense Forces said Friday, adding that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels beneath civilian homes and in heavily populated areas. “Civilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields.”

James Elder, spokesman for UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, described agonizing conversations with staff members in northern Gaza: “The word ‘impossible’ was used so many times, in terms of, ‘It’s impossible for us to do this, they are asking the impossible.’ I was talking to people through tears. These are resilient people who have been through a lot but are absolutely out of options.”

A 33-year-old woman in Gaza City, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity for her safety, is staying with some 50 members of her family, including her elderly mother and father. She doesn’t know how they could leave, even if she could find a vehicle.

Israel sealed its land borders with Gaza after Hamas’s attack Saturday, and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt — the last remaining exit — has been closed for days after Israeli strikes in the area. When it does reopen, only a small number of Gazans are likely to be able to cross to safety.

“People have been calling me all morning asking if I can help them find a place to stay,” said Wesam Amer, a university lecturer who lives in Khan Younis and is already hosting extended family members. He doesn’t know of a single building in the area that has space for more. And the people keep coming.

Inside the hospital, doctors say they are running out of resources and fear they could soon be plunged into darkness. Israel has imposed a total siege on Gaza, cutting electricity and deliveries of fuel. Health officials say al-Shifa only has three more days’ worth of generator fuel; other Gaza hospitals could be out within a week.

Description: The Israeli government and Hamas say they are adhering to international humanitarian law.

Content: In Israel, Hamas militants have slaughtered civilians, unleashed a barrage of indiscriminate rocket fire, and taken at least 200 people —including Israelis and foreigners — hostage since it launched a surprise attack on Oct. 7. In Gaza, Israel has leveled entire neighborhoods, killed more than 2,700 people, and ordered a “full siege” of the territory, including shutting off access to water and power.

As the war between Israel and Hamas escalates in Gaza, human rights experts say that actions by both sides — including attacks on civilians, hostage-taking, and the targeting of hospitals and other vital infrastructure – probably violate international law.

“This is absolutely unprecedented… wars, all wars, even this war, have laws,” said Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.

“Last week’s attack on Israel was horrendous – devastating images and testimonies continue to come out,” he said at a news conference on Oct. 15 in Jerusalem. The attack and the taking of hostages are a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. But the answer to killing civilians cannot be to kill more civilians.”

In theory, the International Criminal Court at The Hague could bring charges if it suspects war crimes are being committed by either party. Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute that founded the court. The Palestinian territories joined the ICC in 2015, giving the court jurisdiction over crimes committed there — including in Gaza — or by Palestinian nationals in other territories.

In practice, however, international calls for justice are rarely without controversy — especially within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has roots dating to the late 19th century.

Headline: Reuters journalist killed in southern Lebanon by Israeli strike, colleagues say

Description: Issam Abdallah, 37, a Beirut-based video journalist, had covered conflicts in Syria and Ukraine and was remembered as “kind and heartwarming.”

Content: BEIRUT — A Reuters videographer was killed and six other journalists were wounded Friday in southern Lebanon when the area they were reporting from was struck by Israeli shelling, according to two colleagues who spoke to the injured journalists in the hospital, as well as an eyewitness. Charbel Francis, a cameraman for Al Araby TV, said he was filming a barrage of Israeli shelling on a hill, while standing about 50 feet from the other journalists, when the strike landed. The battle was in the distance, and there was no indication that fire from Lebanon was coming from anywhere near the journalists.

“We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed,” a Reuters statement read, adding that Abdallah was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon providing live coverage of skirmishes along the border. Two other Reuters journalists, Thaer al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh, “sustained injuries and are seeking medical care,” the news agency said.

The statement did not specify who was responsible. Reuters later reported, citing one of its journalists who was at the scene, that missiles “fired from the direction of Israel" struck the group.

A spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said Saturday that it was "very sorry” for the journalist’s death but that it was not sure who was responsible and that Israel would investigate.

Al Jazeera said the journalists had all gathered in one area for safety in Alma al-Chaab, a village in south Lebanon. In video posted earlier on Friday by AFP journalist Christina Assi, who was among the injured, several reporters could be seen wearing blue bullet-resistant vests marked with the word “Press.”

The Associated Press — which had a photographer on the scene — reported that an Israeli shell landed near the group during an exchange of fire with Hezbollah. The area had previously been a target of Israeli strikes, according to a Lebanese security source cited by AFP.

Reporters Without Borders said Abdallah was “killed by an Israeli strike while covering the situation on the southern border” in Lebanon. The press advocacy group described it as a “heinous crime against journalists” and said it was “continuing its investigations into the circumstances of this tragedy.”

Al Jazeera said in a statement that its broadcast vehicle was “completely burned,” adding it holds Israel "responsible for this brutal attack and calls on the international community to take action to ensure the safety of journalists.”

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a mission set up in 1978 to monitor the border between Lebanon and Israel, said in a statement posted on social media that a “heavy exchange of fire” erupted in the area beginning at 5:20 p.m. Live footage carried on several news channels showed what appeared to be sustained shelling into Lebanese territory that lasted for about an hour.

A live stream from the area showed the hillside as the blast hit. A woman is heard screaming “I can’t feel my legs” before the feed is cut. Lebanese television broadcasts showed a woman in a press vest writhing on the ground, with fire billowing and a car burning in the background.

Abdallah, 37, a video journalist based in Beirut, had covered conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and other major stories, including earthquakes that devastated southern Turkey this year. A wide circle of colleagues, friends and admirers posted tributes to Abdallah on social media Friday, and held a vigil for him in Beirut.

“He was genuinely one of the most kind and heartwarming people one could know. Totally selfless, a bundle of laughs and an extremely kind individual,” said Tariq Keblaoui, who said that a few weeks ago, Abdallah had helped him escape a protest that was being attacked.

Colleagues also remembered him as a “brave friend” and some journalists recounted during a funeral procession held for him on Saturday that he often told them there was “no story worth your life.”

Headline: A flood of misinformation shapes views of Israel-Gaza conflict

Description: A flood of misinformation in the Israel-Gaza war is shaping how panicked citizens and a global public view the conflict with Hamas.

Content: Posts, videos and memes falsely claim that the attack stemmed from collusion between Hamas and Israel. In the 24 hours after the Hamas attack, the hashtag “TraitorsFromWithin” became the top trend on X, formerly Twitter, in Hebrew. Some threads posited that workers who were Palestinian citizens of Israel were stationed at the border fence, while others claimed the attack was orchestrated to push a peace deal with Israel and Saudi Arabia.

One viral TikTok video featured a woman who identified herself as a former soldier on the Gaza Strip. She claimed that the border was so tightly controlled that even “a cockroach” would have been detected in advance — a description many commenters took to mean that Israel would have had to have aided Hamas in penetrating it.

Hamas and its supporters have taken advantage of Israel’s disunity: On Monday a pro-Hamas account called Gaza Now shared an image suggesting that former left-wing Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was fleeing the country. The image was undated and showed him in the baggage claim at an airport. The Gaza Now account had picked it up from a Jewish Israeli influencer who supports the far-right government of Netanyahu, and had shared the content to criticize Israel’s left. The influencer ultimately issued an apology on X.

A Palestinian digital rights organization called 7amleh says it has detected more than 19,000 cases of hate speech and violent incitement against Palestinians in the Hebrew language on X since Oct. 7, the first day of escalations. The organization’s executive director, Nadim Nashif, said he wasn’t able to flag the content to X because the organization’s former points of contact at the company had been fired by Elon Musk, who has dramatically shrunk the company’s workforce since he took ownership last year.

But over the past year, tech companies’ abilities to field these complaints has been compromised by waves of layoffs in units responsible for policing problematic content. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has laid off many members of a global operations team that monitors the platform, including Arabic speakers, according to a person familiar with the layoffs who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them. Under the leadership of Musk, X has fired the teams that acted as point people on the ground for advocates in the region. On Wednesday the European Union announced a probe into X for failures to moderate potentially illegal content and disinformation on its service.

Schatz said there is little communication from Meta-owned WhatsApp because the messaging platform is viewed as a private, encrypted service. And at X, he echoed Nashif’s account that, over the last year, “there has been no one to talk to” due to the firings. He said the company had reached out for the first time this week.

Description: For many Palestinians and Palestinian Americans, the days following the horrific assault by Hamas militants on Israel last weekend have been filled with worry.

Content: In their waking hours they watch the news or check their phones, hoping for a text message or maybe a brief call. They want some indication that family members or friends are okay. That they have food and water. That they are alive. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning.For many of the Washington region’s Palestinians and Palestinian Americans, including artists, activists, business owners and educators who have made the area their home, the days following the horrific assault by Hamas militants on Israel last weekend have been filled with worry. They knew there would be retribution for the rocket attacks and bloody incursion that included hostage-taking and claimed the lives of more than 1,300 people in Israel, including many civilians.

“I immediately realized the retaliation is going to be unimaginable, given the wars I’ve lived through,” said Ahmed Mansour, 30, a documentary filmmaker in Silver Spring, Md., who grew up in Gaza and left there in 2015. He said he speaks daily with his parents and eight siblings, who live in the central area of the Gaza Strip. Although they have avoided the worst of the bombardment by Israeli forces, other family members have not escaped. Mansour said that two of his uncles’ homes have been bombed and that one of his cousins was killed.

On Friday, Israel ordered more than 1 million residents of the narrow and densely populated Gaza Strip to move out of its northern region in anticipation of a ground offensive by the Israeli military to remove Hamas from power. The United Nations called for the evacuation order to be rescinded, saying the mass displacement “could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”

Mansour said in an interview Friday that he is worried about his family members and that he also is concerned about how the news media are covering the situation in Gaza, saying they fail to convey in their reporting why anger in Gaza continues to fester and boil over. He also criticized U. S. leaders for not pushing urgently for a peaceful solution.

“For 15 years, the Gaza Strip has been under siege and endured five wars,” he said, referring to Israel’s tight security cordon around Gaza. “For 75 years, Palestinians have been enduring one catastrophe after another. … If we’re serious about what’s really happening, I expected American officials would be more considerate about what’s happening and take it as a chance to really solve it rather than calling for an escalation.”

Hanna Alshaikh and her husband, who live in the Washington suburbs, have been in contact every few hours with his parents and family members in Gaza. On Thursday they learned that Alshaikh’s husband’s 88-year-old grandmother was injured when a neighboring home was bombed and glass in her windows shattered. Everyone they know in Gaza knows someone who has been killed or injured or whose home has been destroyed, said Alshaikh, 30, a Palestinian American who is pursuing a doctorate in history at Harvard University.

“We oscillate between feelings of grief and despair and feelings that time is of the essence and is precious,” she said. “And we do not have the luxury of experiencing our own fear and experiencing our own sadness.”

While her husband’s family does not live in the area that has been ordered evacuated, she said, “they do not feel that anywhere is safe in Gaza. They are packed and ready to leave at any moment.”

Alshaikh also worries that Palestinian Americans may become targets of hate crimes in the United States, especially if they speak out against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Asked about the Hamas raid into Israel last weekend, she said, “Nobody wants to see civilians harmed.”

Nassar grew up on a farm in Bethlehem in the West Bank where his family grows grapes, olives, almonds and figs. He said he does not have relatives in Gaza but worries about a war that could spread to include the West Bank, a patchwork of areas effectively under Israeli control and others governed by the Palestinian Authority, a longtime rival to Hamas, which is dominant in Gaza. As he has watched events unfold, he can only think, he said, that “violence is not the answer.”

Nassar said he has received text messages from several Jewish friends in the United States asking whether he is okay. On Friday, he heard from a rabbi he had befriended who texted to check on him. The opportunity for similar friendships does not exist where he grew up, he said.

Chris Habiby, who lives just outside D. C. and whose parents are Palestinian, said he has been checking on cousins who live in Gaza and have been moving from house to house to stay safe. His family has been able to reach them twice this week.

Headline: Hundreds of thousands flee south in Gaza after Israel orders evacuation
Publish Date: Saturday, October 14, 2023 at 04:13 PM

Description: Hundreds of thousands flee south in Gaza even as others refuse to obey an Israeli evacuation order.

Content: The main roads running north to south were crowded for a second day Saturday after the Israeli military announced a six-hour window for civilians to move along designated streets to parts of Gaza south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands here. In some areas traffic came to a standstill with trucks, buses, overpacked cars and people on foot all crowding on to the same narrow roads to head south.

“I am definitely afraid, very afraid, but I will not risk the lives of my wife and children on the way to the south,” he said, referring to reports that some of those fleeing were killed in an airstrike. “Let us die inside our homes,” he said. “The road is dangerous.”

Rawan Abu Hamda, 41, also from Gaza City, started out on an evacuation route but quickly returned home after hearing reports of a strike that hit civilians on the road. She said hundreds of other families have also stayed in her neighborhood, many sheltering near al-Shifa hospital, in hopes the building won’t be hit by airstrikes — although the ceiling of the nursery department collapsed on Oct. 9 after shelling nearby.

Reports emerged Friday of a strike on cars packed with fleeing civilians. The Washington Post verified a graphic video of the aftermath recorded along Salah Al-Deen Road. The video shows bodies, including several young children, strewn along the road as black smoke rises from vehicles engulfed in flames. On the north-facing side of the road, bodies are laid out amid personal belongings, including a bicycle, on flatbed trailers attached to a truck.

“We had no choice, we have kids, they sent us papers that said ‘you must move or you will be responsible for what may happen,’” she said, speaking to The Post through a messaging app because cellphone signals in the area were too weak to make calls.

The evacuation orders appear to signal that Israel plans to significantly escalate its war against Hamas ahead of, or in tandem with, an expected ground invasion. But human rights groups and aid organizations are warning that civilians must continue to be protected, regardless of the orders to move out.

The hospital is providing care to a “large number” of patients, including children in incubators, and people in the intensive care unit, the Red Crescent said in a statement. The group said tens of thousands of civilians remain in the area and hundreds of people are also sheltering at or near the hospital.

With the conflict entering its second week, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said that 2 million people in Gaza are now at risk of running out of water. “It has become a matter of life and death,” the agency said in a statement Saturday.

Description: Americans have been unable to cross into Egypt from Gaza after the Rafah crossing remained closed Saturday despite a U.S. deal to open it for several hours.

Content: Before dawn on Saturday, Abood Okal and his family received the news they had desperately been waiting for. Okal and his wife and their 1-year-old son were finally offered a possible way out of Gaza — and back to their home near Boston. An email from the U.S. State Department told them the sole border crossing with Egypt “may be open” for a five-hour window later that day, from noon to 5 p.m.

On Saturday morning, Okal and his family went to the Rafah crossing only to find it closed. There were no officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing except for a few plainclothes security guards whose job was to keep people from getting too close to the gate, Okal said.

The U. S. government had negotiated a deal to allow American citizens to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt during the five-hour window, U.S. officials said Saturday. But Palestinian and Egyptian officials failed to communicate about opening it, an official at the border said. By the end of the day, no one had been able to cross.

Wael Abu Omar, the Palestinian spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said Palestinian officials had not had any communication with their counterparts on the Egyptian side. Egyptian media outlets reported that Cairo would only allow foreigners to cross the border if aid shipments could be delivered to Gaza.

Israel, meanwhile, has said it would strike any trucks coming across the border, especially trucks carrying fuel, according to a diplomatic official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.

Officials are discussing the possibility of setting up a screening mechanism that would allow the Israelis to inspect goods in each vehicle entering Gaza, the diplomat said. Another official familiar with the talks over the aid deliveries said any agreement would require “Israel to stop bombing the enclave for a few hours.”

The confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Rafah crossing comes as hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in response to an evacuation order from Israel’s military, ahead of a possible ground invasion into the besieged enclave.

“We have informed U. S. citizens in Gaza with whom we are in contact that if they assess it to be safe, they may wish to move closer to the Rafah border crossing,” the spokesperson said, adding that “there may be very little notice if the crossing opens and it may only open for a limited time.”

U. S. officials have spent the past several days trying to evacuate all U.S. staff in Gaza, a group of about 15 Palestinians that includes three U.S. government employees who work for USAID in Gaza, along with their immediate family members, according to a diplomatic official familiar with the situation.

Each time, they’ve been stopped at checkpoints near the border inside Gaza and have been unable to leave. In some cases at these checkpoints, the diplomatic official said, people identifying themselves as Hamas have said none of them will be able to leave until aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip.

Canadian officials also told citizens on Friday that the Rafah crossing might open Saturday for a five-hour window to allow Canadians to exit. Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters Saturday that the “latest information” she had was that “violence” in the area forced authorities to cancel the operation. She did not elaborate.

On Friday, Okal and his extended family had rushed south from  Jabalya in the north of Gaza after the Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate. They scrambled frantically to find cars to fit them all and a place to stay near the crossing.

Okal, 36, and his family spent hours waiting under the hot sun Saturday. He said there were several hundred people there, including another American family from New Jersey. He said there were other foreign nationals too, including Canadians, Swedes, Spaniards and Norwegians.

As the day dragged on, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, took their exhausted toddler, Yousef, back to the home where they are staying with 30 other people, a short drive away. Food vendors near the crossing warned Okal that it was not safe to stay once the sun set. Still, he remained there until nearly 6 p.m., he said, hoping something might change. When he began to hear the sound of fighter planes and drones, he knew he had to leave the area.

Headline: Israel vows to ‘destroy’ Hamas. What happens to Gaza at the war’s end?
Publish Date: Sunday, October 15, 2023 at 02:57 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/15/israel-gaza-war-end/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template 
Description: The possibilities include Israel temporarily reoccupying Gaza, the return of the Palestinian Authority to the enclave and a disarmed Hamas still in power.

Content: The shape of the next Israel-Gaza relationship may depend, among other factors, on what’s left of Hamas, and Gaza, when the fighting stops. Already, Israel’s air attacks have killed more than 2,600, according to Palestinian authorities, and begun to decimate public infrastructure.

As the shock wave from a Hamas rampage that killed 1,400 Israelis has swept away old assumptions, scenarios that seemed impossible just days ago could be in play: Israel reoccupying Gaza, at least temporarily; the return of the Palestinian Authority to the enclave; international peacekeepers; a demilitarized Hamas still technically holding government authority.

“We need to see how long it will take to destroy Hamas. And then I believe there will be an international understanding with Israel for the day after,” Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel said in an interview. “But now we need to put all our power into winning this war.”

The Israeli public is widely and furiously behind that goal, for now. “Destroy Gaza,” reads a banner hanging over a highway in the left-leaning city of Tel Aviv. But past wars suggest the mood could shift — and international support could wane — if the expected ground war drags on and produces horrifying body counts.

Israel’s military is more circumspect than its leading politicians have been. The Israel Defense Forces said they are gathering tanks and troops — one of the largest mobilizations in the country’s history — with an operational goal of defeating Hamas and eliminating all senior officials involved. This would amount to a greatly expanded version of previous war aims, in which the IDF pulled out once it completed a target list meant to degrade Hamas’s military capabilities.

Even if Israel does kill every Hamas leader in Gaza and collapse every tunnel, “destroying” the organization may not be possible, experts said. Hamas has leaders who are exiled but active and known to move around between Beirut, Istanbul and Doha, Qatar. And Hamas supporters can be found not just in Gaza but also throughout the West Bank, and elsewhere.

Israel is not willing to sacrifice any more of its soldiers’ lives than is necessary, said Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. After what could be a brutal invasion, staying in Gaza to govern will have no appeal.

A restoration of the authority, which is already viewed by many Palestinians as a corrupt agent of Israeli security agencies, would need to be carefully managed, he said. Its legitimacy would take another blow if Israel is seen as simply ushering in Palestinian Authority security forces when the IDF is ready to leave.

Some analysts said the recent thaw in Israel’s relations with Arab states could provide a way. Before the Hamas attack, Saudi Arabia was talking to the Biden administration about establishing ties with Israel. It’s possible that Riyadh could play a role in brokering the Palestinian Authority’s arrival in Gaza City.

But the willingness of Persian Gulf states, and other governments, to help Israel craft an endgame may depend on how the Gaza war concludes. The world was shocked by Hamas’s brutality, but experience shows that civilian casualties and humanitarian agony in Gaza will erode public support.

Description: The secretary of state appealed to the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Egypt to tamp down anger over Israel’s retaliation and to assist in humanitarian aid

Content: “I heard a lot of good ideas about some of the things we need to do moving forward,” Blinken told reporters on Sunday following his meetings with the two leaders. But differences of views emerged immediately on Israel’s right to wage a massive offensive in Gaza, which both Sisi and Mohammed raised concerns about.

The top U. S. diplomat is hopscotching the Middle East with the goal of convincing Arab partners to condemn Hamas’s horrific assault in Israel and refrain from stoking domestic unrest in response to Israel’s devastating bombing campaign in Gaza. The violence has resulted in the death of more than 1,300 Israelis and more than 2,600 Palestinians.

On Saturday, U. S. officials announced that they had reached an agreement with Cairo for a temporary opening at the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt for U.S. citizens seeking to flee the violence and Israeli bombardment. The announcement resulted in scores of the estimated 500- to 600 Palestinian Americans in Gaza rushing to the border, but none have been able to cross into Egypt amid contradictory remarks between U.S. and Egyptian officials about why the border won’t reopen.

The Rafah border crossing — the only egress that Israel does not control — has also remained closed to critical supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine that aid groups and friendly nations, with Egypt’s coordination, are trying to send into Gaza. Israeli airstrikes damaged the crossing last week, and Israel was unwilling to commit to not striking aid vehicles that enter Gaza, a diplomatic official told The Post Saturday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.

“Egypt has put in place a lot of material support for people in Gaza, and Rafah will be opened,” Blinken said about his discussions with Sisi on the border. “We’re putting in place with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel, with others, the mechanism by which to get the assistance in, and to get it to people who need it.”

“You said that you are a Jewish person and I am an Egyptian person who grew up next to Jews in Egypt,” Sisi said. “They have never been subjected to any form of oppression or targeting and it has never happened in our region that Jews were targeted in recent or old history.”

Sisi, an authoritarian leader, has harshly cracked down on Islamists in Egypt. Still, Christian churches and religious leaders have frequently come under attack by Islamist extremists — and there are only a handful of Egyptian Jews left in the country. Tens of thousands of Jews left Egypt under pressure from the government of Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and 1960s.

While Sisi denounced Hamas’s assault on Israelis, he blamed Israel for driving Palestinians to desperation given the lack of progress toward a two-state solution. After Sisi met with his national security council earlier Sunday, his office put out a statement calling for an international summit “to study the future of the Palestinian cause.” Blinken told reporters he supported the idea but “we have to get through this crisis first.”

As the only country that maintains strong communications with Israel, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, Egypt has been a key interlocutor during past flare-ups of violence. Cairo brokered the cease-fire in May 2021 that ended an 11-day outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas that left more than 250 people dead.

That influence is a cornerstone of arguments in Cairo and in Washington for the continued provision of $1.3 billion in U. S. military aid to Egypt annually, despite the Sisi government’s abysmal human rights record. When Biden first came to office in 2021, pledging to put human rights at the center of his foreign policy, the bilateral relationship took a frostier turn. But when Egypt stepped in to mediate a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in May of that year, Biden phoned him twice in one week.

The Egyptian public is staunchly supportive of the Palestinian cause, and Egypt has pushed for a two-state solution to the long-simmering conflict. But Cairo, supremely concerned with internal security, has also played a role in enforcing Israel’s 16-year blockade of Gaza — particularly after Sisi took power in a military coup in 2013. In the early years of his presidency, Sisi was focused on stamping out the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and saw Hamas, with its Islamist orientation, as an ally of the Brotherhood, Elgindy said. The Israel-Gaza war in 2014 lasted for weeks in part because Cairo was “dragging its feet” to punish Hamas, he added.

As Israel continues to bombard Gaza, and pro-Palestinian protests around the world showcase the anger of the Arab street, Egypt has sought to be a voice of calm, calling on all parties to de-escalate and to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy, phoning world leaders and hosting top diplomats from countries including Turkey, Germany and Italy in Cairo to convey this message.

Headline: Israeli ground offensive in Gaza could be a ‘bloodbath,’ analysts say

Description: As Gazans flee, Israel’s military leadership readies a broad offensive. But experts in urban warfare warn that the terrain is troublesome and the endgame uncertain.

Content: The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces’ most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “every Hamas fighter” will be “destroyed,” while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.

“I think they’re going to go back in, heavy, and it’s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,” said Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be “dragged out over a much longer period of time” than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.

The IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities — including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people — have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would “end” the  militant group.

Israeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be “impossible” for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an “integrated and coordinated attack” by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.

Gian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel’s offensive is “obviously going to be much larger” now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.

But Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be “exponentially greater” than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in “dog fights” between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.

But he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.

Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has “become very efficient” at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.

Mulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces’ advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas’s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.

Blaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn’t sustainable.

“They didn’t want to go into Gaza again. They didn’t want to occupy it. They didn’t want to be responsible for administrating it,” Misztal said. “But now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?”

A senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel “at this time” — but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “every Hamas fighter” will be “destroyed,” while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.

“I think they’re going to go back in, heavy, and it’s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,” said Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be “dragged out over a much longer period of time” than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.

The IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities — including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people — have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would “end” the  militant group.

Israeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be “impossible” for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an “integrated and coordinated attack” by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.

Gian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel’s offensive is “obviously going to be much larger” now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.

But Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be “exponentially greater” than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in “dog fights” between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.

But he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.

Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has “become very efficient” at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.

Mulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces’ advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas’s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.

Blaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn’t sustainable.

“They didn’t want to go into Gaza again. They didn’t want to occupy it. They didn’t want to be responsible for administrating it,” Misztal said. “But now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?”

A senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel “at this time” — but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power.

Headline: U.S. officials signal pressure on Israel to address Gaza crisis

Description: “We must not lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas’s appalling attacks,” President Biden said Sunday.

Content: That emphasis represented a shift for the Biden administration, which has given blanket support to Israel’s military operations in advance of a ground invasion that human rights groups say will result in large-scale civilian casualties. But there was little sign Sunday of any substantive steps toward easing the situation in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israeli soldiers were “ready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.”

As Secretary of State Antony Blinken touched down in Egypt on Sunday, relief supplies sat at an airport in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, less than an hour’s drive from the border with Gaza. Some of the aid supplies — delivered by regional countries such as Turkey, as well as the United Nations — have been stranded on Egypt’s side of the border for days.

Diplomats and others familiar with the discussions said one of the main obstacles to the delivery of that aid is the Israeli government’s refusal to guarantee that it will not bomb relief trucks. One diplomatic official said negotiations were underway to allow Israel to inspect trucks entering Gaza.

“We are calling on all parties to open the humanitarian corridor — to have a humanitarian pause in the conflict and to open the border, to allow supplies to go into children who need them right now,” Jeremy Hopkins, Egypt representative for UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, said in an interview Sunday.

Touma said her agency had not been able to confirm that water, or some water, had been restored. Gaza receives water through a variety of sources, aside from the public water network, including from private vendors. Desalination plants and pumping stations require fuel, which Israel was still blocking.

Other diplomats were less optimistic than the Biden administration that progress was being made on the humanitarian front. “Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies” even as aid stockpiled in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel itself could be “dispatched with hours,” U. N. Secretary General António Guterres said in a late afternoon statement. “We are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,” he said, and neither the hostages being held by Hamas nor humanitarian aid to Gaza “should become bargaining chips.”

Biden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 2,600 people. Israel also warned more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, an order human rights groups have called impossible.

Biden also said in the interview that Hamas needs to be eliminated entirely but that there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. But the president said he did not think Israel would pursue that path right now.

It said it shut access to an “area up to four kilometers from the northern border with Lebanon” on Sunday morning in response to an “incident” in northern Israel. It asked residents not to enter or approach the area and warned that GPS signals would be restricted.

Headline: Gaza residents face food and water shortages as they flee south

Description: In Gaza, there were scant supplies of food, fuel, water and power and only intermittent phone and internet connections as critical infrastructure collapsed.

Content: “What should I do? Nowhere is safe,” Warda, a mother of three who declined to give her full name for security reasons, said in a phone interview from Gaza City. She was frantically packing a bag so she could flee south, she said, perhaps by foot, because she had no car.

Israel on Friday urged more than a million residents to evacuate northern Gaza, including Gaza City, where Israeli strikes have wiped out families and laid waste to its once-bustling commercial center. The warning prompted a chaotic exodus along treacherous routes to the south, where at least one convoy was bombed on Friday, according to video footage verified by The Washington Post.

The Israeli military said Sunday that it would “not carry out any operations” along a stretch of the main road that runs the length of the Gaza Strip. “Your safety and that of your families matters,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a message shared on X, formerly Twitter.

An estimated 1 million residents are displaced inside Gaza, according to UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees. Residents said Sunday that they did not trust Israel’s assurances that it would refrain from military operations on the road out of Gaza City.

The ministry also issued an “urgent appeal” for countries to send medical delegations to help treat the wounded. It said medical workers in Gaza are among those who have been killed, injured and displaced.

At Gaza’s overwhelmed hospitals, doctors said they were moving patients to the floor to make room for the newly injured, while bodies piled up outside. At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the territory’s largest medical complex, about 30,000 people crowded into the buildings and surrounding parking lot, in the hopes it would keep them safe.

According to several residents, some families were debating whether to stay all in one room, so that they would die together in the event of a strike, or to spread the children out in different homes and in convoys heading south. That way, they said, at least some members of the family might survive.

Israel has vowed to “destroy” Hamas and its senior leadership in Gaza, where it said it was preparing for a “wide range” of offensive plans, including a possible ground invasion. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 — and the enclave is one of two territories, including the occupied West Bank, that Palestinians envisioned as part of a future state.

Humanitarian aid piled up in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, which borders Gaza, and residents flocked to the Rafah crossing in the south. But the border remained closed, despite reports that it would open to allow the evacuation of foreign nationals, including U. S. citizens.

Ahmed, who declined to give his full name for security reasons, fled his home near the border in southeastern Gaza, along with his wife and three children. First, they moved to the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood, but they had to flee again as the strikes intensified. Now they are staying at a UNRWA storage facility in Rafah city.

In Khan Younis on Friday, an Israeli strike hit the home where members of the Ola family had fled. It killed at least 10 members of the family, including Toqa Abu al-Ola, who was eight months pregnant. Ola’s 3-year-old son, Issam, was the only survivor, according to his uncle, Issam Abu Youssef.

“I swear to you: Death is easier than what we are experiencing,” said Haneen Abu Youssef, the child’s aunt. “When you see a child like this, who lost his mother, father, uncle, grandmother and grandfather, the whole family, uncles and aunts. Nothing is left.”

Description: The president’s warning against retaking the enclave is one of his firmest efforts to put a limit on Israel’s actions.

Content: President Biden said in an interview broadcast Sunday that a new Israeli occupation of Gaza would be “a big mistake,” comments that came as Israel is expected to launch a hard-hitting ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.“I think it’d be a big mistake,” Biden said in a response to a question from “60 Minutes” host Scott Pelley. “Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that … it would be a mistake … for Israel to occupy … Gaza again.”

Biden’s warning against reoccupying Gaza amounted to one of his firmest efforts so far to impose a limit on Israel’s actions in retaliation for Hamas attacks that have killed at least 1,400 people. Still, he added, “going in but taking out the extremists — the Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south — is a necessary requirement.”

Biden sought to draw a distinction between Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza and launched a bloody attack on Israel on Oct. 7, and ordinary Palestinians who are now facing dire conditions in the densely populated enclave of over 2 million people, more than half of whom are children.

Even without a formal occupation, Israel controls most aspects of life in Gaza, and most Palestinians are not able to exit the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza after the attacks, cutting off food, water, fuel and electricity, a tactic that human rights groups have said violates the laws of war. Gaza is almost out of fuel, and many residents do not have access to safe drinking water.

Biden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of that has killed more than 2,600 people. The White House is in discussions with Israeli officials about Biden traveling to Israel, potentially as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about private deliberations.

Israeli media reported that during a phone call on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invited Biden to Israel. Officials of both countries are talking about the feasibility of such a trip, which could present logistical and political difficulties if Biden visits while a fierce Israeli incursion into Gaza is underway.

Israel last week urged more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours in advance of its incursion, an order the United Nations called impossible. Hundreds of thousands of Gaza civilians have fled south, while others chose to stay in their homes after hearing reports of airstrikes hitting potential exit routes.

Asked whether Israel would pursue a path toward a Palestinian state after the Hamas attacks, Biden said “not now.” Still, he added, “I think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.”

Palestinian gunmen from Hamas launched their surprise attack more than a week ago after breaking through Israel’s sophisticated border fence. The militants hunted civilians in their homes and cars and took scores of people hostage into Gaza, including some Americans. At least 30 U. S. citizens were killed in the attacks, U.S. officials said.

Biden and his top officials have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors into Gaza to enable fuel and food to come in. Israel’s energy minister, Israel Katz, said Sunday that Netanyahu and Biden have reached a deal to restore water supplies to some parts of southern Gaza.

When asked whether it was time for a cease-fire, given the number of Palestinian civilians who have already been killed in the aerial counterattack, Biden said Israel has a duty to respond to the horrific attacks.

“Israel is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust,” Biden said. “Israel has to respond. They have to go after Hamas. Hamas is a bunch of cowards. They’re hiding behind the civilians.”

Biden, who has spent much of his 50-plus years in politics steeped in foreign policy, has always been firmly pro-Israel even as some parts of the Democratic Party have increasingly questioned the U. S. military and diplomatic support for the country.

Some liberals have raised concerns over Israel’s years-long punishing blockade of Gaza and its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu has also formed the most far-right government in Israel’s history, sought to overhaul its independent judiciary and all but dismissed the idea of a two-state solution.

“I’m confident that Israel is going to act under … the rules of war,” Biden said, a statement he has made multiple times in the past week. “There’s standards that democratic institutions and countries go by. And so I’m confident that there’s going to be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water.”

Headline: Palestinian American boy stabbed to death in hate crime, sheriff says

Description: Authorities say the conflict between Israel and Gaza was a factor in the killing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in Illinois who was stabbed 26 times.

Content: On Saturday, a week after Hamas militants launched a devastating attack on Israel, Czuba allegedly knocked on the Palestinian family’s door just after 11 a.m. When the mother, Hanaan Shahin, answered, Czuba assaulted her with a serrated military-style knife while yelling anti-Muslim statements, forcing her to run to the bathroom to call 911, according to local authorities and the family’s statements at a news conference on Sunday.

When Shahin emerged from the bathroom after calling police, according to the accounts, she found Czuba attacking her 6-year-old son, Wadea Alfayoumi, who later died of his wounds. He had been stabbed 26 times, the Will County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Shahin, 32, was stabbed at least a dozen times and remains hospitalized in serious condition, the family said.

When authorities arrived, Czuba was sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration to his forehead, according to the sheriff’s office. He was taken to a hospital for treatment but did not make any statements to detectives when later questioned, the sheriff’s office added.

President Biden said in a statement that he was “sickened” to hear of the deadly attack in Illinois, which “stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.”

Before the service, speakers implored elected officials and members of the news media to employ greater caution, compassion and clarity in the days ahead because their roles are pivotal in fostering an environment that can give way to hate crimes. Speakers demanded an apology from President Biden for claiming to have seen photos of alleged Hamas-driven atrocities that his administration later clarified he had not seen.

“There’s more than just a man that stabbed a 6-year-old boy here,” Imam Omar Suleiman said. “I want you to think about what was in his head. What type of hate has to be manufactured in the head of a man for him to stand over a 6-year-old boy and stab him 26 times?”

The attack came a week after Hamas militants raided communities in southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people there and injuring more than 3,842, authorities said. Palestinian officials said 2,670 people in Gaza have been killed and 9,600 wounded after Israel began a bombing campaign ahead of an expected ground invasion.

The brutality of the latest outbreak of warfare has unleashed language from all sides that is so hateful and dehumanizing that it has shocked even longtime observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. International peace activists repeatedly have warned that the ugly rhetoric could inspire violent retaliations in the United States, citing dark precedents such as the targeting of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the increase in antisemitic incidents after previous flare-ups involving Israel.

In the past few days, Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups have documented vandalism or bomb threats at synagogues and mosques, along with hateful messages and swastikas scrawled in their communities. Arab and Muslim rights groups say they have fielded calls from people reporting that they have been fired or silenced for expressing pro-Palestinian views.

Authorities gave few details about Czuba. As news of his arrest spread, people who live nearby said in community forums on Facebook that Czuba had long alarmed residents with yard signs telegraphing his “extreme” views. One woman wrote that she had alerted local officials about the “unhinged” man. The Post contacted the woman seeking details but did not receive an immediate reply.

The Palestinian tenants had seen the signs but did not understand their symbolism and had not experienced the landlord’s extremist side until recently, said Yousef Hannon, an uncle and family spokesman who was sitting with the slain child’s father, Odai Alfayoumi, during a phone interview.

Wadea was born in the United States to Palestinian parents who moved here more than a decade ago and have since divorced. The extended family, which has roots in both the West Bank and Gaza, already was reeling this week from the perils faced by relatives who are fleeing the Israeli siege and retaliatory strikes that followed the Hamas-led attack. Hannon said they never imagined that the tentacles of war would stretch all the way to the Chicago suburbs.

Headline: Russia releases four Ukrainian children after mediation by Qatar
Publish Date: Monday, October 16, 2023 at 05:30 AM

Description: Russian President Vladimir Putin was accused of war crimes over the forced relocation of Ukrainian children. Qatar’s successful intervention could lead to other reunifications.

Content: KYIV — Russia has agreed to free four Ukrainian children — ranging in age from 2 to 17 — and allow them to return them to their families in Ukraine after Qatar intervened as a mediator, according to a government official briefed on the matter. Two of the children are now back with relatives and two others are expected to be reunited with their families in the coming days, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations.

“We welcome today’s positive news, about the reunification of children with their families in Ukraine through Qatari mediation efforts,” Lolwah Al-Khater, Qatar’s minister of state for international cooperation said in a statement. In recent weeks, Qatari officials have been in “continuous dialogue with our Ukrainian and Russian counterparts,” she said.

They also shine a diplomatic spotlight on Qatar. The small Persian Gulf country has often served as a key negotiator in global crises and could play an outsize role in negotiations regarding the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.

Some senior Hamas leaders also live in Qatar, giving Doha incentive to show it is an effective diplomatic intermediary and not a safe haven for alleged terrorists. “Qatar’s role appears contradictory because it is one of the United States major non-NATO allies but it also retains ties to entities that the U. S. sanctions like Hamas, the Taliban and Iran,” said Elham Fakhro, a research associate at Chatham House, the London-based think tank.

“Qatar aims to use its diplomacy to mediate between these different actors and grow its reputation as a global diplomatic broker, with some success,” Fakhro said. At this moment, “they’ll be trying to remind Western states and the U. S. of why their role is useful [and] needed.”

In March, judges of the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, and accused them of war crimes, saying the two bear individual responsibility for the “unlawful deportation” and “unlawful transfer” of Ukrainian children to Russia.

The full scope of the transfer of children to Russia is not clear. The official said a Ukrainian list contains the names of thousands of children while a Russian list merely has hundreds — a discrepancy that may make it difficult to find and return all of the children sought by Ukraine.

Forcibly moving children or stripping them of their identity is generally considered to be a war crime, but the ICC warrants are unlikely to result in any court appearances unless Putin or Lvova-Belova travel to a country willing to arrest them.

The four Ukrainian children returning home this week are the first to be released as part of Qatar’s negotiations because “all parties agreed they found their parents, documents all matched [and] they could be reunited,” the official said.

The 2-year-old, who will return to the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine, was in the hospital — and just 6 months old — when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and “lost contact with his mother,” according to the official.

The two have since been reunited in Russia and are expected to travel to Ukraine this week. Details of how or when the then-infant was transferred to Russian custody are unclear. Russian forces occupied some parts of Zhytomyr region in the first weeks of the war before being forced to retreat.

A 7-year-old boy, who has been staying in a children’s home in Russia, was recently reunited with his grandmother, who traveled to Russia through Estonia, the official said. The pair is now on their way back to Ukraine. The boy’s mother, who was arrested in Russia, remains in custody there. It was not clear when or why she was detained.

Some other Ukrainian children held in Russia have also been released to their parents on a case-by-case basis, usually after a relative traveled to Russia and personally escorted them home, a task that can be difficult, dangerous and financially impossible for many Ukrainian families.

Headline: What is UNRWA, the U.N. agency in Gaza struggling to help Palestinians?
Publish Date: Monday, October 16, 2023 at 11:05 AM

Description: The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, says it is no longer able to provide aid in Gaza as supplies dwindle and strikes continue.

Content: Amid a spiraling crisis in Gaza, where deadly Israeli strikes have forced more than 1 million residents from their homes, one key U. N. agency in the enclave has been working — and now struggling — to protect and support civilians.The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, warned that it is no longer able to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza. “We are on the verge of collapse,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Sunday.

“Gaza is being strangled and it seems that the world right now has lost its humanity,” the agency’s commissioner general said. The Israeli siege of the enclave has sapped its essential resources, Lazzarini said, adding that “not one drop of water, not one grain of wheat, not a liter of fuel” has been allowed into the Gaza Strip for more than a week. Without those supplies, the agency cannot continue its operations, he said.

Almost 2,700 people have been killed in Gaza, and about 9,600 have been injured in Israeli strikes, following the deadly Oct. 7 rampage by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. In Gaza, nearly a million have been displaced — with 400,000 sheltering in overwhelmed and ill-equipped UNRWA school buildings, the agency said.

The agency has specific eligibility guidelines for who can register: A person whose “normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.”

The descendants of male Palestinian refugees are also eligible, according to the agency’s website, which says about 5.9 million Palestinians are eligible for its services. UNRWA aid and services are available in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon. There are about 2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 3 million in the West Bank, according to a 2022 U. S. estimate.

Most of the funding for UNRWA comes from “voluntary contributions” from U. N. member states, with a small portion of its financing coming from the U.N.’s regular budget. Its mandate has been repeatedly renewed “in the absence of a solution to the Palestine refugee problem,” it says. The U.N. renewed the mandate in December until June 2026.

The schools aim to ensure students become “confident, innovative, questioning, thoughtful, and open-minded, to uphold human values and tolerance, proud of their Palestinian identity and contributing positively to the development of society and the global community,” the agency says.

Since the conflict broke out, at least 400,000 displaced people in Gaza are now sheltering in UNRWA schools and buildings, Lazzarini said in a statement Sunday, adding that the buildings are not equipped as emergency shelters. “We have reports in our logistics base, for example, where hundreds of people are just sharing one toilet,” he said.

The way the siege in Gaza is being imposed by Israel is “nothing else than collective punishment,” he said, criticizing the bombing of civilian infrastructure in densely populated areas and the lack of access to essential resources such as fuel, food, electricity and water in Gaza.

The agency said in a Saturday statement that its shelters in Gaza were “no longer safe.” It called on Israel to “protect all civilians sheltering in UNRWA premises across the Gaza Strip,” including in northern Gaza, where Israel’s military has told more than a million Palestinians to evacuate south — though doing so has proved difficult and dangerous for many.

UNRWA said that many Gazans “will not be able to flee the area,” particularly women, children, and the elderly and disabled. “They have no choice and must be protected at all times,” it added.

Lazzarini said that the agency has lost 14 staff members in the conflict, including teachers, engineers, guards, psychologists, an engineer and a gynecologist. More than 13,000 staff members were displaced, and the team relocated to Rafah, in southern Gaza, after the evacuation directive.

Description: Despite reports of a deal to let dual nationals out and aid into Gaza, Israel and Hamas announced that there would be no cease-fire, dashing the hopes of hundreds.

Content: U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.

Blinken then joined a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet when the country’s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington’s unequivocal support for Israel.

Earlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.

Egypt also believed a deal had been reached with the United States and Israel to open the crossing for almost five hours on Monday, to allow 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza and foreign passport holders to leave the strip, according to a person with knowledge of Egyptian diplomatic efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.

Several hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.

“If we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,” said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.

One resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. “It fell in the sand,” he said. “If it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.”

At the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration’s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East — essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.

In Israel, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation’s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.

Israeli officials said Monday that  the military was holding a number of gunmen that it captured during the attack. The Israel Defense Forces was also reviewing body-camera footage taken from some of the prisoners, as well as from slain Hamas fighters, giving the army more insight into their movements, planning and communications, Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said.

In Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza.

S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration’s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East — essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.

In Israel, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation’s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.

In Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza.

Description: Despite reports of a deal to let dual nationals out and aid into Gaza, Israel and Hamas announced that there would be no cease-fire, dashing the hopes of hundreds.

Content: U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.

Blinken then joined a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet when the country’s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington’s unequivocal support for Israel.

Earlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.

Several hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.

“If we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,” said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.

Description: The president warns against occupying Gaza.

Content: But increasingly, the president and his team have also made fairly gentle appeals for Israeli caution. Over the weekend, Biden delivered a warning amid questions of what an Israeli victory over Hamas might look like, what the Jewish state’s endgame could be as it pounds Gaza Strip rubble into gravel and sets in motion what experts expect to be an unprecedented ground war in Gaza.

Asked whether he disagrees with Israel’s decision to cut off food, electricity and water to Gaza in a policy of “complete siege,” Biden said “I'm confident that there's gonna be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water.”

“One of the things that we learned is that you have to really think through next steps,” he told Nick Schifrin. “You have to be very thoughtful about that because they will have long-term implications. Don’t operate on reflex activity. Think through what you’re going to do, what implications it’s going to have for the country, for the region, and beyond.”

“Russia has agreed to free four Ukrainian children — ranging in age from 2 to 17 — and allow them to return them to their families in Ukraine after Qatar intervened as a mediator, according to a government official briefed on the matter. Two of the children are now back with relatives and two others are expected to be reunited with their families in the coming days, the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations, said,” Siobhán O’Grady reports.

“With less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses, the 2024 presidential candidates were required to file their third-quarter fundraising reports by midnight Sunday. Former president Donald Trump reported a huge cash advantage over his Republican rivals at the end of September, a haul bolstered by his pleas to his donors to aid his effort as he is set to face multiple legal trials next year,” Maeve Reston, Clara Ence Morse and Hannah Knowles report.

“Now the fates of the two issues may be linked in coming weeks on Capitol Hill, as the Biden administration weighs combining aid for those two countries, as well as funding for Taiwan and the U. S. border, into one complicated package that a still-to-be-named new House speaker would have to shepherd,” the Wall Street Journal’s Sabrina Siddiqui and John McCormick report.

“Fred Daibes, the New Jersey real estate tycoon at the center of an international scandal threatening the career of Senator Robert Menendez, has found his way out of more than one tough spot over the course of his tumultuous life,” the New York Times’s Elise Young and Tracey Tully report.

“Biden’s administration sold off more than 40 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last year to help limit rising fuel prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, leaving the stockpile at its lowest levels since the early 1980s. That’s fueling Republican accusations that Biden has left the U. S. vulnerable to a disruption of global oil supplies — at a time when Hamas’ terrorist attacks in Israel are stoking fears of a wider regional war disrupting fuel shipments from the Middle East,” Politico’s Ben Lefebvre reports.

Headline: How Hamas’s carefully planned Israel attack devolved into a chaotic rampage

Description: What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.

Content: TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.

Hamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.

Miri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.

It was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.

“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”

In a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”

The militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.

The Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.

As the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.

Barakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.

“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”

In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.

At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.

It was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.

“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”

In a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”

The militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.

The Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.

As the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.

Barakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.

“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”

In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.

Description: What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.

Content: TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.

Headline: Deadly attacks in Belgium, France renew European terrorism fears
Publish Date: Monday, October 16, 2023 at 09:03 PM

Description: Both a shooting in Brussels and a stabbing at a French high school are being treated as terrorist attacks.

Content: BRUSSELS — Police fatally shot the gunman who killed two people in the Belgian capital in a terrorist attack, authorities said Tuesday, ending a manhunt that had left the city on edge, but doing little to ease fears of an uptick in political violence across Europe. The attack in Brussels came days after a teacher was fatally stabbed at French high school in what authorities are investigating as a terrorist attack. And countries across Europe have been on guard for political violence that might spill over from the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Monday’s attack in Brussels targeted three Swedish nationals, killing two and wounding one, on an evening when Sweden was playing Belgium in a Europe 2024 qualifier soccer match. That game was suspended and the city put on high alert while police searched for the attacker.

“Last night, three people left for what was supposed to be a wonderful soccer party. Two of them lost their lives in a brutal terrorist attack,” Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said at an early morning news conference. “Their lives were cut short in full flight, cut down by extreme brutality.”

De Croo said the attacker was Tunisian and had been “staying illegally in our country.” Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne said the man had been denied asylum in 2019 and had been previously suspected of involvement in human trafficking and being a risk to state security. He suggested that the attacker may have targeted nationals of Sweden because of Quran burnings there, which have led to threats and protests.

In a video that emerged after the shooting, a man asserted responsibility for the attack and identified himself as a member of the Islamic State extremist group — though Belgium’s federal prosecutor said he was probably a lone wolf.

“We all have a vulnerability. It’s what comes with being a democracy, a rule-of-law state where there are individuals who can decide at a given moment to commit the worst acts,” Macron told reporters while visiting the Albanian capital, Tirana, according to Agence France-Presse.

Although neither of the attacks appears to have strong links to the war between Israel and Hamas, many European capitals have heightened their security over concern that the conflict will spur violence in their own countries. In recent days, cultural landmarks in France and schools in multiple countries have received bomb threats, while authorities reported a rise in antisemitic hate crimes.

Since Hamas launched its attack on Israel, the European Union has conveyed conflicting messages — over whether aid to Palestinians should continue, over whether Israel needs to emphasize restraint — inviting criticism from all sides.

“The E. U. will have little ability to influence events unfolding in Israel and Gaza but could be seriously impacted by them,” wrote Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.

Although Belgian officials said the gunman in Monday’s attack had a criminal record and was known by local authorities, federal prosecutor Frédéric Van Leeuw said, “We did not have indications that the person needed to be watched.”

The suspect in France had likewise been known to security authorities — French intelligence officials had been wiretapping his conversations and had interacted with him a day before, but said they had no evidence on which to detain him before the stabbing.

For France and Belgium, the attacks are a reminder of a spate of terrorist violence in 2015 and 2016. In July, six men were convicted for their roles in a 2016 attack that killed 32 and injured hundreds in Brussels. A year before that assault, a team of gunmen claiming allegiance to the Islamic State carried out attacks in Paris that killed over 100 people.

Despite measures put in place to stop those kinds of attacks from happening again, the attacker in Brussels managed to kill two people and escape the scene of the crime, sowing fear across the city.

The Swedish team donned black arm bands in their match on Tuesday and posted on social media: “Yesterday we tragically lost two blue-and-yellow supporters, on site in Brussels to do something that should be a matter of course — to support our Swedish national team in the blue and yellow national team shirt. Our thoughts go out to all the loved ones of the victims.”

The attacker remained at large overnight. According to the federal prosecutor’s office, a witness called Brussels police at 8 a.m. Tuesday to say the suspect was in a cafe in the Schaerbeek district. “The police arrived at the scene and during the intervention, the suspect was shot,” a statement said. “The emergency services also arrived at the scene and tried to resuscitate the man.” He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Description: The U.S. Secret Service arrested more than 30 people during a protest outside the White House on Monday over the Israel-Gaza war.

Content: Jewish protesters and allies were arrested Monday after they blocked entrances to the White House to demand that President Biden urge a cease-fire in the Israel-Gaza war. The U.S. Secret Service arrested more than 30 people during the demonstration for alleged unlawful entry, such as crossing safety barricades, or for allegedly blocking entrances, Special Agent Steve Kopek, a spokesperson for the agency, said in a statement.

The demonstration, organized by Jewish groups IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace, came as Israel prepares for a major military offensive in the Gaza Strip amid an intensifying humanitarian crisis.

Biden has expressed his steadfast support for Israel since the Oct. 7 attack, when gunmen from Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, broke through Israel’s border, killing more than 1,400 people and taking others into Gaza as hostages, including some American citizens.

Since then, airstrikes by the Israeli military on the Gaza Strip have killed more than 2,700 people and wounded almost 10,000. Israel also announced a full siege of Gaza — where more than 2 million people live, more than half of whom are children — by cutting off essential resources such as food, water, electricity and fuel.

Those protesting Monday recited Kaddish, the mourner’s prayer, sang Jewish songs and chanted “Not in our name!,” said IfNotNow communications director Matan Arad-Neeman, 25, of New York City.

“Many of us are in mourning. We have loved ones who were killed and kidnapped,” said Arad-Neeman, who said an extended family member was killed in the recent violence. “We’re also angry that our grief is being weaponized and that Israel is on the brink of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians in Gaza.”

Arad-Neeman, who is Israeli American, said that although he is mourning alongside so many others, he does not want more violence to create more grieving Israeli or Palestinian families.

“All of us are hoping and praying for a future where Israeli and Palestinians can live free of the fear of violence, and in true equality and justice,” Arad-Neeman said. “That’s why we’re here.”

Description: Biden walks a fine line as he tries to balance unwavering support for Israel with concern for conditions in Gaza

Content: Democrats have been almost entirely unified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas hunted civilians in their homes and cars, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages, including some Americans, into Gaza. The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.

Biden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel’s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians. On Sunday he named a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, and the White House has begun emphasizing its work to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow through Gaza and that Palestinian civilians can flee areas Israel is targeting.

This is not the first time Biden’s ironclad support of Israel has put him at odds with the more liberal wing of his party, as Democrats have grown increasingly willing to challenge Israel as its government has become more right-wing. Some Democrats have raised concerns or outright opposition to U. S. military support to Israel, pointing to its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank and its years-long punishing blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also formed the most far-right government in Israel’s history, though that has been replaced since the attacks by a unity government that includes centrist parties.

Biden has said Israel has a duty to respond to the attacks, which he has called as consequential as the Holocaust, but he seemed to impose limits when he said during a television interview airing Sunday that Israel reoccupying Gaza would be “a big mistake.” Israel captured the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war, but it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, leading to a Hamas takeover of the territory two years later.

A White House summary of Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U. S. coordination with the United Nations, as well as Egypt, Jordan, Israel and other countries to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. “President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,” the readout said.

Biden and his top aides are focused on preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflagration and have repeatedly warned other actors, such as Iran, not to get involved. They are also concerned that anger in Arab countries whose citizens are highly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause could set off such a conflict, according to a senior administration official, who  spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.

“They know an Israeli ground incursion that has really high casualties could inflame not just the situation among Palestinians but in the broader region,” said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. “There’s a genuine concern that the threat of Hamas needs to be eliminated … but at the same time, how do you make sure that innocent Palestinians aren’t targeted?”

“J Street adamantly rejects the charge that it threatened endorsees,” said the organization’s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. “Over the past 10 days, we’ve spoken to many members of Congress to explain why support for Israel, condemnation of Hamas and recognition of Israel’s right to defend itself are core values of the organization. We want those we support to hear how important it is to us that our partners stand up for Israel even as we also speak out on the crisis now facing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”

The conflict has inflamed tensions in more direct ways as well. Capitol Police last week had a meeting with nine progressive Democrats, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush, about their safety. A Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said the lawmakers are receiving significantly more threats than they have in the past. The meeting was put together by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N. Y.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.).

The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.

But a small yet growing number of Democrats have begun urging the Biden administration to do more to encourage Israel to limit civilian casualties in its counterattack and ensure that innocent Palestinians are able to receive basic needs and humanitarian assistance. The shifting dynamic could create political and diplomatic complications for Biden amid the announcement late Monday that he will visit Israel.

Biden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel’s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians.

“This is a special moment where we would really encourage the Biden administration to weigh in with Netanyahu and say that we don’t want to have an even greater humanitarian crisis right now,” Schakowsky, who represents a district in Chicago and its northern suburbs with a significant Jewish population, said Friday. “We’re very worried about that.”

A White House summary of Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U.

“They know an Israeli ground incursion that has really high casualties could inflame not just the situation among Palestinians but in the broader region,” said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. “There’s a genuine concern that the threat of Hamas needs to be eliminated … but at the same time, how do you make sure that innocent Palestinians aren’t targeted?”

“J Street adamantly rejects the charge that it threatened endorsees,” said the organization’s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. “Over the past 10 days, we’ve spoken to many members of Congress to explain why support for Israel, condemnation of Hamas and recognition of Israel’s right to defend itself are core values of the organization. We want those we support to hear how important it is to us that our partners stand up for Israel even as we also speak out on the crisis now facing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”

The conflict has inflamed tensions in more direct ways as well. Capitol Police last week had a meeting with nine progressive Democrats, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush, about their safety. A Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said the lawmakers are receiving significantly more threats than they have in the past. The meeting was put together by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N. Y.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.).

ARTICLE NUMBER 86

Headline: Democrats’ unity starts cracking on Israel-Gaza conflict
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 12:08 AM

Description: Biden walks a fine line as he tries to balance unwavering support for Israel with concern for conditions in Gaza

Content: Democrats have been almost entirely unified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas hunted civilians in their homes and cars, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages, including some Americans, into Gaza. The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.

But a small yet growing number of Democrats have begun urging the Biden administration to do more to encourage Israel to limit civilian casualties in its counterattack and ensure that innocent Palestinians are able to receive basic needs and humanitarian assistance. The shifting dynamic could create political and diplomatic complications for Biden amid the announcement late Monday that he will visit Israel.

Biden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel’s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians. On Sunday he named a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, and the White House has begun emphasizing its work to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow through Gaza and that Palestinian civilians can flee areas Israel is targeting.

This is not the first time Biden’s ironclad support of Israel has put him at odds with the more liberal wing of his party, as Democrats have grown increasingly willing to challenge Israel as its government has become more right-wing. Some Democrats have raised concerns or outright opposition to U. S. military support to Israel, pointing to its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank and its years-long punishing blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also formed the most far-right government in Israel’s history, though that has been replaced since the attacks by a unity government that includes centrist parties.

Biden has said Israel has a duty to respond to the attacks, which he has called as consequential as the Holocaust, but he seemed to impose limits when he said during a television interview airing Sunday that Israel reoccupying Gaza would be “a big mistake.” Israel captured the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war, but it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, leading to a Hamas takeover of the territory two years later.

“This is a special moment where we would really encourage the Biden administration to weigh in with Netanyahu and say that we don’t want to have an even greater humanitarian crisis right now,” Schakowsky, who represents a district in Chicago and its northern suburbs with a significant Jewish population, said Friday. “We’re very worried about that.”

A White House summary of Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U. S. coordination with the United Nations, as well as Egypt, Jordan, Israel and other countries to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. “President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,” the readout said.

Biden and his top aides are focused on preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflagration and have repeatedly warned other actors, such as Iran, not to get involved. They are also concerned that anger in Arab countries whose citizens are highly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause could set off such a conflict, according to a senior administration official, who  spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.

Description: The trip to show support comes as Israel mourns victims of Hamas’s attack and readies a Gaza invasion that some warn could devastate civilians.

Content: Biden will also visit Jordan, where he plans to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has endured Israeli airstrikes that have killed more than 2,700 Palestinians.

Hamas has taken scores of hostages into Gaza, including an unknown number of Americans. Biden will work to get as much information about the hostage situation as possible during his trip, White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing with reporters Monday evening.

Kirby emphasized that the United States had not sought assurances that Israel would not launch its ground invasion while Biden was visiting the country. “We’re not dictating terms or operational directions to the Israelis,” Kirby said. “We don’t want to see escalation. We want to make sure humanitarian assistance begins to flow.”

Still, U. S. officials waited to announce Biden’s travel to Israel on Monday night until they received commitments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a humanitarian package, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken received assurances during a marathon meeting in Tel Aviv this week and then made the announcement that Biden would be visiting.

During the 7½-hour meeting, Israeli and U. S. officials set up separate rooms and passed papers between the two sides, negotiating over humanitarian issues including getting aid into Gaza and creating safe zones for Palestinian civilians, said a State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.

Though Blinken hailed an agreement on humanitarian issues, his announcement included few details, probably an indication that differences remain between the two allies. The provision of humanitarian aid is sensitive in Israel, especially among far-right politicians tied to Netanyahu who have pressed him to wage a scorched-earth campaign in Gaza in response to the terrorist attack.

The White House is deeply concerned about the conflict spiraling into a broader regional conflagration, and Biden has warned other actors, particularly Iran, not to jump in. His visit to Israel could underline that message.

Officials are also worried that anger in Arab countries, where many citizens have deep sympathy for the Palestinian cause, could boil over and create pressure for their leaders to take action against Israel.

Biden has repeatedly emphasized his support for Israel and said the country has a duty to respond to the horrific attack, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas breached Israel’s sophisticated border fence in several places before hunting civilians in their homes and cars and shooting people indiscriminately.

But the president and his top aides have also sought to draw a distinction between Hamas and Palestinian civilians. In recent days, they have stressed their efforts to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow into Gaza and to secure a humanitarian corridor where Palestinian Americans can leave the densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children.

Israel has said its goal is to eliminate Hamas and has urged more than 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza to avoid being in harm’s way, an order the United Nations called impossible. It also announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, fuel, electricity and water, which human rights groups have said violates international law.

Biden spoke with Sisi on Monday, the White House said, and the two discussed “ongoing efforts to alleviate the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the U. N., Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and other regional partners.”

Egypt has helped broker cease-fires between Israel and Palestine during past incursions and plays a critical role in ongoing efforts to secure humanitarian assistance. And on Egypt’s border with Gaza, the Rafah crossing could be the only way out for Palestinians seeking to flee the enclave amid Israel’s bombardment campaign.

Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave.

But there was confusion over the agreement and the crossing remained closed, deepening frustration and panic among aid groups, who warn that time is running out for wounded and displaced Gazans to receive critical — and, in many cases, lifesaving — supplies.

The planned trip to Israel is in some ways reminiscent of Biden’s visit in February to Kyiv, as he was seeking to dramatically show his support for Ukraine. That trip, too, was aimed at showcasing Biden’s personal support for an ally that had suffered a bloody attack, in Ukraine’s case at the hands of Russia. That visit was kept secret until Biden’s arrival.

Headline: DeSantis is slamming Trump more directly. It’s a tough sell in the GOP.
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 09:00 AM

Description: Running out of time to close the gap, DeSantis has taken an increasingly aggressive approach to Trump, whom he trails by huge margins in the GOP presidential field.

Content: Trailing Trump by huge margins in the GOP presidential primary and running out of time to close the gap, DeSantis has taken an increasingly aggressive approach to his top rival. For months, wary of alienating Trump’s loyal base, DeSantis criticized the former president only when asked and took subtler swings in his stump speeches. But his comments over the past week underscore a shift in posture this fall, with DeSantis routinely knocking Trump by name and sometimes broaching his character.

DeSantis has always pitched himself to voters as a more effective, disciplined version of Trump — an heir to his agenda who is more likely to follow through, less toxic to swing voters and undistracted by personal drama. Now he’s making that case more forcefully and seizing new opportunities to hit Trump as they arise, blasting the former president’s comments of the day on issues ranging from the Israel-Gaza war to six-week abortion bans.

It’s not clear the blunter approach will make a difference for DeSantis, who has fallen far behind Trump since launching his campaign in a more competitive standing and is now fighting for a distant second place with rivals. Polling and focus groups have repeatedly found that most attacks don’t work on Trump and can even backfire as voters who like the former president react defensively.

“I’m gonna say it in here if I get the opportunity,” Kristine Willets, a retiree long torn between Trump and DeSantis, said before heading into Mario’s Sports Bar & Grill with her grandson. “Stop doing that. We don’t care about that.”

Willets came out of the event agreeing with some of DeSantis’s objections: “Trump should have fired [FBI director Chris] Wray,” she said. She raved about DeSantis, declared him “ready” to be president and praised his answer to her question about the war in Ukraine (“We need to end the conflict.”)

“Think of the chaos that was going on in his term,” Willets said. “No one ever had to put up with this stuff Trump put up with.”

DeSantis’s presidential hopes likely rest on people like Willets: Trump voters in Iowa — where DeSantis has focused his resources — who are open to other options in 2024. So far, most Trump supporters have proved difficult to win over.

DeSantis and his allies have sought to criticize Trump as both hard to elect in the general and insufficiently conservative on key issues in the primary — noting that he once allowed transgender women to compete in his Miss Universe pageant or that he didn’t get rid of Anthony S. Fauci, who helped lead the U. S. coronavirus response under Trump and inspires hatred from many Republicans.

Republican candidates and groups aiming to defeat Trump have tried many lines of attack and DeSantis is no exception. Asked recently on the campaign trail why someone should vote for him over Trump — in a moment promoted on social media by a pro-DeSantis super PAC — the governor ticked swiftly through a list of arguments over five minutes, saying that he has a stronger record of fulfilling policy promises; can serve longer in office; and is more capable of staffing an effective administration.

DeSantis’s support among voters favorable to Trump has steadily dropped from a high point early this year, before he officially joined the presidential race. Many of those Republicans have gravitated back toward Trump as he racks up criminal indictments — and DeSantis himself has echoed Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that the prosecutions are politically motivated, mostly declining to criticize the former president on that front.

Asked why DeSantis has sharpened his criticisms lately, campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo — who recently called Trump’s comments on Israel “disturbing and disqualifying” — said DeSantis “has simply been pointing out how the former president isn’t the same guy as he used to be” and responding to off-script blunders.

At first, DeSantis avoided criticizing Trump to the point that even veiled jabs made news. In March, when Trump was indicted in New York, DeSantis made headlines for his pointed allusion to the sordid allegations against Trump — “hush money to a porn star” — even as he joined broad GOP condemnations of the case.

But they were less frequent and DeSantis advisers said their priority was introducing DeSantis positively rather than aggressively contrasting with Trump. And DeSantis didn’t criticize Trump by name in his stump speeches, which usually decried a “culture of losing” in the GOP.

“We have the Donald Trump on the teleprompter, where he’s reading what’s on there,” DeSantis told reporters in New Hampshire last week. “Then you have Donald Trump when he gets off that teleprompter, and that’s the real Donald Trump.” He accused Trump of making the conflict in Israel “about him” with his criticisms of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Headline: Biden gives fewer press interviews. But he woos more influencers.

Description: White House says its media strategy reflects Americans’ habits. Critics say president is avoiding tough questions.

Content: The White House specified that Biden wanted the video to emphasize what his administration has done to get more EVs on the road — the sort of instruction that is anathema to traditional news organizations. In less than an hour, the video had a million views and it ultimately racked up more than 38 million, becoming Mac’s most-watched post.

“Our communications strategy is ‘all of the above’ — which it must be to break through in a fractured media environment and an era of information overload,” LaBolt said. “We study where Americans get their information and make sure we are meeting them where they are, whether that is traditional newscasts, social media or consumer outlets.”

CBS’s “60 Minutes” also scored exclusive time with the president at last year’s Detroit Auto Show, and correspondent Scott Pelley used it to press Biden on such issues as how he would hold down gas prices amid the Ukraine war. Roughly 10 million people watched the “60 Minutes” segment live, a smaller viewership than four NFL games airing at the same time, according to data collected by the Nielsen company. This past Sunday, “60 Minutes” aired another interview with the president, offering his most direct answers yet to questions about the Israel-Gaza war.

Biden is hardly the first president to turn to nontraditional sources to reach a different audience. Clinton appeared on an MTV town hall in 1994 (where he was asked if he wore boxers or briefs). President Barack Obama appeared on the comedy show “Between Two Ferns” in 2014 (where he was asked, “How does it feel to be the last Black president?”)

Mac said Biden’s burgeoning relationship with TikTokers shows that he is looking to engage with a younger audience, one that is unlikely to turn to traditional sources for its news. He doesn’t see that changing; Mac is in talks with administration officials to record a “crib tour” of the East Wing.

Description: U.S. officials have not presented evidence that Tehran played a direct role in the massacre in Israel, but a bipartisan group is demanding action.

Content: President Biden faces growing pressure from lawmakers in both parties to punish Iran after Hamas’s massacre this month, as the administration tries to support Israel without expanding an already gruesome conflict in the Middle East. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.On Monday night, Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) sent a letter to the White House, signed by more than 110 lawmakers, demanding more aggressive financial sanctions on Iran, pointing to ties between Tehran and the militants who carried out the bloody attack on Israel. Backed by more than 60 House Democrats, the letter said the administration should block Iranian oil sales to other countries such as China, aiming to dry up one of the regime’s key sources of funding.

So far, the White House has not adopted this approach, though its position could change quickly. Any dramatic move against Iran risks intensifying a regional conflict that the Biden administration wants to calm as much as possible, and restricting Iranian oil sales could send global gas prices skyward ahead of next year’s presidential election.

How the administration responds could hinge on what U. S. intelligence agencies ultimately conclude about Iran’s role in Hamas’s attack. U.S. officials previously told The Washington Post that Hamas received weapons and training from Iran, but produced no evidence linking Iran directly to the slaughter. Iran’s foreign minister said Monday that “preemptive action” against Israel from unspecified “leaders of the Resistance” could be expected and that “we cannot be indifferent to the war crimes committed against the people of Gaza.” All 100 senators will be briefed about the Hamas attack and Israel’s war in Gaza on Wednesday by senior administration officials.

“Iran must be held fully accountable for its continued role in funding Hamas and Islamic terror,” states the congressional letter, which praises Biden for his assistance to Israel thus far in the crisis. “We urge the Administration to take all necessary steps to cut off Iranian funding sources. This includes maximum enforcement of all U. S. sanctions, and taking any and all steps to end Iran’s oil trade to China.”

If the United States does decide to punish Iran, the country’s oil revenue would pose an obvious target. (Already, U. S. officials and the Qatari government agreed last week to suspend a $6 billion humanitarian fund for nongovernmental organizations in Iran funded by Iranian oil sales, eliciting a rebuke from Tehran.) Iran is exporting around 1.5 million barrels of oil per day — the vast majority of it to China — in a major increase from the nearly 1 million barrels it was exporting per day at the start of Biden’s term, according to Scott Modell, chief executive officer at the Rapidan Energy Group.

The White House already faces political headwinds from rising gas prices that could threaten Biden’s reelection bid. A sanctions crackdown on Iran, if not offset by more oil from another source, could lead the price of oil to spike by more than $10 a barrel, probably bringing the average price of a gallon of gas from $3.66 to above $4, Modell said.

“It would fly in the face of where the administration has been. The White House has wanted to keep Iranian oil flowing; they want to build on this working détente,” said Modell, who also cautioned that price fluctuations would depend on how long oil traders expect new sanctions to remain in place. “When you’re talking about taking 500,000, or 1 million, barrels per day out, the market will react to that.”

On the Senate floor Monday, top Republicans took repeated aim at the Biden administration’s approach to Tehran. The GOP has been demanding a particularly hard line: Former president Donald Trump last week falsely blamed the Hamas attack on Biden’s move to allow the $6 billion humanitarian fund, even though no money from the fund had been spent and it was limited to humanitarian purposes, with U. S. officials getting veto power over each transaction.

Iran is under one of the most restrictive U. S. sanctions programs in the world. An almost total economic embargo prevents international firms from doing business with Iranian financial institutions or importing Iranian-origin products, among myriad other economic activities. Further restrictions are likely to face resistance from many Democrats wary of inflaming the region further.

“At this extremely delicate moment, it is in the U. S. interest to prevent the latest violence from escalating into a full-blown regional conflict,” said one senior House Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe caucus dynamics. “It would be maddening if hawkish lawmakers with a long-standing goal of fomenting war with Iran succeed in pushing the U.S. into new sanctions and escalation with Iran on this totally fabricated pretext.”

“Iran is already under the heaviest sanction of any country in the world, and has been for a long time,” said Duss, now executive vice president of the Center for International Policy, a D. C.-based think tank. “Piling more sanctions on top of sanctions does not seem to be working, especially when there is such an enormous political cost to removing sanctions when Iran does things we want to do.”

“A lot of sanctions introduced by Congress are duplicative,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign policy think tank, who stressed he had not yet seen the current congressional proposals. “They have no real additional impact on Iran because the items in question are already under sanction. It can make the lawmakers look like they’re doing something even if what they’re doing is not new or impactful.”

Headline: Donors are latest to punish Harvard over response to students’ Israel critique
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 09:08 AM

Description: The Wexner Foundation will stop funding fellowships at the Ivy League institution. Harvard was criticized for responding slowly to a student letter blaming Israel for the Hamas attack.

Content: The Wexner Foundation, a philanthropic organization focused on cultivating Jewish leadership, is cutting ties with Harvard over what it described as the university’s inadequate response to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, which killed at least 1,400 people in Israel. Why are Israel and Hamas at war? A basic explainer.The split is the most recent development in an ongoing controversy at the Ivy League university resulting from a statement signed by a coalition of Harvard student groups in response to the attack, which said that the Israeli government was “entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” Critics have said that Harvard was too slow to respond to the letter and not forceful enough when it did.

The university has become a microcosm of tensions arising at U. S. higher education institutions, where donors have distanced themselves and protests have broken out on campuses — all over responses to the war.

In a Monday letter, the Wexner Foundation wrote that it is “stunned and sickened” by Harvard’s failure to “take a clear and unequivocal stand” against Hamas’s “barbaric murders” of civilians in Israel, particularly after the student letter.

For more than 30 years, The Wexner Foundation, founded by Leslie Wexner, a controversial billionaire retailer, has partnered with the university to fund fellowships for Israeli government and public service professionals to pursue a master’s degree at Harvard Kennedy School. The organization donated more than $2.4 million to Harvard in the 2021 fiscal year, the Boston Globe reported. In the letter this week addressed to the Harvard Board of Overseers, the foundation writes that the two “are no longer compatible partners” and they will seek other ways to develop Israel’s leadership.

In a statement, Harvard Kennedy School pointed to leaders’ recent public condemnations of Hamas and said they are “grateful to the Wexner Foundation for its very longstanding support of student scholarships.”

The Harvard students’ letter was considered incendiary as it did not mention Hamas and blamed the Oct. 7 killings on what they called Israel’s “apartheid regime.” For years, “millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison,” the groups write, invoking an analogy often used by human rights organizations to describe Israel’s blockade on the densely populated strip, which has limited Palestinian movement for more than 15 years. The groups pointed to targeted killings and family separations among other struggles, and called on Harvard to “take action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians.”

Backlash to the letter came swiftly, including from fellow students, prompting some signatories to publicly retract their signatures. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a Harvard graduate, said it was “intellectually weak and morally repugnant,” writing in a statement that, “Terrorism is never justified nor someone else’s fault” and “you can stand up for Palestinian rights while condemning Hamas terrorists.”

When Harvard did not immediately respond to the letter, the university’s former president Lawrence H. Summers wrote on social media that he was “disillusioned and alienated” and that the silence allowed the institution to “appear at best neutral toward acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel.”

Harvard’s President Claudine Gay in a later statement condemned the “terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas,” and added that the student groups that signed the letter do not speak for the university. Harvard Divinity School released a statement on Oct. 11 calling for acknowledging “decades of oppression” faced by Palestinians when considering “the story about Hamas’ horrendous attack on Israeli civilians.”

For the Wexner Foundation and others, the administration’s actions were not forceful enough. A letter from Harvard faculty members said that the student groups’ letter “could have been a teaching moment” to remind students that “some acts such as war crimes are simply wrong.” The statement “fell short” and “failed to condemn the justifications for violence that come from our own campus,” the faculty members wrote.

Kenneth Griffin, a billionaire who pledged $300 million to Harvard earlier this year, urged Harvard to more forcefully defend Israel in a call to a senior Harvard leader, the New York Times reported. Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer and his wife Batia quit the Harvard executive board, saying in a statement to CNN that they “denounce those who seek to place blame on the people of Israel.”

Meanwhile, students accused of signing the letter have faced threats and doxing (publishing a person’s private information on the internet). Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman wrote on social media last week that he had been asked by “a number of CEOs” if Harvard would release the names of members of organizations that issued the letter, so they could avoid hiring them. A billboard truck drove around campus with photos and names of the students said to have signed the letter, labeling them “antisemites.”

The human rights and literary organization PEN America condemned the “harassment of any students, regardless of their viewpoint” and called the campaign against the students “an undeniable threat to freedom of expression.”

Headline: Mideast teeters on the brink of wider war as Iran weighs its options

Description: Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider, more devastating Middle East conflict are growing as clashes with Hezbollah intensify amid warnings from Tehran.

Content: Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider and more devastating Middle East war are growing as clashes with Iranian-backed Hezbollah intensify along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Israel presses ahead with its plans for a ground incursion into Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas. The fears spiked on Tuesday following a strike on a Gaza hospital that appears to have killed hundreds of people, triggering angry denunciations and calls for vengeance across the region. Demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank, marched to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and converged on Israeli diplomatic missions in Turkey and Jordan, blaming the strike on Israel, which has denied responsibility.

The bloodshed fueled already rising tensions between Israel and Iran, which backs Hamas along with an array of allied militias and proxies. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned before the strike that Iran’s militia allies in the “resistance front” could take what he called “preemptive action” to deter an Israeli ground offensive, and the risk is high that an incident such as this could prompt escalatory attacks in revenge. “We have to retaliate from Lebanon,” the demonstrators chanted in Beirut.

Over the past decade, Iran has built up a formidable array of militias and proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in addition to Hamas, and all or any of them could be called on to open up new fronts. Iran also has to calculate whether it can afford to expend the considerable military leverage it derives from these allies in a potentially ruinous conflict for the purpose of defending one of them, Hamas, in Gaza.

Washington has positioned two aircraft carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah, and could also be drawn into the fight if Hezbollah launches a full-scale assault on Israel. Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah forces there, would almost certainly join in; there have already been exchanges of fire along the Syrian border, and activists report that Iranian-allied fighters have been relocating to southern Syria from the east of the country.

The biggest concern, however, is the well-armed, battle-trained and highly disciplined Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, said Michael Horowitz, director of intelligence at Le Beck security consultancy. Hezbollah has amassed between 130,000 and 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, some of which could reach deep into Israeli cities or be used to deliver precision strikes against Israeli military facilities such as air bases, curtailing Israel’s fighting capabilities.

But Israel probably would also inflict massive damage on Lebanon, as it did in the 2006 war and the 1982 invasion of the country. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon that “the price you will pay will be far heavier” than in any previous war.

It appears the Iranians do not want an escalation and are keen to find ways to avoid one, according to a regional diplomat familiar with some of the Iranian conversations with that nation’s allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. While making it clear that their allies are prepared to fight, Iran and Hezbollah have not publicly set red lines for what scenario in Gaza would trigger their involvement — which could range from continued attacks on Gaza, the launch of a ground invasion or only in the event that Hamas is at risk of being completely defeated, the diplomat said.

A senior Hamas official, speaking from Beirut, insisted that Iran was not involved in the Hamas assault, in which at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed and nearly 200 taken hostage. He said Hamas had not anticipated the scale and speed of the collapse of Israel’s defenses and that Hamas was caught off guard also by the ferocity of Israel’s response; over 3,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli airstrikes, according to Palestinian authorities.

“Of course the Iranians help us and train us and give us support, but this operation specifically was very confidential and secret,” said Ali Barakah, who heads Hamas’s international relations department. He described what he said was intended as a “limited operation” to trade Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners and said the expectation was that Israel would conduct limited airstrikes against Gaza before embarking on negotiations.

Built up over decades since the creation of Hezbollah in 1982, the strategy aims to position enough militia firepower on Israel’s borders to deter an Israeli attack on Iran, a long-standing fear that has grown in recent years as Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. The Palestinian cause is central to the strategy and to Iran’s identity as a revolutionary Islamic state.

Over the past two years, Iran has sought to reinforce the strategy with a concept known as “unity of fronts,” under which Hezbollah, Hamas and other regional allies have pledged closer cooperation and mutual defense, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah and Hamas have set up a joint coordination center in Beirut with a view to collaborating in ways that further deter Israel from attacks on any one of them.

Iran almost certainly doesn’t want to risk undermining Hezbollah’s deterrent capabilities for the sake of Gaza, but at the same time it can’t afford to be seen as abandoning its allies if the deterrence is to survive, Knights said.

Headline: As traumatized southern Israel evacuates, residents ponder revenge
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 11:50 AM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/17/israel-sderot-south-evacuation-gaza/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_37 
Description: Sderot has long been on the front lines but the last Hamas attack was something utterly different, and residents want the situation to change.

Content: But this time things are different. Border communities are still reeling from the Hamas-led assault that killed 1,400 Israelis, and now amid the trauma, there is an unwillingness to return to the status quo.

“We want to make these terrorist attacks stop,” said Maor Ben Haim, 34, as he loaded his six-months-pregnant wife and children onto an evacuation bus  over the weekend. “That’s it. We were too patient, too gentle. I think the nation is now united to do what  should have been done a long time ago.”

Israel has said it is ready to crush Hamas, and residents here are shipping out as Gaza braces for the force of an all-out assault. Like other communities along the 40-mile fence with Israel, the streets of Sderot now lie largely empty save for security forces, volunteers and the smattering of residents  who have decided to stay. Nine out of  10 people in the working-class southern city of 30,000 people have left.

In recent days, much of Sderot and its surroundings has been declared a closed security zone as the military prepares staging grounds on the border. New concrete road blocks have been installed to stop traffic as artillery blasts out shells into Gaza.

From an overlook in the city, beyond the supposedly impenetrable border fence that Hamas made light work of in  the Oct. 7 assault, the Gazan cities of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia stretch out below. Black plumes rise from the sky as shells from Israeli tanks hit their mark, with the sound of explosions occasionally punctuated by the rattle of machine gun fire.

An Arabic speaker after having grown up in Morocco before emigrating to Israel, she has fond memories of visiting Gaza to eat fish and attend weddings before the 40-mile-long separation fence was constructed to pen off the Gaza Strip.

But now she’d like to see it erased. “If I could, I’d go kill them all,” she said, letting out an “oy, oy, oy” at the boom of outgoing artillery at the end of a temporary humanitarian cease-fire.

She’s the first call of the day for Malka Stein, a nurse from Rescuers Without Borders, who had traveled from northern Israel to volunteer. But now she thinks she may be needed more at home, as the Israeli government moved to evacuate 28 communities close to the Lebanese border, amid fears of a broader conflagration with Hezbollah.

As a second group waited for a ride out, a rocket flashed across the sky and people rushed toward the school shelter, reminding some of their reasons for leaving. About 74 rockets have made direct hits on homes here over the past week.

But for some, the decision is harder than others. Yossi and Shmurit Edrich’s baby was born on Oct. 6, just hours before Hamas’s incursion into their town. Premature and weighing just over 4 pounds, the baby has to stay in the hospital for a week.

The city has emptied out before, but people are expecting a longer haul this time, said Ayelet Shmuel, director of the city’s resilience center. “The city knows how to run,” she said. “But this time we don’t know what’s going to happen.”

“Now we are going for our revenge,” said Capt. Nadav Mizrahi, a reserve officer deployed with a tank brigade. “To destroy everything from top to bottom,” he said. “I’m sure we can do it. It will take time and cost lives. But it’s our country. We will do anything.”

Headline: Strike on Gaza hospital kills hundreds, Palestinian officials say, as Biden departs for Israel visit

Description: The strike on the hospital came as President Biden was set to visit the region and humanitarian aid for Gaza remained stranded on the Egyptian border.

Content: Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.

The strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden’s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country’s worst crisis in decades.

Palestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza’s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.

Israel’s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.

“We all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,” Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. “They go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”

Biden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid.

Israel’s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.

“We all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,” Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. “They go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”

Biden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid.

Description: The strike on the hospital came as President Biden was set to visit the region and humanitarian aid for Gaza remained stranded on the Egyptian border.

Content: Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.

The strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden’s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country’s worst crisis in decades.

Palestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded.

In response to the Hamas attack, Israel has throttled Gaza, a 25-mile-long enclave under Hamas control that is home to 2 million people, sealing it off from aid deliveries and cutting off electricity amid blistering airstrikes and an expected ground incursion. The effect has been what a U. N. agency has called a “bone-chilling” humanitarian crisis that has turned the densely populated and besieged enclave into a “hellhole.”

Headline: The history of presidential visits to war zones, from Madison to Biden

Description: As President Biden visits Israel Wednesday, here’s a tour through the history of presidential visits to war zones—some of them covert, rash and even life-threatening.

Content: An earlier version of the above caption incorrectly said that President Abraham Lincoln was visiting Antietam, Md. He was at the Antietam battlefield in Maryland. The caption has been corrected. President Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday as the Israeli military ramps up its response to the Hamas attack. It will be Biden’s second visit as president to an active war zone not under U.S. military control; he visited Ukraine in February.As commander in chief of the U.S. military, presidents have always had a role to fill in wartime. And many, from the first president, have had military experience. But only a handful have made trips to active war zones while in office. Here are some historical highlights.

While Abraham Lincoln is sometimes described as the first president to come under enemy fire in an active war zone, it was actually James Madison during the War of 1812, according to Michael Beschloss, author of “Presidents of War.” On Aug. 24, 1814, Madison traveled from the White House to the Battle of Bladensburg a few miles east, brandishing two pistols and a spyglass. Though it is extremely unlikely the British knew Madison was there, he nonetheless came under enemy fire.

Once it was clear that the British were going to win the battle and invade the capital, Madison high-tailed it back through Washington and over the Potomac River to Virginia. The British set the Capitol and the White House on fire, but their sacking of the city was interrupted by a sudden hurricane-strength storm, prompting a hasty retreat. Madison returned to Washington a week later, on Sept. 1.

Lincoln made numerous battlefield visits during the Civil War, though the only time he ventured close enough to come under enemy fire was during his visit to Fort Stevens, on the northern side of the District of Columbia, on July 12, 1864. The tall, lanky, top-hatted president cut a recognizable profile from a distance, and Confederate soldiers soon began shooting at him, prompting a Union soldier to request that Lincoln kindly leave; he is often said, apocryphally, to have shouted, “Get down, you damn fool!”

Fort Stevens Park, where the fort once stood, is in D. C.’s Brightwood neighborhood, and there’s a small cemetery a few blocks away for Union soldiers killed in the Battle of Fort Stevens.

Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first president to fly on an airplane during his secret 1943 trip to North Africa as World War II raged. While the media thought he was vacationing at his home in New York’s Hudson Valley, Roosevelt traveled by train to Miami, where he took a plane to Trinidad and Tobago, then to Brazil and Gambia before finally landing in Casablanca, Morocco, five days later. There, he attended strategy meetings with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and French commander Charles de Gaulle, before surprising U. S. military members with a drive-by review. A United Press International correspondent later wrote that as the president’s Jeep slowly passed by, the surprise at his presence left soldiers’ “faces wreathed in smiles.”

In October 1966, as American support for the war in Vietnam began to wane, Lyndon B. Johnson made a surprise visit to U. S. forces at Cam Ranh Bay. Like Lincoln, Johnson was a tall guy and made himself a pretty easy target by getting close to the action, according to Beschloss, even standing up in a Jeep to address the troops. Unlike Lincoln, he did not come under fire. Johnson made a second visit to Cam Ranh Bay the next year.

Every president since Johnson has visited U. S. troops posted in conflict zones overseas. Richard M. Nixon also went to Vietnam; Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump all visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea; both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush served Thanksgiving turkeys to troops in Iraq during their presidencies; Bill Clinton visited Bosnia; and Barack Obama spent time with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Visits to U. S. troops overseas are nothing new for Biden, who went on such trips as vice president and as a senator on the Foreign Relations Committee.

What is new is that the U. S. military is not actively engaged in the conflict zones Biden is visiting this year. His February visit to Ukraine and now his visit to Israel are both without precedent in modern presidential history.

Headline: Family of hostage Mia Shem pleads for her release after Hamas video
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 08:26 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/17/mia-shem-hamas-hostage-video-mother/?itid=lk_inline_manual_50 
Description: The 21-year-old French-Israeli woman vanished Oct. 7 from a music festival attacked by militants. International leaders joined her family in urging for her to be let go.

Content: Keren Shem got her first glimpse of her missing child when everyone else did. She saw her daughter, Mia Shem, in a hostage video Monday — the first time Hamas had publicly released a clip of one of the roughly 200 hostages the militants are holding in the Gaza Strip. The mother screamed and fell to the floor when she saw Mia’s face on her TV. She started to sing and cry, telling herself her 21-year-old French Israeli daughter had survived after vanishing Oct. 7 from a music festival targeted by Hamas militants. Then she grew scared.

“I could see she was shot in the shoulder,” Keren Shem told reporters Tuesday at a news conference. It seemed as though her daughter was saying only what her kidnappers were telling her to say, she added. “I didn’t know if she was dead or alive until yesterday.”

The family and its spokespeople have transliterated their names as both Shem and Schem but used the former spelling on place cards at the news conference Tuesday.

The video, and the family’s confirmation of Mia’s identity, come as Israel prepares for a potentially deadly ground invasion of Gaza and President Biden prepares to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Hamas attacks have killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and injured more than 4,120, authorities said. Roughly 3,000 people in Gaza have been killed and more than 12,500 wounded, according to Palestinian officials.

A spokesman for the militant group said Tuesday that the hostages held by Hamas face the “same danger and conditions” as people living in Gaza. Hamas has also claimed that some of the hostages have been killed by Israeli strikes, a claim that could not be confirmed.

The United Nations has called for the release of all prisoners, saying that hostage-taking is prohibited under international law. A senior Hamas official suggested Tuesday the militant group would release its hostages at “the right time” after the war.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Shem was probably coerced to speak in the video. “It’s a propaganda video much more than it is proof of life,” Kirby said Tuesday on NBC News’s “Today.”

The Washington Post could not independently verify when the video was recorded or Shem’s current condition. But Keren Shem said she felt the video was a sign of optimism for her daughter, even as it’s clear that other hostages need medical care for potentially life-threatening injuries.

In the video, Mia Shem is shown receiving treatment for an arm injury. She then tells the camera in Hebrew she is in Gaza and underwent a medical procedure there for three hours. She pleads to be returned home.

According to her mother, Mia Shem was kidnapped at a music festival in southern Israel that turned into a deadly massacre in which hundreds were killed and many were captured. Mia had gone with a friend “to have some fun,” her mother said.

Keren Shem said she has barely slept since the day the festival was attacked. She said her daughter loves to cook and make her friends and family happy.

“In the video published by Hamas, they try to portray themselves as humane,” the IDF wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “However, they are a [horrific] terrorist organization responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, children, men, women and the elderly.”

When asked at the news conference whether she was worried Israel’s planned ground invasion could harm her daughter, Keren Shem said she was trying to focus on her daughter and called for all the hostages to be returned home and given medical care.

“I’m trying not to think about the invasion into Gaza,” she said. “All I’m asking from the leaders of the world is to return my baby home in the exact condition I saw her on TV.”

Headline: Why Egypt’s Rafah border crossing is vital for Gaza’s humanitarian crisis
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 08:41 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/17/rafah-crossing-egypt-gaza-war/ 
Description: The link between Egypt and Gaza is the only route for aid convoys to enter and foreign citizens to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave.

Content: It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.

The crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.

People and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.

Israel’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.

The latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.

As drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.

Egypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.

After President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.

The passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.

Those border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.

While U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.

Israel has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.

Description: The link between Egypt and Gaza is the only route for aid convoys to enter and foreign citizens to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave.

Content: It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.

The crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.

People and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.

Israel’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.

The latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.

As drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.

Egypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.

After President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.

The passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.

Those border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.

While U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.

Israel has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.

Headline: White House weighs $100 billion for Israel, Ukraine bill; plans in flux

Description: Budget officials plan a major request to Congress as U.S. faces foreign policy crises on multiple fronts

Content: White House officials are considering asking Congress for an aid package primarily aimed at supporting Ukraine and Israel that could cost as much as $100 billion, although that preliminary estimate may change as planning remains in flux, according to four people briefed on the matter. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.In conversations with congressional staffers, Biden aides have discussed proposing as soon as this week a major foreign policy package amid numerous international crises, including the war between Hamas and Israel. The legislation is also expected to include substantial funds to bolster U.S. immigration enforcement at the southern border with Mexico, and may include funds for Taiwan to deter aggression from China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations. Money to respond to recent U.S. natural disasters, including wildfires in Maui and various hurricanes, could also be folded into the legislation.

Aides stressed that the plans were highly uncertain and subject to change. President Biden previously proposed roughly $20.4 billion in funding for Ukraine, but Congress blocked any additional money for Ukraine when it extended government funding into November.

“It’s going to make a strong statement to our enemies and to our friends,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said about the proposed aid package.

One person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said the request would cover a full fiscal year for the crises it is intended to address.

Democratic leaders said they expect to receive the proposal at the end of this week.

“We intend to get the package at the end of this week and it will include the military help Israel needs, the diplomatic and intelligence help Israel needs, as well as humanitarian aid to minimize the loss of innocent human life, of Palestinians and of Israelis,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) told reporters.

The effort comes as House Republicans struggle to elect a new speaker, which could complicate efforts to pass any bill swiftly. House Republicans have grown increasingly wary of providing taxpayer funds to Kyiv, but may be more likely to do so if a request also includes money for the border and Israel.

Bloomberg reported earlier that White House officials were considering a $100 billion request in the aid package. It was unclear how much money would be included for each country.

Headline: How Hannity, Bannon and others on the right helped fuel GOP speaker chaos
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 10:08 PM
URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/17/sean-hannity-jim-jordan-speaker/?itid=lk_inline_manual_93 
Description: From Steve Bannon to Sean Hannity, right-wing media stars have had enormous influence over Republicans’ search for a leader.

Content: But the widely watched conservative pundit wasn’t only using his televised bully pulpit to pressure the holdouts. Hannity also spent the weekend personally calling several and having one of his producers reach out to others to lobby them on their vote. He also took to social media to encourage his followers to call wavering members and demand they fall into line.

As of Tuesday afternoon, when Jordan lost an initial vote of the full House, it was unclear whether the turbulent series of events would end with a congressman long relegated to the hard-right fringe elevated to lead the chamber. But the overall picture of the legislative branch in chaos — and the allure of the media spotlight helping to drive the dysfunction — was well-established.

Then House Republicans’ original preferred replacement — Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) — had to withdraw from contention after failing to consolidate the support of hard-right members and the media figures who back them. Now Hannity and others are leaning on Jordan’s critics to get behind the Ohio congressman, who has long been a favorite of Fox News and other conservative outlets.

The campaign by Hannity to boost Jordan, who has also been endorsed for the speaker’s job by former president Donald Trump, began soon after Scalise withdrew from the race. On Friday afternoon, Hannity tweeted that “Any Member of Congress would be crazy to NOT support Jim Jordan for Speaker. He is a natural born principled leader who will lead house Republicans to unite vs the radical left.” Hannity went on to provide the switchboard number for the House of Representatives, and urged his followers to “call your member and tell them.”

Over the weekend, Hannity reached out to several holdout lawmakers who were not supporting Jordan, while one of his producers contacted lawmakers with an email asking why they weren’t backing him. The producer’s email, which was first reported by Axios and has been confirmed by The Washington Post, included a leading question: “Hannity would like to know why during a war breaking out between Israel and Hamas, with a war in Ukraine, with the wide open borders, with a budget that’s unfinished why would Rep xxx be against Rep Jim Jordan for speaker?”

But in a measure of the limits of those kinds of pressure tactics, Womack on Tuesday was among the 20 Republicans who declined to support Jordan in the floor vote. Womack, who voted for Scalise instead, said the GOP’s initial nominee had been “kneecapped” before he could get his own vote before the full House.

Some members have been unusually outspoken in blasting their colleagues for playing to the cameras. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) tweeted last week that his fellow members were making decisions based on “egos and TV time.” McCarthy, meanwhile, was unequivocal in identifying what he saw as the reasons Gaetz had moved against him. “It had nothing to do about spending,” he told reporters shortly after his ouster. “It all was about getting attention from you.”

In the case of the speaker fight, the consequence has been a string of firsts that hint at the underlying chaos: the first 15-round speaker election in nearly two centuries when McCarthy was chosen in January; the first ouster of a speaker by a vote of the House when he was deposed this month; and the first vacancy in over half a century to last two weeks or more.

Previous Republican speakers have had tortured tenures as they have attempted to govern in the face of factions trying to wield outsize power by leveraging their influence on the airwaves. For instance, unlike McCarthy, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) wasn’t voted out of office. But he did step aside under pressure in 2015 after the Freedom Caucus, led in part by Jordan and backed by Fox, made the Republican conference ungovernable.

But once in power, McCarthy had to make deals with Democrats to keep the government functioning. The cycle eventually caught up with him, as it is likely to do with anyone in his position, even a Fox News regular like Jordan, Stirewalt said.

“Jim Jordan used Fox News and the right-of-center media to great effect over the past decade to force his way into the conference, to force his way into leadership and create all these pressure points,” Stirewalt said. “So after this long struggle, you hear people saying, ‘We have to stop here. The revolution has to stop here.’ But I don’t see why anyone feels like they have to go along now and behave themselves.”

Headline: Fearing blame for Gaza conflict, anxiety grows among U.S. Palestinians
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 10:25 PM

Description: Tensions over bloodshed in the Middle East have Palestinian Americans increasingly anxious about the violence they may face here.

Content: The Palestinian boy who had been knifed to death on Saturday was 6 — the same age as her son — so Fidaa Elaydi imposed a new rule: No more playing outside. She used to feel safe in Bridgeview, a Chicago suburb full of Middle Eastern eateries and Muslim clothing boutiques that was known as Little Palestine. Then the Palestinian militant group Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

In the 10 days since the rampage by Hamas fighters and Israel’s full-scale counterstrike targeting the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, a spate of headlines has validated her fears. In Boston, somebody spray-painted “Nazis” on a sign for a Palestinian cultural center. In Dearborn, Mich., police arrested a man who allegedly urged his Facebook friends to “hunt Palestinians.” And barely 25 miles from Elaydi’s house, a landlord is accused of stabbing his tenants, gravely wounding the mother and killing her son, with authorities linking his assault “to them being Muslims and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.”

Palestinians in the United States, half a world away from the carnage in the Middle East, say they are canceling dinners out, taking time off work and staying home. Some are getting ominous emails and messages on social media. Others say the environment seems so charged, they’re afraid to openly express concern for loved ones trapped in Gaza as Israel pushes to eradicate the militants responsible for the Oct. 7 massacre of soldiers and civilians.

Anguish for family members in Gaza only heightened the anxiety after a strike Tuesday set a hospital ablaze. Palestinian and Israeli officials traded blame for the attack. The only certainty: Hundreds may have been killed, adding to the death toll of about 3,000 Palestinians.

Those who argue for a Palestinian state, a decades-old cause, say they are being framed as cheerleading “Hamas’s genocidal war,” as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) phrased it in a letter to the Justice Department. Hawley called for an investigation of student groups organizing pro-Palestinian rallies.

The bloodshed overseas is sowing panic in communities across the country, with the FBI saying it is tracking a spike in threats against both Muslim and Jewish Americans. The agency warned that bad actors could “exploit the conflict” and provoke violence “on our own soil.” Mosques and synagogues have beefed up security. Some private Jewish day schools shuttered last week after a former Hamas leader called for a “day of jihad.”

Hundreds of Arab Americans gathered at a mosque in Bridgeview on Monday for the funeral of the 6-year-old boy, Wadea Alfayoumi, who had been stabbed 26 times, the sheriff’s office said. Outside, speakers called on lawmakers to address the conflict with context and nuance. Some demanded an apology from President Biden, whom they accused of inflaming tensions with his comment about seeing photos of Hamas fighters beheading children — a claim the White House later walked back.

One attended a pro-Palestinian rally on campus last week where strangers started filming the students, Othman said, and she advised her to not engage with anyone who seemed hostile. She doesn’t want her daughters to limit their freedom of speech, though.

Randa Mohammad, a student-support coordinator at a middle school in Dearborn, is following the news with a growing sense of dread. Five of her relatives — her sister-in-law’s cousins — were killed in Gaza while trying to help civilians who had been ordered to evacuate, she said. When videos of the hospital attack reached her phone, she hid in the garage so her children wouldn’t see her cry.

More than half of Dearborn’s residents are Arab American. Familial ties to Gaza and the West Bank run deep. People love to snack on flaky, cheese-layered kunafa at the beloved Palestinian bakery. And, Mohammad said, everyone is on edge.

The police presence outside her school has been heavier than normal, she noted; officers arrested a 41-year-old man last week who had posted on social media about hunting Palestinians. On Monday, a 12-year-old student came to her with a question.

The Arab American Political Action Committee canceled a banquet scheduled for Wednesday in Dearborn, accusing American leaders of endorsing bloodshed by not “doing the bare minimum of calling for a cease fire.” The organizers also harbored security concerns, according to Osama Siblani, a Lebanese journalist on the board of directors. Palestinians as a group, he said, are too often portrayed as the enemy.

Headline: Gaza hospital where hundreds were killed is owned by Anglican Communion branch
Publish Date: Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 10:29 PM

Description: The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was also struck Saturday and had braced to be a key support in the war.

Content: The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City — where authorities suspect an airstrike killed hundreds of people Tuesday — is owned and operated by a branch of the Anglican Communion, one of the largest Christian groups in the world. The 80-bed hospital normally sees about 3,500 outpatient visits a month, according to the website of the Diocese of Jerusalem, the local branch of the Anglican Communion that runs al-Ahli. It handles about 300 surgeries and roughly 600 radiological visits a month.

Eileen Spencer, head of the American fundraising arm for the diocese, told The Washington Post that after the strike Tuesday, “we don’t know if the hospital will still be standing.”

Al-Ahli is Gaza’s only independent, Christian-led medical facility, Spencer said. “I don’t understand what the point of all this is. There are so many casualties, and it seems like it is just going to get worse.”

Tuesday had been a day of fasting and prayer for peace in the Holy Land, called for by Pope Francis, the Anglican Communion and other Christian denominations. After the hospital strike, the Diocese of Jerusalem called for a day of mourning Wednesday.

In a written statement, the diocese said, “The devastation witnessed, coupled with the sacrilegious targeting of the church, strikes at the very core of human decency. We assert unequivocally that this is deserving international condemnation and retribution. An urgent appeal resonates for the international community to fulfil its duty in protecting civilians and ensuring that such inhumane horrific acts are not replicated.”

The hospital was founded in 1882, according to the Jerusalem diocese’s website. It runs a free program for breast cancer detection and provides free medical care and food to people in nearby towns and villages.

On Oct. 8, in the hours after the Hamas attack on Israel, the hospital launched a fundraising appeal, saying it was urgent to get medicine and other supplies for emergencies that the staff predicted would come.

“The situation is severely critical, and the consequences for people in Gaza are very bad, particularly in the health sector. The Ministry of Health has triggered an emergency situation and asked all health-service providers to increase their emergency response capacity. Life in Gaza is paralyzed, with all institutions and private sectors closed, affecting the people’s access to basic needs, particularly health,” hospital director Suhaila Tarazi wrote in the appeal. “AAH is committed to continuing to provide 24/7 health services for all people in need of medical care.”

An Israeli rocket hit al-Ahli on Saturday, according to the Anglican Communion’s news service. It landed on the cancer treatment center, severely damaging two floors where the ultrasound and mammography wards are. Four hospital staff were injured.

“The Diagnostic Centre is the Crown Jewel of Ahli Hospital, providing cancer diagnosis as a prelude to various treatment options both at Ahli and in other facilities,” the Anglican archbishop of Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum, said in a story about the Saturday strike. The hospital was due to open a new chemotherapy center there next month, Naoum said.

Hundreds are believed dead after what Palestinian officials say was an Israeli airstrike Tuesday on the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter. The Israel Defense Forces blamed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying “a barrage of rockets” was passing near the hospital when it was hit.

Violence and protests broke out in many Arab cities following the hospital strike, and within hours, Jordan’s foreign minister said his country would not host a summit that had been planned for Wednesday with President Biden, Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

“We grieve at the continuing loss of innocent lives. The latest news from Gaza is distressing and comes on top of what has been an appalling 10 days for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” Gavin Drake wrote to The Post. “At the moment, we are monitoring the situation closely and continuing to gather information in this fast moving situation.”

Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, leader of the Episcopal Church, which is the U. S. branch of the Anglican Communion, said in a statement Tuesday that he had visited the hospital in 2018 and saw how “they were passionately committed to anyone who had need.”

“I ask you to pray fervently for the birthplace of the Abrahamic faiths and for all its people. Pray for those who have been hurt, harmed, or killed — regardless of who they are or who did it,” he continued. “Pray also for the leaders and people of the entire region, that they will find the way to a just peace where all may live in safety and security as God intends.”

Headline: Biden faces physical risks in flying to war-torn Middle East

Description: The U.S. president heads into an area subject to rocket and bomb attacks, though experts say he will be heavily protected.

Content: Adding to the risks of Biden’s trip was a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that killed at least 500 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter, while the Israel Defense Forces blamed an errant rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying “a barrage of rockets” was passing near the hospital when it was hit.

The hospital blast has set off fierce protests in the Middle East, including in Jordan, where the Israeli Embassy was surrounded by protesters Tuesday evening. A planned visit by Biden to Amman on Wednesday was canceled after the strike, forcing the U. S. president to forgo a scheduled meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

Some security experts said the physical risk to Biden would be relatively small despite the chaos in the region. Biden is one of the most protected people on the planet, they said, and Air Force One is equipped with sophisticated air defense systems that can thwart incoming rockets and missiles.

Still, it’s a rarity for a president to travel directly into a region where hostilities are intensifying, with an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza expected within days and fears that the militant group Hezbollah might enter the fray. Biden faces at least some risk when he is on the ground in Tel Aviv, a city Hamas rockets are able to reach. In Amman, which Biden had planned to visit after his stop in Tel Aviv, the situation remains combustible.

“Being in an active area of hostilities, they have to look very carefully at the threats that Israel is facing now, understanding that the president will be on the ground,” said Jonathan Lord, senior fellow and director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security. “So they’re definitely thinking about Israel’s air defense capabilities and protecting the president from Hamas rockets.”

The crisis erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants broke through Israel’s sophisticated border fence with Gaza and hunted Israeli civilians in their cars and homes, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages into Gaza, including some Americans. Tensions have only grown since then as the brutality and scope of Hamas’s attacks have become clearer and as Israel has launched repeated deadly airstrikes in Gaza.

Biden’s visit comes as Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion that it says is an effort to destroy Hamas, potentially setting off one of the worst conflicts in the region in decades. U. S. officials are deeply concerned that the war could spread and draw in such actors as Hezbollah or Iran.

Biden has stressed his ironclad support for Israel since the Hamas attacks, but in recent days, he has sought to strike a more delicate balance between support for Israel’s right to self-defense and concern about civilians in Gaza, where conditions have rapidly deteriorated.

Gaza is a densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. Even without a formal occupation, Israel controls almost all aspects of life in the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, water, electricity and fuel — tactics that human rights groups have said violate international law.

The country has also unleashed an unrelenting bombardment campaign and warned more than 1 million Palestinians to flee northern Gaza to avoid being in harm’s way, an order that the United Nations called impossible. Biden and his top aides have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors so that Palestinian civilians can flee and aid can get into the Palestinian territory.

Experts said Biden’s trip to Kyiv this year was in some ways more dangerous than the Israel trip because Russia has a far more sophisticated military than Hamas. Although Hamas is arguably a far more unpredictable entity, its militants are unlikely to have the technology or prowess to launch a targeted attack against an American president.

“The risk to the president himself is probably pretty minimal. He is surrounded by Secret Service and the Israelis will provide additional protection layers,” Riedel said. He added that Biden flying in and out of the Middle East in one day, rather than staying in an easily identifiable location overnight, further minimizes the risks.

“I think we have seen a significant shift in the administration’s position,” Riedel said. “On October 7th, it was, ‘We’re 100 percent behind Israel. We have Israel’s back.’ We’re still behind Israel, we still have Israel’s back — but we’re also eager to avoid significant civilian casualties in Gaza and we do not want the conflict to spread to other areas.”

Headline: Ahead of Biden visit, Israel’s treatment of civilians looms large

Description: Israel’s treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza poses a growing dilemma for the Biden administration.

Content: Palestinian authorities said at least 500 people were killed in a strike on a crowded hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, adding a dramatic escalation to a death toll that already stood above 2,000 since Israeli forces began pounding the densely populated area with airstrikes following Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault. As many as 1 million people were ordered to flee south as bombardment reduces much of northern Gaza to rubble and conditions deteriorate following Israel’s suspension of water and electricity to the Hamas-ruled enclave, posing an additional test for Biden as he flies to the Middle East.

Biden, in a statement issued as he travels to Israel, said he was “outraged” by the hospital explosion. The United States, he said, “stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict.” In turn, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas canceled his planned meeting with Biden, and a summit that was to include Biden and the leaders of Egypt and Jordan also was called off.

Biden himself, a longtime supporter of Israel who has issued an emotional condemnation of Hamas’s “act of sheer evil,” has pledged unqualified support for Israel’s goal of obliterating the group. But the president and his aides, facing pressure from within the Democratic Party to curb the violence, also are warning Israel against reoccupying Gaza and saying they expect Israel to adhere to the laws of war.

“You have an administration that has made very public commitments to improve how it addresses civilian harm, including with partners,” said Annie Shiel, U. S. advocacy director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “And if the U.S. isn’t going to be firm with Israel about civilian harm and its obligations, then those commitments seem like they go out the window.”

Legal experts said that expanding U. S. military support for Israel meanwhile carries with it weighty considerations for the United States as reported Palestinian casualties mount. Already the administration has positioned two aircraft carriers in the eastern Mediterranean, dispatched an amphibious task force to the area, and expedited shipments of munitions and air defense missiles. How Israel employs U.S.-origin weapons, experts said, may now have new implications for the United States.

Brian Finucane, who served as a State Department attorney during the Obama administration, said the considerations include domestic laws governing arms sales specifying that U. S. weapons can be sold to other countries for the goal of “legitimate self-defense” and international laws that could, in theory, implicate a donor of military aid to a nation that then goes on to violate the laws of war with those arms.

Despite a bargaining session between Blinken and Israel’s war cabinet that went for more than seven hours from Monday evening into the early hours of Tuesday morning, the two sides were only able to agree “to develop a plan” that will include the “possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm’s way,” Blinken said after emerging from the meeting.

Description: During a contentious confirmation hearing, Jack Lew sought to fend off GOP attacks on his past defense of the Iran nuclear deal and related policies.

Content: At times contentious, Lew’s hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee coincided with a dramatic appearance in Israel by Biden as furor grips the Middle East and protests over the mounting death toll among Palestinians, who have faced days of Israeli bombardment, spread across the region. The proceedings in Washington centered on what lawmakers overwhelmingly agreed is Israel’s need for a steadfast American ally in the wake of this month’s devastating Hamas attack, though many Republicans signaled it would be difficult for them to support Lew given his past work to implement the now-defunct deal with Israel’s sworn enemy.

Other Republicans on the committee, including Sens. Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) and Mitt Romney (Utah) suggested that the relaxation of sanctions under the nuclear deal allowed Tehran to more seriously fund militant groups such as Hamas. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) accused Lew of misleading the committee in his past testimony and alleged that the Obama administration sought to provide Iran access to U. S. banks.

“We negotiated with Iran to have them roll back their nuclear program, in exchange for which they would get access to money that was their money that we had frozen. All we did was facilitate that transaction,” he said. “My team went around the world, telling banks: ‘... We did not lift the sanctions on terrorism. We did not lift the sanctions on human rights violations. We did not lift the sanctions on regional destabilization. Be careful.’ And Iran thought that kept them from getting what they thought they should get.”

The landmark nuclear deal restricted Iran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the loosening of U. S. sanctions. Obama argued then that the agreement was intended to set back any effort by Tehran to build nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement after taking office, and Iran has since exceeded the deal’s limits on the quantity and quality of its enriched uranium production.

At the time of the 2015 negotiations, Lew defended the deal publicly to pro-Israel audiences in the United States, where he was once heckled. And because the Treasury Department is charged with implementing sanctions policies, he presided over the loosening of restrictions on Iran. The deal unlocked foreign investment in Iran and eased financing for the government. Backers encouraged that investment as part of ensuring that the agreement functioned as it was envisioned.

“I think it’s important to distinguish between the technical details to facilitate implementation of the [Iran nuclear agreement] and more broadly welcoming Iran into the U. S. financial community. We didn’t. And I took no actions that would do that,” Lew said in response to Rubio’s assertions. The senator’s account, he added, was at odds with “my memory of what I had people out there doing.”

Lew, 68, who even before his term as treasury secretary served in the top echelon of the Obama and Clinton presidencies, is an unusually senior appointment for the role. He was Obama’s chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role he also filled for President Bill Clinton, when the federal government last ran a budget surplus. Under Obama, he was also a deputy secretary of state.

While several Democrats raised concerns during the hearing about the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where a humanitarian crisis is rapidly unfolding as Israeli forces wage a ferocious response to the Hamas attack, Republicans asked whether Lew was sufficiently supportive of Israel and if he shared their desire for a more hawkish approach to Middle East peace.

“This is not the time for us to be lecturing Israel on what they have to do to establish the security that they have a responsibility to provide,” Lew said. “I think they know they have to do it in a way that is consistent with minimizing the impact on innocent civilians,” he added. But previous U. S. wars have demonstrated that “it is very, very hard for there not to be collateral damage.”

“We’re all aware that Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who went on to ask, “Will you, if you are confirmed, work with Israel to make sure that schools and hospitals and power and water systems are not targeted?”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), broached the spread of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying the seizure of “more and more Palestinian lands” was potentially undermining efforts to broker peace and, in turn, strengthening Hamas. He asked Lew whether the Biden administration’s pursuit of a deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia would need some “attention paid to the Palestinian issues” if it is to succeed.

Now is “probably not the right time” to address whether Palestinian grievances should be a part of any deal between the Israelis and Saudis, Lew responded. “But after this war is over, it has to be part of the conversation.”

Description: For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state.

Content: These and other incidents have rattled Jewish communities on campuses across America as they mourn victims of the Oct. 7 massacres and kidnappings. For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state. But the outbreak of war has elevated those tensions even further in recent days and raised new alarms about intimidation and antisemitism on campus.

Colleges and universities usually take pride in hosting demonstrations and debate, as long as no one gets hurt. Fiery rhetoric is tolerated and often encouraged as students and faculty members engage on politics, the climate, the economy, racism and war. But Jewish leaders say that too often debates over the Middle East take a problematic turn, leading to a threatening atmosphere for Jewish students. For them, that phenomenon is not new.

“The campus climate for Jewish students has been degrading over several years, and that has been aggravated by broader increases in antisemitism and virulent demonization of Israel on campuses,” Adam Lehman, president and chief executive of the Jewish organization Hillel International, said in an interview. Lehman said the climate in recent days has worsened.

After the surprise Hamas attack that left more than 1,400 people dead in Israel and thousands more wounded, the Georgia Tech chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi hung a banner from a balcony that declared solidarity with Israel. On Saturday, its members found the pro-Palestinian message written in shaving cream underneath the banner. The message was washed off, but it left a deeper impression: Their home, the fraternity members felt, had been violated.

“We are deeply saddened by the defacing of our property that was committed last weekend,” the chapter said in a statement. “As a Jewish fraternity, we have all been deeply affected by the current events in Israel, and we are profoundly disheartened to see that this conflict has allowed antisemitism to gain a foothold on our campus. With our fellow Jews under attack in Israel, we feel that it is important to visibly display our support for the Israeli people as Jewish leaders at Georgia Tech.”

At Stanford, the Jewish news organization the Forward reported last week, an instructor had asked Jewish and Israeli students in a class to identify themselves, take their belongings and stand in a corner. The apparent point of the exercise, according to the article, was to show students how the instructor believed Israel treats the Palestinians.

University leaders acknowledged in an Oct. 11 statement that they had received a report of a class in which an instructor “addressed the Middle East conflict in a manner that called out individual students in class based on their backgrounds and identities.” Stanford President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez said the instructor, who was not identified, “is not currently teaching” while the university in California investigates. “Without prejudging the matter, this report is a cause for serious concern,” they wrote.

At Tufts University in Massachusetts, Micah Gritz, 21, a senior from Rockville, Md., who is a leader in a group called Jewish on Campus, said he was horrified to read an email in which a campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine used paraglider emojis to advertise a rally in nearby Cambridge. The email also praised “liberation fighters” — an allusion to Hamas militants — who had used paragliders in the cross-border attack and showed “creativity necessary to take back stolen land.”

Cornell was roiled after an associate professor of history, Russell Rickford, spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in Ithaca, N. Y. The Cornell Daily Sun, a student newspaper, and others published video of his remarks. In the speech, Rickford cited “many Gazans of goodwill, many Palestinians of conscience, who abhor violence — as do you, as do I.” But he also said many who support the Palestinian cause had strong feelings after learning of the Oct. 7 attack.

“It was exhilarating,” he said. “It was energizing. And if they weren’t exhilarated by this challenge to the monopoly of violence, by this shifting of the balance of power, then they would not be human. I was exhilarated.”

But he told the Cornell Daily Sun that he believed the Hamas attack signaled that “the Palestinian will to resist had not been broken.” He acknowledged that in subsequent days, “we learned of some of the horrifying realities.”

Martha E. Pollack, Cornell’s president, and Kraig H. Kayser, chairman of the university’s board of trustees, rebuked Rickford in a statement Tuesday and said the university was reviewing the matter. Faculty members at universities, especially those with tenure protections, are often given significant leeway in matters of free speech and academic freedom.

Headline: At Gaza hospital, a hoped-for haven now scene of mourning and questions

Description: Families had camped near the hospital seeking safety from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip. Israel has said a misfired Palestinian rocket was behind the blast.

Content: Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday’s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.

Palestinian teams combed Wednesday through the blast zone — an area that radiated from a crater punched into pavement just outside the four-story complex. Cars were flipped over by the force of the explosion. Other vehicles were charred. The blast bent metal fencing and shattered windows.

Gaza’s Health Ministry said 471 people were killed and more than 300 were injured, with 28 of the injured in critical condition. The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.

“Because of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,” said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.

It’s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel’s military said that part of a “barrage of rockets” fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden’s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.

“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.

Hundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.

Video verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion — a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.

Hospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.

More than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.

Israel launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died — many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion — and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.

Regional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan’s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war “has entered a dangerous phase,” and “will plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,” according to a palace statement.

Biden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack.

The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.

“Because of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,” said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.

It’s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel’s military said that part of a “barrage of rockets” fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden’s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.

“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.

Hundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.

Video verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion — a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.

Hospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.

More than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.

Israel launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died — many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion — and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.

Regional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan’s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war “has entered a dangerous phase,” and “will plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,” according to a palace statement.

Biden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack.

Description: Families had camped near the hospital seeking safety from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip. Israel has said a misfired Palestinian rocket was behind the blast.

Content: Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday’s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.

Headline: Fury after Gaza hospital blast surges across Middle East

Description: Protesters from Morocco to Iran condemned Israel and the United States for a deadly hospital attack — dismissing Israeli statements blaming Palestinian militants.

Content: BEIRUT — Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.

In the region, little attention was paid to Israel’s denial of responsibility, or Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.

The protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.

But in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.

Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.

People took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.

“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”

The swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.

But in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.

By Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.

Anger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.

In one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”

An accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

While many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.

The protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.

But in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.

Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.

People took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.

“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”

The swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.

But in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.

By Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.

Anger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.

In one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”

An accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

While many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.

Headline: Biden, in Tel Aviv, backs Israel’s claim of innocence on hospital blast

Description: President Biden’s trip is a dramatic display of support for Israel as fighting continues to rage.

Content: “The United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during the conflict. And I grieve. I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy,” Biden said. Earlier in the day, the president said his assessment of responsibility was based on data shown to him by the U. S. Defense Department.

Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the U. S. government assessment was based on “available reporting, including intelligence, missile activity, overhead imagery, and open source video and images of the incident.” The intelligence, she said, indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion was caused by a rocket or missile launched by a militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. She said U.S. officials are working to corroborate whether that is the case.

Since the hospital was devastated Tuesday by a strike that Palestinian authorities said killed hundreds of people, Israel and the United States have been the targets of rage, condemnation and protest that have surged across the Middle East. Wednesday’s statements by Israel and the United States that a Palestinian militant group was responsible for the blast may carry little weight with Arab protesters.

Among the most useful pieces of information in identifying who may be responsible for a strike are infrared signatures from satellites, which may have detected a rocket launch as opposed to an aerial bombing, one U. S. official said. Images of the impact site, as well as any fragments recovered, could also help identify who was responsible, the official said.

The U. S. conclusion appeared to do little to assuage anger in Arab and Muslim countries, where people generally harbor deep distrust of Israel and the United States. Israel’s army in the past has blamed Palestinian militants for strikes and civilian deaths and then later acknowledged it was probably at fault, such as in the death of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.

In Amman, Jordan, Biden had been scheduled to meet with the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to discuss the conflict and the need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. The White House said Biden would continue to be in touch with those leaders, but the meeting’s cancellation was a setback to the president’s diplomatic efforts.

“For the people of Israel, there’s only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel, and that is having you standing in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war, and it is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel.”

Description: Mounting Middle Eastern anger overshadowed President Biden’s visit to Israel, at least temporarily disrupting U.S. efforts to de-escalate regional tensions.

Content: Biden announced that a deal had been struck with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to flow from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million people face relentless airstrikes and an Israeli siege. Supplies of food, drinking water and fuel are dwindling by the hour. Despite the apparent breakthrough, Biden said the aid would not start arriving until Friday at the earliest.

Concerned that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a broader regional conflict, the White House has tried to assure Arab partners that it will use its influence to protect innocent Gazans. Conditions in the enclave — already one of the poorest and most densely populated places in the world — are deteriorating rapidly. More than 3,000 people have been killed by airstrikes. Local hospitals are collapsing.

Biden spent a little over seven hours in Israel, where he was greeted on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two men — whose decades-long relationship has been tested this year — shared a brief hug. Biden spent more than two hours at a meeting of the Israeli war cabinet before speaking with survivors of the attacks and families of victims and hostages.

Netanyahu emphasized Wednesday that Israel would not permit the transfer of any humanitarian aid to Gaza from its own territory, but said it would not thwart the delivery of supplies from Egypt, provided it was limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” — and so long as none of it reached Hamas.

The Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday called on residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the town of al-Mawasi, the latest in a series of recent directives urging Gazans to move south, even though most have nowhere to stay. The United Nations has warned that the evacuation orders may violate international law.

There was little acknowledgment in the region of Israel’s denial of responsibility for the hospital strike, or of Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalizing ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”

Description: The split screen unfolding after the al-Ahli Hospital blast is a setback for President Biden’s efforts to coordinate with Arab and Israeli allies on the Israel-Gaza war.

Content: But any sense of public comity between Washington and its Arab partners was shattered Tuesday as gruesome images emerged at the site of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian authorities say an Israeli airstrike killed up to 500 people in the attack. Israel denies the charge, saying the facility was blown up by errant rocket fire from an Islamist militant group. The White House, citing preliminary U. S. intelligence, has sided with Israel.

The hospital blast has “derailed a much-needed opportunity to make meaningful progress on the near-term solution to the Gaza crisis,” said Suzanne Maloney, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. “And by inflaming opinion across the Arab world, it has heightened prospects for escalation and a much more dangerous and protracted conflict in the region.”

When asked what made him think that, Biden cited the “data I was shown by my Defense Department,” without elaborating. The National Security Council later issued a statement attributing the U. S. intelligence assessment to “overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information,” though so far it has not publicly disclosed any of those materials.

The United States switched, for instance, its policy seeking safe passage for Palestinian civilians through Egypt in response to meetings with Abbas and Sisi, who opposed the proposal out of fear that fleeing Palestinians may never be able to return to Gaza.

That led up to what Biden announced on Wednesday: an agreement with Israel to allow the delivery of aid on the condition that there will be inspections and that the aid won’t go to Hamas. “Israel agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move,” Biden said.

But a critical player on aid delivery is Egypt, which controls part of the Rafah border crossing, and Hamas, which controls the other half. That is why Arab leaders, who have communication links with Hamas and other key players on the ground, were viewed as a critical part of Biden’s trip.

Description: Scenes of carnage from Gaza have deepened resentment of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and increased local support for Hamas, its longtime rival.

Content: Over the same period, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 60 Palestinians in the West Bank and injured more than 1,300, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has also locked down parts of the West Bank, closing roads and putting up checkpoints to prevent Palestinians from moving between towns and cities.

Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in 1967. Under the Oslo accords, brokered by President Bill Clinton in 1993, those territories were meant to form a Palestinian state. But the U. S.-led peace process has been dormant for years. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded. Members of Israel’s current government, the most far-right in its history, have called openly for annexation.

Since 2007, when Hamas violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip, Abbas has cracked down on supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza, as well as on his own critics. Long-promised elections have never been held. Despair has deepened in the impoverished refugee camps that still dot the West Bank.

Over the past two years, camps in Nablus, Jenin and elsewhere have become incubators for a new generation of armed groups that have carried out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians. Israel has responded with massive military raids across the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians here since the end of the second intifada in 2005.

“The worst is yet to come,” said the 38-year-old militant, a father of three, speaking on the condition that he be identified by his childhood nickname to protect his security. Zoufi said he awoke on Oct. 7 to the news of Hamas’s rampage and asked his wife to slap him to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. Then he laughed with joy.

Zoufi is affiliated with Fatah but opposes the Palestinian Authority’s nonviolent approach. He founded his militant cell last year. Balata is home to some 30,000 people and has no proper police force. The same is true in other camps in Nablus and Jenin and throughout the northern West Bank. In these communities, the militants are the ones in charge.

“If Israel will do a stupid thing like the ground invasion, war will break out not only in the West Bank and inside Israel but also around the Arab world,” he said. “We want liberation, not bloodshed. ... I hope it will stop before it comes to that.”

Mohamed Hamdan, the secretary general of Fatah in Nablus, defended Abbas and his efforts to revive peace negotiations. He said the authority was doing its best to maintain order and rein in weapons on the street. But the international community had “betrayed” the Palestinians, he said.

Headline: State Dept. official resigns, citing objection to Israel arms transfers

Description: Josh Paul’s departure from the State Department is a rare measure of internal dissent over the Biden administration’s robust support for Israel.

Content: A State Department official who worked on arms transfers to foreign powers resigned Wednesday over the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, declaring he could not support further U. S. military assistance to Israel and calling the administration’s response “an impulsive reaction” based on “intellectual bankruptcy.”Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.The official, Josh Paul, was director of congressional and public affairs at the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which handles arms transfers. His departure marks a rare measure of internal discomfort over the administration’s robust support for Israel, the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East. More broadly, it was an unusual public show of dissent within President Biden’s foreign policy apparatus, which has worked to prevent such expressions of frustration from spilling over into view.

Paul had spent more than 11 years in his role, which coordinates relations with Congress and public messaging for a key office that deals with military aid. He said that he could not countenance continuing in a job that he said was contributing to the deaths of Palestinian civilians.

“Let’s absolutely note the horror of what Hamas did, and the scale of it. And therefore I fear the scale of the potential Israeli response or ongoing Israeli response,” Paul said in an interview. “I recognize the Israeli government’s right to respond and to defend themselves. I guess I question how many Palestinian children have to die in that process.”

Paul said the robust U. S. military assistance for Israel was effectively giving the country a green light to do what it wants against Gaza, regardless of the civilian toll. The Israeli government has declared that it plans to destroy Hamas and has told the residents of Gaza City and northern Gaza to move southward, a request U.N. observers have declared will create a humanitarian disaster.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spent the past week hopscotching the Middle East in a bid to create regional support for Israel’s right to defend itself and avoid a regional war, but also to push Israel to respect humanitarian concerns in Gaza.

Biden, visiting Israel on Wednesday, declared that the United States is “going to stand with you.” But he urged Israelis to draw a distinction between Palestinians and Hamas, and to minimize civilian casualties.

Paul said that he had encountered other dilemmas while working on military assistance inside the State Department, but that he had always felt he could “bend things in the right direction.” Not so this time, which was the biggest reason he resigned, he said.

“There’s no questioning on this one. There’s no space for substantive dissent within the system on this one. And that’s what led me to my decision,” he said. He said there wasn’t a single precipitating moment that led to his resignation Wednesday, simply the feeling of being party to a slew of decisions that he disagreed with and felt powerless to influence.

Although State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs also has had a major role in arms transfers to Ukraine after Russia invaded last year, Paul’s academic background and career has long intertwined with Israel and the Palestinian territories. He wrote his master’s thesis about Israeli counterterrorism and civil rights, he said, and worked in Ramallah, in the West Bank, on security sector governance with the Palestinian Authority. And, in his resignation letter, he said he had “deep personal ties to both sides of the conflict.”

Paul said he spent last week on a preplanned leave, giving him more space to watch what was happening from the outside and to contemplate his decision. Since he publicly announced his resignation in a two-page declaration posted on LinkedIn, he said he had received many expressions of support from State Department colleagues.

Headline: U.S.-approved aid faces several hurdles to reach desperate Gazans

Description: Humanitarian experts warned of many obstacles before Palestinians in need receive support.

Content: Wrapping up a trip to Israel on Wednesday, Biden told reporters that up to 20 trucks of aid from Egypt would be allowed into the enclave through the Rafah border crossing once potholes along the road and damage from Israeli airstrikes had been repaired. Humanitarian officials warned, however, that a host of issues must still be resolved before the trucks can start moving.

“The diplomats are way behind in responding to an exploding emergency,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general for the Norwegian Refugee Council. “You now need a cease fire and you need massive access across several crossing points, even to be close to responding to the most acute needs as the entire population is now destitute.”

The Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas, has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years, leaving most of its 2.3 million residents dependent on aid even before the current conflict. Those deliveries stopped entirely when Israeli and Egyptian border crossings into Gaza were closed after Hamas militants killed at least 1,400 people in a surprise assault on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7.

An initial aid delivery will ease the crisis, experts said, but only fleetingly. “What is needed is consistent and unimpeded aid access into and within Gaza, not only for the entry of and safe passage of supplies but also for humanitarians to be able to undertake their work safely,” said Emma Beals, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute who researches the distribution of aid in conflict zones.

“We need more than just a promise that aid is allowed to go in,” Martin Griffiths, the emergency relief coordinator who oversees humanitarian aid at the United Nations, told The Washington Post on Wednesday. “Aid must go in at scale and daily.” U. N. Secretary General António Guterres echoed that point upon arriving in Cairo early Thursday, telling reporters he is seeking agreement on “sustained” humanitarian relief.

But U. S. officials were quick to describe the first trucks as a test balloon, with no guarantee of future deliveries if Hamas will interfere. “If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people,” Biden said, speaking aboard Air Force One as he departed Israel. “As a practical matter it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.”

Humanitarian officials emphasized the United Nations has established monitoring mechanisms in place for aid that crosses into Gaza. The European Union also has an assistance mission that operates at the Rafah border crossing in Egypt and could be called upon to inspect the trucks upon entry. It was unclear Thursday whether these agencies had been contacted about helping to monitor the aid route.

Discussions on inspections were still “ongoing,” U. S. and U.N. officials told The Post on Thursday. News reports in Arab media and elsewhere that a deal had been reached were “premature,” one official said. Another said the talks are “close, but not there yet.” Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.

“It is outrageous to hold back emergency relief for children, women and families because they fear aid diversion. Most of the stuff that goes in, the fighting men are well stocked on, they do not need bottled water or baby powder,” Egeland said, adding that existing monitoring mechanisms can and should be implemented without delay.

More than 100 aid trucks were lined up Thursday in the Egyptian city of Arish, waiting for a greenlight to move to Rafah. On the other side of the border, Palestinians struggled to understand why the initial deliveries would be so small or how they would actually reach people in Gaza.

Mohamed Zanoon, an independent photographer who was working to document the aftermath of the Israeli air raids, said he was witnessing a “humanitarian catastrophe.” He has struggled to push from his mind the memories of children screaming beneath the rubble. “Twenty trucks is not enough,” he said by phone. “More than a million people need medical care in Gaza.”

Among the thorniest remaining questions is whether fuel will be allowed on the trucks. Without its regular deliveries, the last power plant in Gaza went dark last week, robbing the enclave of regular electricity. Hospitals have since struggled to keep the lights on with diesel generators. Doctors warn a total blackout would be a death sentence for patients on life support, in the operating theater and to newborns in incubators.

As news of the impending deal filtered through Gaza, residents described the aid effort as a drop in the ocean, and they fretted over whether they would receive anything all. “Okay, it is something,” said Yousef Hammash, a father of two from Gaza City. “At least we have it. Now we have to have a truce to distribute it. How are they going to do it under bombardment?”

Griffiths, from the United Nations, said humanitarian officials have been engaged in “incredibly detailed negotiations” about what an aid program to southern Gaza would look like. He said relief workers need assurances that they will be able to deliver aid consistently and reach people where they are “in the places that they choose to be safe.”

For many Palestinians, nowhere in Gaza feels safe. The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Wednesday that Israeli warplanes bombed five bakeries in different locations, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds as they lined up to buy bread. Medics and aid workers have also been killed off duty, sometimes as they left work to check on their families.

“The streets are not safe, and the entire population is in need,” Hammash said. “Every day we have to do our challenging mission of getting bread and water.” He moved his family from Gaza City to Khan Younis this week after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of over 1 million civilians in the northern part of the enclave. But the mass displacement has put such strain on resources in the south that Hammash said some people were now heading back home. “Either you get bombed in the north or you die from hunger here,” he said.

Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas cling to digital cluesHadas Kalderon, a resident of Kibbutz Nir Oz, in an apartment in Tel Aviv on Thursday. Two of her children have been taken hostage by Hamas. (Ofir Berman for The Washington Post) TEL AVIV — At 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 7, Hadas Kalderon received the last message from her son.“Mom, be quiet, don’t move,” Erez, 12, texted. Hamas militants had stormed his father’s house, in their southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Oz, where he and his 16-year-old sister, Sahar, had spent the night. Erez and his sister had jumped out the window and were hiding in the bushes. But he was thinking of his mother, just down the road, trying to protect her. Gunmen were rampaging through their tiny pastoral community, shooting entire families, some at point-blank range, as they clung to each other in beds and safe rooms.“I love you forever. I hope you survive,” she texted back. There was no reply.For hours, Hadas called Erez’s cellphone again and again, even as she fought for her life, physically blocking militants from breaking down her safe room door. She heard them screaming, “Allahu akbar” as they set fire to parts of her home.When Israeli forces finally arrived in the late afternoon, the Kalderon family emerged from hiding, and Hadas’s older daughter found an 18-second video circulating on social media. It showed Erez in a black T-shirt, being gripped by both arms and led into captivity. The militants referred to Erez and another group of children who do not appear in the shot as “child settlers.”Kalderon has replaced eating and sleeping with chain-smoking. Her voice is raw from overuse. She is in a “living hell,” she said, having told her children for years not to be afraid. Now, “the nightmare has come true.”Five members of the family were taken, including Erez, Sahar and their 50-year-old father, Ofer; their 80-year-old grandmother, Carmela, and a 12-year-old cousin, Noya, were grabbed from another house in the community. There are 203 people being held hostage in Gaza, according to the Israeli government, including civilians with passports from at least 31 other countries.Hadas’s childhood friend from Nir Oz, whose relatives are also being held in Gaza, has commandeered her cellphone, shielding her from the relentless, looping horrors on social media — the celebrations of the bloodshed, the parading of humiliated captives, some stripped down to their underwear, others huddled together in what could be Hamas’s vast network of tunnels. In one case, militants uploaded a video showing the killing of an elderly woman to her own Facebook page. Her granddaughter discovered it.The militants’ decision to film their reign of terror has deepened the anguish of Israelis, but it has also given experts in Israel’s vaunted cybersecurity and intelligence sectors a great deal of evidence to work with. They are leading a grass-roots effort now to comb through the footage and the photographs for clues about where hostages are being held.“The state has the tools and the information, but they don’t have the apparatus to work as quickly as we do,” said Ido Har-Tuv, a former member of Shin Bet, Israel’s secretive national security service, and the chief executive of Gitam BBDO — an advertising agency that has opened a makeshift “war room” out of its offices in a gleaming high-rise in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hahayal, Israel’s Silicon Valley.“We’re running our operation here like a lean, efficient start-up,” Har-Tuv said. “We don’t have time.”Many of the roughly 100 men and women in the “war room” have deep military and intelligence experience, and some are being called up by Israel’s most elite units. They include 8200, the Israeli military’s cyberintelligence division, and Duvdevan, its undercover counterterrorism unit, which was the basis for the Netflix series “Fauda.”Refael Franco, the former deputy head of the National Cyber Directorate, is overseeing the construction of the group’s platform, which is based on cutting-edge AI and facial recognition technology. It is a sophisticated system that cross-checks images posted by militants posted on social media against photos of the hostages provided by families. When a match occurs, the system can geolocate — within seconds — the approximate location of a missing person. Open-source intelligence experts then try to zero in further, relying on contextual clues like mosques, local shops or the angle of the sun.The teams have already built a database of an estimated 1,000 people, including hostages and hostage takers. They are getting personnel and logistical help from Google, which has offices across town. They have shared their platform with Israeli security officials, who will use it to further their own search.Hamas took at least 64 captives into Gaza, visual evidence suggestsBut it is a time-consuming and inexact process. One of the biggest challenges, Franco said, is that hostages have been moved repeatedly.“That being said, every time someone picks up their phone and uploads footage in the strip, we can cross-check it in the system to know where they are,” he said. They will keep following the digital clues, he said, for “as long as this mission takes.”Most of the videos were filmed and posted during or shortly after the initial abductions, flooding social media sites such as Telegram, Facebook, Snapchat and X, formerly known as Twitter — oftentimes all at once. Many were easy to find because they were posted with the same set of hashtags. In rare instances, Palestinian gunmen could be heard discussing where to take their captives.One set of videos, believed to be filmed by militants and passersby in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, showed a hostage being led by gunmen; on a wall in the background was a phone number of a local businessman, tipping off the team to the neighborhood.“We’re figuring all of this out as we go,” said one volunteer, among a group hunched over their laptops as they toggled through spreadsheets filled with translated posts, hashtags and geolocations.The man spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a reservist with Duvdevan. As time goes on, he said, the militants are posting less and, when they do, they are focusing more on themselves and their injuries.And as Israel expands its punishing air campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 3,700 people, hostage takers may lose electricity or cell reception and go dark entirely.Kalderon has not turned on the news since the attack. All she knows is that 80 of her 400 neighbors are dead or missing. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.She was unaware of the grass-roots efforts to locate the hostages, but she was not surprised. Across Israel, civilians have mobilized to provide aid to victims in the south and equipment to the troops, filling gaps left by the government.For a week and a half, Kalderon and her relatives heard nothing from Israeli officials about the status of their loved ones, or efforts to bring them home.On Wednesday, a military notification officer told Kalderon that her mother, Carmela — a peacenik immigrant from New York who for years helped Gazans receive medical treatment in Israel — and her autistic niece Noya — who was sleeping over at her grandmother’s — were both dead. There was no information about the others.Kalderon and other relatives of hostages say have they experienced a double trauma: first left to fend for themselves when militants overran their communities, now left to navigate a deafening silence from their government.“Every second, every second, that our children are there is one second too much, and yet all Netanyahu talks about is ‘winning the war,’” said Kalderon, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.He has met with only a handful of families — days after President Biden and members of his administration first reached out to them — and has provided few assurances.Kalderon, who also holds French citizenship, has met with French diplomats, including former prime minister Manuel Valls. But she is terrified that her own government, in preparing for a full-scale invasion of Gaza, may cast her children off as collateral damage.“We are simple people; we are good citizens,” she said. “We gave whatever we could to our country. It’s the Israeli government that just forgot us.”Israel-Gaza war: Israel’s military said it rescued two hostages from the southern Gazan city of Rafah while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza’s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing political pressure to reach a hostage release deal, after rejecting a cease-fire and vowing to continue war.Middle East conflict: Tensions in the region continue to rise.

ARTICLE NUMBER 152

Headline: Biden urges help for Israel and Ukraine in high-stakes Oval Office speech

Description: President links two conflicts as he makes a sweeping argument on America’s global role

Content: “American leadership is what holds the world together,” he added. “American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it’s just not worth it.”

The speech culminated an extraordinary week for Biden, who set aside his schedule for a whirlwind trip into a war zone to appear alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The trip is likely to stand out as a signature moment of his presidency, though the outcome is far from certain as the Middle East remains engulfed in violent turmoil.

While emphasizing the steadfast U. S. support of Israel, Biden reiterated his warning against being driven by fury. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, he said, “We made mistakes. So I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage. And here in America, let us not forget who we are.”

U. N. Secretary General António Guterres on Thursday urged “rapid, unimpeded access for humanitarian aid” to the Palestinian enclave, citing an “ever-mounting toll” on civilians who have lacked water, food, fuel and electricity for more than a week. Hospitals in Gaza are being overrun with casualties from Israeli airstrikes, with patients sleeping on floors and some facilities turning off lights off to save energy, according to Palestinian health authorities.

The portion of the aid package going to Israel would be aimed at strengthening the country’s Iron Dome air defense system, Biden said. The United States has already positioned two aircraft carriers and their escort ships near Israel and sent thousands of soldiers and Marines to staff them, driven by concern that the conflict could flare into a broader regional war.

He will have to overcome resistance from a significant number of House Republicans who have been agitating to slash aid to Ukraine — in some cases, to nothing. America, they argue, has little at stake in a faraway war between two remote countries, and the money would be better spent on such uses as securing America’s southern border.

Public support for Ukraine is also slipping. A Washington Post-ABC poll last month found 41 percent of Americans said the United States was doing too much to support Ukraine, while 50 percent said it was doing about the right amount or too little. Among Republicans, however, 59 percent said the United States was doing too much to aid Kyiv.

Reflecting that dynamic, Biden spent a good portion of his address warning about the risks of abandoning Ukraine to Putin’s aggression. He recalled the secretive trip he made to Kyiv in February with only a handful of security agents accompanying him, a visit that in some ways was similar to his trip Wednesday to Israel while it was in a state of war.

At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the unprecedented cross-border Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities have said, when militants hunted down and attacked civilians. Palestinian officials have said that 3,785 people in Gaza have been killed and more than 12,400 wounded in the airstrikes that Israel has launched in response.

Headline: Gaza’s collapsing health system shows struggles of medical care in war

Description: Dire scenarios await Gaza’s hospitals as they face dwindling basic resources and damage from airstrikes in the Israel-Gaza war.

Content: The Gaza Strip’s health-care system stands on the brink of collapse as bombings damage hospitals and ambulances and as generators run out of fuel, highlighting how quality medical care is a casualty of war. Dire scenarios await Gaza’s medical professionals. They face dwindling basic resources such as power, water and anesthesia, compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save. The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health-care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human-made and natural disasters — assessing staffing and other resources, managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones, and looking out for their own welfare.

“When we are in a disaster setting or conflict, we usually have more patients than resources. We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people,” said Lindsey Ryan Martin, who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza.

“Health workers, why would they stay?” Griffiths said. “And how can you move the sick people that we’ve already been discussing for the last few days, coming out of the hospital in Gaza City — how can you move them when they’re in ICUs?”

An anesthesia specialist at al-Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed. He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene: patients being treated on a teal floor, a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient.

The hospital worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters, worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply. He’s already seeing infections, diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children.

The hospital worker said he last slept properly on Oct. 5, before the conflict began, and doesn’t know whether his home is still standing. “It’s also the last time I saw my wife and my kids,” he said.

Erica L. Nelson, who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years, said Palestinian doctors at al-Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted. “The additional component of ‘We are at risk’ has changed the tenor of the conversation,” said Nelson, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply. Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities “extremely dangerous,” according to Doctors Without Borders, which has staff on the ground in Gaza. The U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients. All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel.

“When fuel runs out, that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that don’t require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services,” said John Broach, director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester, Mass.

Broach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated, such as people with well-managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies.

“Soon all the team is burned out, their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions,” said Callaway, who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine.

The decisions health-care workers face in disasters are momentous: As they focus on the patient in front of them, they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere. “You feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment,” Callaway said. “Is a kid’s life more valuable than an elderly person’s?”

Resources simply were not available to treat everyone in need, he said. “You can be forced into a situation where you can’t do what’s best for your patient, either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die,” Kirsch said.

Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do. As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide, Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could, amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures. “You have no choice,” he said. “You tell yourself you’ll probably do it better than a layperson.”

The health-care system in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, already struggled before the war. The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods, which can restrict care. Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014, when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50-day Israeli offensive in Gaza.

Headline: Historic church sheltering civilians struck in deadly Gaza City blast

Description: The Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza’s oldest active church, was sheltering hundreds of Muslims and Christians displaced by the war, according to religious officials.

Content: JERUSALEM — The historic Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza’s oldest active church, was struck Thursday by Israel as it sheltered hundreds of Palestinians displaced by the war, according to religious officials. Maher Ayyad, 72, a member of the community, said the strike hit a two-story building in the church compound, killing 18 people and injuring at least 20. About 100 people were in the bombed building at the time of the strike, he said, and about 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.

Amash tweeted Friday afternoon that several relatives who had been sheltering in the church, including two women he identified as Viola and Yara, were killed in the strike.

There are about 1,000 Palestinian Christians remaining in Gaza, and the loss was “huge” for the community, Ayyad said. About 500 Christians, including Ayyad, have relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.

The Washington Post geolocated the strike and confirmed the location of the church based on a video that shows people searching through rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem blamed Israel for the strike.

The Israel Defense Forces said in an emailed statement that a strike targeting a Hamas control center “damaged the wall of a church in the area” and that it was “aware of reports on casualties” and was reviewing the incident. They declined to provide further information and reiterated, “It is important to clarify that the Church was not the target of the strike.”

Ayyad is also a medical director at al-Ahli Hospital, where a blast Tuesday killed 471 people and injured more than 300, according to Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has disputed that death toll.

The Order of St. George, an associated order of the church, issued a statement confirming Thursday’s strike. “Archbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don’t know if he is injured,” the Order of St. George stated. The blast hit “two church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping.”

The Church of St. Porphyrius’s original structure dated to the 5th century, and the current structure, in a historic quarter of the city, was built in the 12th century. It is named for a former bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, and placed where he is believed to have died in A. D. 420. The church, characterized by thick walls and a richly decorated interior, has long been a place of refuge and community for its members, who are a religious minority in the Gaza Strip.

A Palestinian American woman who moved from Gaza to the United States in the early 2000s said in an interview that she had relatives and friends sheltering in the church at the time of the strike, some of whom were injured.

“They’re terrified. They’re shaken. They don’t know what to do, and they don’t know where else to go,” said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her family’s safety. She expressed outrage at the idea that more than 1 million civilians could evacuate from a place as densely populated and heavily bombed as Gaza City — a mass movement called for by Israel last week. “It’s impossible,” she said.

She said that she grew up going to the Church of St. Porphyrius and that her family has deep ties to the church, dating to when they became refugees during the 1948 founding of Israel and mass displacement of Palestinians.

Describing the congregation as close-knit and family-like, she said she’s not only worried about her relatives. “I’m concerned for everyone because we’re a small community.”

Christians make up about 1 percent of Gaza’s population and have faced restrictions and discrimination by the Hamas government, according to human rights groups. During the 2014 Gaza war, about 1,000 Palestinian Muslims fled Israeli shelling for the Church of St. Porphyrius, where graves were damaged by shrapnel from a nearby strike, Reuters reported.

Headline: What a ground war in Gaza could look like

Description: To dismantle Hamas, the IDF would have to fight in Gaza’s dense neighborhoods, adding to the risks civilians are facing.

Content: Israeli troops are massing around the Gaza Strip, poised for a ground invasion that could involve heavy urban combat in the densely populated territory. The buildup of force comes after attackers from the militant group Hamas, which controls the enclave, crossed into southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages.

The Israel Defense Forces have already pummeled the strip with airstrikes, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian officials.

Israel withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005. In 2008 and 2014, Israeli forces entered the territory in multiweek campaigns that Israel said were aimed at impeding Hamas’s capabilities.

The fighting killed more than 3,500 Palestinians and more than 70 Israeli soldiers in total.

This operation may be much more extensive. Israel has vowed to “destroy” Hamas.

“Basically, what the Israelis are aiming for is complete regime change in Gaza, which is a notable break from” past campaigns, said Raphael Cohen, a senior political scientist at Rand Corp. He expected a long, brutal fight. “If you want to root out Hamas, it’s going to last a lot more than 50 days like Protective Edge,” said Cohen, referring to the IDF’s 2014 operation.

Many civilians have already been killed in Gaza and 1 million have been displaced according to the United Nations.

“A ground campaign will inevitably have grave implications for civilians in Gaza,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “The dense urban nature of the [Gaza Strip] will ensure that such an operation will face fierce resistance and will require massive use of force by Israel.”

He added that “Hamas’s practice of storing and using rockets and military assets among civilians and in humanitarian facilities will further increase the exposure of civilians to risk.”

To dismantle Hamas, the IDF, one of the world’s most powerful militaries, would have to fight in Gaza’s dense neighborhoods with limited space to maneuver.

Hamas, which analysts say spent at least two years planning the rampage that caught Israeli forces by surprise, is likely to have prepared for a large-scale retaliation.

A ground offensive into Gaza could compound the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis there.

An Israeli siege on the enclave has meant almost all its fuel and power are gone. Food, drinking water and medical supplies are running out.

“It seems that major ground operations are likely to focus on Gaza City, at least initially, with perhaps limited ground incursions elsewhere,” said Michael Eisenstadt, director of the military and security studies program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “But air and naval artillery strikes are likely to continue against targets throughout the Gaza Strip.”

Israel has urged Gazans to evacuate to the south, away from Gaza City, before a ground incursion, but on Tuesday the United Nations cited reports “that civilians attempting to relocate to southern Gaza were struck and killed by an explosive weapon.” The southern Rafah crossing into Egypt remains closed.

“What makes this round even more concerning is that it is likely to extend for an unprecedented period of time, where civilians will not only be exposed to direct risk of death and injury from the fighting, but also to protracted, severe shortages of basic humanitarian needs,” al-Omari said.

Headline: Aid remains stalled as U.N. chief visits Rafah crossing

Description: The aid convoy has been held up for days in Egypt at the only crossing to Gaza not controlled by Israel.

Content: “We are witnessing a paradox: Behind these walls, we have 2 million people that is suffering enormously — that has no water, no food, no medicine, no fuel; that is under fire; that needs everything to survive,” Guterres said. “On this side, we have seen so many trucks, loaded with water, with fuel, with medicines, with food — exactly the same things that are needed on this side of the wall.”

U. N. officials had hoped that Guterres’s media tour Friday would coincide with the resumption of trucks driving across the border — a moment of triumph and relief after days of high-level, high-stakes diplomacy in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Instead, Guterres found himself facing stalled trucks and angry Egyptian aid workers, frustrated at the wait to bring assistance to Palestinians just a few miles away.

The aid convoy — and the difficult dealmaking to get it across the border — represent the opening gambit in efforts to seek a steady flow of relief supplies into Gaza. On Saturday, Egyptian officials plan to host a “summit for peace,” which Guterres is scheduled to attend before returning to New York.

Inside Gaza, however, Palestinians told The Washington Post that distributing the aid would be extremely dangerous for them without a halt in Israeli airstrikes, which have continued across the coastal enclave, including in areas in the south that Israel said would be considered safe zones.

That’s a fraction of the more than 200 trucks from the United Nations, Egyptian Red Crescent and other sources that are ready to deliver supplies to Gaza. Guterres said the details of how the aid will be verified and whether it will be a continuous flow remain under discussion.

“We are now actively engaged with” Israel, Egypt and the United States, he said. “Those verifications need to be effective, and at the same time, those verifications need to be done in a way that is practical and in a way that is expedited.”

The United Nations has offered up their inspectors, who have conducted similar checks on aid entering northwest Syria. But a key sticking point has been that the Israelis want “direct eyes” on the crossing, said an official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the delicate negotiations. “The question is where and how,” the official said.

“We demand the opening of the crossing so we can support our Palestinian brothers,” said Abdelrahman El-Sayid, 22, a volunteer with Abnaa Sinai, a regional logistics company that also does charity work. He had been stuck there for four days, waiting to bring medicine and food aid across to Gaza, he said.

Ahead of his visit to the crossing, Guterres inspected a flight at the Arish airport carrying supplies destined for Gaza. The plane included 44 tons of food supplies donated by the United Arab Emirates, 17 tons of materials for tents and 10 tons of emergency trauma kits to be distributed by the United Nations and the Egyptian Red Crescent.

“We need to have as quickly as possible the first convoy, and we need to create all the guarantees for that first convoy not to be the last,”  Guterres told reporters on the tarmac.

Since Oct. 7, Israel has tightened its siege on Gaza, and airstrikes have damaged parts of the Rafah crossing on the Gazan side. The war has also displaced around 1 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people. More than half of the displaced are sheltering in United Nation schools, hospitals and storage centers, according to the U. N.’s refugee agency.

Al-Qudra said Friday that seven hospitals were completely closed due to Israeli shelling and another 21 medical centers shut after running out of fuel. Fuel for the generators at al-Shifa Hospital, the main hospital in Gaza City and one of the few remaining places with electricity, will run out within 24 hours, Guillemette Thomas, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday.

Headline: Hamas releases two Americans it held captive in Gaza

Description: Judith and Natalie Raanan of Illinois were visiting Israel for a family birthday and the High Holy Days when they were taken captive by the militant group Oct. 7.

Content: JERUSALEM — Hamas released two American hostages on Friday, U. S. and Israeli officials said, the first of the at least 200 captives the militant group has held since it rampaged through Israeli towns two weeks ago.The mother and daughter, released to the Red Cross in Gaza, were transferred to an Israeli military team and escorted to an army base in Israel to be reunited with their family members, officials said.

The pair, identified as Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie Raanan, of Evanston, Ill., were in Israel to visit family when they were kidnapped from Nahal Oz, a kibbutz not far from the border fence breached by Hamas fighters. The group said it released them at the request of Qatari mediators for “humanitarian reasons.”

Until Friday, Hamas had ignored demands from Israel and pleas from Western governments to free the captives, many of whom are children, ill or elderly. Israel has said it would not allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza through its territory until the hostages were freed. Human rights groups have said taking civilian hostages is an unambiguous war crime. President Biden has called Hamas’s actions “pure evil.”

Biden, who asked Congress on Friday to authorize a sweeping aid package for Israel, said U. S. officials and their allies were “working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas.” He pledged to continue pushing for the release of all still being held.

“Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,” Biden said in a statement.

Inside the Palestinian enclave, a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding: Nearly 2 million people have been cut off from food, water, fuel and medicine as they weather a relentless Israeli bombing campaign. Hospitals faced with dire shortages were on “the brink of collapse,” the United Nations reported.

Biden, who said this week that Israel and Egypt had assured him they would allow the aid trucks to pass, announced Friday that the crossing would open “in the next 24 to 48 hours.”

Elsewhere along the border, the Israeli military was massing troops and armored vehicles in preparation for the anticipated ground invasion of the densely populated territory. The operation would involve heavy urban combat and almost certainly would lead to an escalation in civilian casualties, analysts said.

As Israel prepared for a ground war, and besieged bystanders braced for its likely consequences, Amnesty International said it had found “damning evidence” of Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Amnesty investigators said Israeli attacks have destroyed block after block of residential buildings and critical infrastructure and caused “mass civilian casualties.”

From Egypt to Indonesia and in several American cities, demonstrators again took to the streets, shouting down Israel and its allies, especially the United States, and demanding an immediate cease-fire.

Israeli strikes have killed 4,137 people in Gaza and wounded more than 13,200, Palestinian officials say. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli officials say. Hamas, rampaging through villages and kibbutz settlements, took more than 200 people hostage.

Ten Americans remained unaccounted for, Blinken said, and authorities knew that Hamas was holding at least some of them hostage. Diplomats were working feverishly to secure their release, Blinken said. He declined to share further details.

The Raanans’ release spurred more urgent calls for the remaining hostages to be set free. The Hostages and Missing Families forum, a group in Israel, sought to pressure Arab leaders in the region to work to return their loved ones safely.

A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli authorities “will continue to operate with the best of their abilities and efforts in order to locate all of the missing and return all of the abductees home.”
