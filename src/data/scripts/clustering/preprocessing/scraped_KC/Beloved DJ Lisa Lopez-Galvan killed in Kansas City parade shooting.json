    "description": "A shooting near the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl parade killed one person and injured 22. Lisa Lopez-Galvan\u2019s radio station, KKFI, announced her death.",
    "content": "It was just like any other Tuesday night. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Lopez-Galvan was on air for her weekly radio show, \u201cA Taste of Tejano,\u201d sharing her love of music. The program features Tejano music, a \u201cTex-Mex\u201d fusion of Mexican and American musical influences.\u201cLet us know if you have a birthday, anniversary or special announcement!\u201d Lopez-Galvan wrote on Facebook before her show, as she often did.\n\nOnce the show was over, she and her co-host, Tommy Andrade, parted ways \u2014 not knowing that it would be their last time together.\n\nPolice said one person was killed and 22 were injured but have not named any of the victims. Their ages range from 8 to 47 years old.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among \u201cseveral\u201d people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two, volunteered on the show before joining as a full-time programmer and co-host about two years ago, said Andrade, her co-host and family friend, remembering her as a kind person with an infectious smile. \u201cShe treated everyone she knew and loved as close family,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cShe will be missed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lopez-Galvan\u2019s radio station, her adult son was shot in the leg at the rally but had been released from the hospital.\n\nIn a statement, the Lopez-Galvan family said: \u201cWe thank the community for their prayers and support during this difficult time. We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one \u2026 who was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ask to please keep our family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of Lisa\u2019s death while also supporting our other loved ones who were impacted in this senseless act,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAbarca choked up as he recalled his conversation Wednesday with one of Lopez-Galvan\u2019s cousins. Both broke down in tears. Then the cousin told him: \u201cWhat you need to do is do your job and change this.\u201d\n\nThroughout her life, serving others was a key part of Lopez-Galvan\u2019s life \u2014 from assisting people who didn\u2019t speak English as a court clerk, to helping people in her community find jobs, according to a 2021 profile in the local newspaper Dos Mundos. She was bilingual in English and Spanish, her profile on KKFI said.\n\nIn an interview with Kansas City Hispanic News late last year, Lopez-Galvan credited her father, who played in local Mexican bands after arriving in Kansas City in his youth, for her love of music.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank him, because if it wasn\u2019t for him and the music I listened to growing up, I wouldn\u2019t have this passion for music,\u201d she said.\n\nThe last Facebook post she wrote before her final show \u2014 where she asked for birthdays, anniversaries or other special occasions \u2014 has now become a place for people to mourn a woman they never knew.\n\nBut for those who listened or knew her, it\u2019s also a place to remember a kind individual who \u201calways wanted to help others,\u201d as one person wrote."
