    "description": "One person died and more than 20 others were wounded when gunfire broke out at the end of a rally for the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl victory",
    "content": "Police said Thursday that they were sorting out why gunfire erupted between several people at the conclusion of Wednesday\u2019s rally for the Chiefs, leaving one Johnson County mother of two dead and more than 20 with gunshot wounds, at least half of them under age 16. Two juveniles were in police custody Thursday as the investigation continued, police said.\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor, Quinton Lucas (D), said in interviews that while a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade next month would continue as scheduled, the city may have to contemplate holding a much smaller rally at Arrowhead Stadium if the Chiefs win another Super Bowl so fans can be sent through metal detectors beforehand.\n\nWith parades planned for St. Patrick\u2019s Day next month, \u201cmy city and many American cities will be tested,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIs this just something we live with in the same way that we\u2019re living with school shootings and the threat to movie theaters and the threat to bowling alleys?\u201d\n\nLucas said he had spoken Thursday morning with Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) about a 2022 shooting \u2014 allegedly by a 21-year-old man armed with an semiautomatic rifle \u2014 that left seven people dead and several dozen wounded at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park. Lucas said he told Pritzker that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.\u201d\n\nThe tragedy seemed to hit especially hard in Kansas City, a smaller market which has always had an outsize love for its National Football League team \u2014 even in the lean years between Super Bowl appearances and before the white-hot attention drawn by tight end Travis Kelce\u2019s romance with musician Taylor Swift. Local reporters covering the shooting Wednesday wept during their standups, and morning radio shows Thursday turned into therapy sessions for heartbroken fans.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Kansas City,\u201d grieving residents said over and over, echoing the words Wednesday of the city\u2019s police chief. But, in a way, it is \u2014 the city has long suffered from gang violence and hit a record number of homicides last year at 184. Just last month, a shooting between parties at a food court in the mall just steps from the rally grounds left six injured.\n\nIn the chaos following Wednesday\u2019s violence, panicked fans scaled barricades and took refuge in the city\u2019s iconic Union Station, where the public officials and Chiefs players and coaches had been rushed for their safety. The famous and their fans huddled, barricaded in rooms and trying to comfort children separated from their parents.\n\n\u201cThis is SAD man! Kids are being shot and somebody didn\u2019t come home tonight,\u201d Chiefs safety Justin Reid wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWe cannot allow this to be normal. We cannot [allow] ourselves to become numb and chalk it up to \u2018just another shooting in America\u2019 and reduce people in statistics and then move on tmrw.\n\nAfterward, Abarca, 35, texted the county\u2019s general counsel and said he wanted the attorney to draft language on gun control measures within days, no matter that by state law, localities may not be able to enact such changes. \u201cWe cannot just sit here and do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 parades \u2014 which wind through downtown Kansas City and end up with a rally at Union Station \u2014 are rowdy affairs, with the players jumping off the buses to mingle with the fans on the sidelines, signing autographs and high-fiving. Footballs arc through the air, and plenty of alcohol is consumed by players and spectators.\n\nIn that climate, he said, tensions between people can quickly erupt into violence. \u201cWhen you have actors who don\u2019t have any regard for the safety of other individuals and they\u2019re just thinking of their own beef, then these things can happen,\u201d he said."
