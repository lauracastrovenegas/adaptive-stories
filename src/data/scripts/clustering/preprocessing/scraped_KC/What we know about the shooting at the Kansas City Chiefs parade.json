    "content": "One person was killed and at least 22 were injured at a rally after a parade Wednesday celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 win at the Super Bowl. Shots were fired near Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., where Chiefs players had addressed the fan rally. Video showed people running from the site and police entering the building.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among \u201cseveral\u201d people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLisa Lopez-Galvan, a radio DJ and host of \u201cA Taste of Tejano\u201d on Kansas City radio station KKFI, was killed in the shooting, Tommy Andrade, a family friend and co-host of the show, told The Washington Post. Andrade said Lopez-Galvan\u2019s husband, Mike, informed him of her death. In a statement, the station called her death a \u201csenseless act.\u201d\n\nAndrade described Lopez-Galvan, a mother of two, as a kind person with an infectious smile. \u201cShe treated everyone she knew and loved as close family. She will be missed,\u201d he said.\n\nEight of those injured had immediately life-threatening injuries, and seven others had life-threatening injuries, Kansas City interim fire chief Ross Grundyson told reporters. Six others were considered to have minor injuries, he said.\n\nPolice have taken three people into custody and recovered firearms but have not yet disclosed a motive. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said the shooting happened despite a heavy police presence because of \u201cbad actors.\u201d Hundreds of law enforcement officers were policing the parade, she said, which allowed for a quick response.\n\nLaw enforcement has asked anyone who might have video of the shooting or of alleged shooters fleeing the scene to submit it to an FBI portal as authorities work to investigate the motive.\n\nThe shooting is the latest high-profile example of the entrenched problem of gun violence in the United States. President Biden said Wednesday that the shooting in Kansas City should \u201cshock us\u201d into acting to limit gun violence.\n\n\u201cThis is difficult for our community,\u201d Lucas said in a statement posted to social media. \u201cWe will continue to work hard to ensure assailants are brought to justice, our victims receive exceptional care, all families impacted receive our support and that we as a city and country do all we can to prevent tragedies like this from ever occurring again.\u201d\n\nTravis Kelce, the celebrated Chiefs tight end, also said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the parade shooting. \u201cMy heart is with all who came out to celebrate with us and have been affected. KC, you mean the world to me,\u201d he said in a post on social media."
