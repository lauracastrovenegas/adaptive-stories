  "text": "More than 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip have been released since they were taken in the cross-border Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Estimates for the total number of hostages seized in the attack that left at least 1,200 people dead in Israel have shifted over the course of the war. As of Wednesday, an estimated 107 living hostages remain in captivity in Gaza, according to numbers provided by Israel, but the country has not given the full basis for its estimates.\n\nA deal between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar, paused the fighting on Nov. 24 and allowed for the release of women and children in exchange for Palestinian women and teens in Israeli prisons. However, fighting restarted Dec. 1, with Israeli warplanes resuming strikes in Gaza.\n\nDuring the pause, 81 Israeli citizens — including those who also hold citizenship from other countries — were released. Under the deal’s framework, every Israeli hostage freed would initiate the release of three Palestinian prisoners. Outside the framework of the exchange deal, 24 foreign nationals — who do not hold Israeli citizenship — were freed. Before the deal, some hostages — including two Americans — were also released or rescued.\n\nThe specific number of hostages who have died in captivity and the ages, genders and nationalities of those remaining in Gaza are unclear. Israel has estimated that the majority of those remaining have Israeli citizenship and are male. It’s unclear how many are members of the Israeli military. Two Americans — Abigail Edan, 4, and Liat Beinin Atzili, 49 — were released under the exchange deal. Fewer than 10 U. S. citizens are now held hostage, according to the White House.\n\nWhile Hamas is thought to hold most of the hostages, some are believed to be held by other militant groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose fighters also took part in the Oct. 7 attack. Israel blames Hamas for the deaths of some hostages and said three were killed in its own operations; Hamas says Israeli strikes have killed some hostages. The Washington Post could not independently verify either side’s claims.\n\nHere is a list of the hostages released and what is known about those who remain.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nIsrael has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars in GazaThe damage in Gaza has outpaced other recent conflicts, evidence shows. Israel has dropped some of the largest bombs commonly used today near hospitals. Data from the United Nations shows damage and destruction around al-Rantisi Hospital in northern Gaza. (MAXAR/The Washington Post) Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has been unlike any other in the 21st century.In response to the unprecedented assault by Hamas on Oct. 7, Israeli airstrikes and a ground invasion that began 20 days later have destroyed large swaths of the besieged territory, killed at least 20,057 people and displaced a vast majority of the population.The most ferocious attacks have come from the air, flattening entire city blocks and cratering the landscape.The Washington Post analyzed satellite imagery, airstrike data and U.N. damage assessments, and interviewed more than 20 aid workers, health-care providers, and experts in munitions and aerial warfare. The evidence shows that Israel has carried out its war in Gaza at a pace and level of devastation that likely exceeds any recent conflict, destroying more buildings, in far less time, than were destroyed during the Syrian regime’s battle for Aleppo from 2013 to 2016 and the U.S.-led campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, in 2017.The Post also found that the Israeli military has conducted repeated and widespread airstrikes in proximity to hospitals, which are supposed to receive special protection under the laws of war. Satellite imagery reviewed by Post reporters revealed dozens of apparent craters near 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza, where the bombing and fighting were most intense during the first two months of war, including 10 craters that suggested the use of bombs weighing 2,000 pounds, the largest in regular use.“There’s no safe space. Period,” said Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who visited Gaza on Dec. 4. “I haven’t passed one street where I didn’t see destruction of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.”Press Enter to skip to end of carouselHow we calculated this damage comparisonTo assess the devastation in Gaza, The Post used data from the U.N. Satellite Center, or UNOSAT, which analyzes satellite imagery from conflict zones to determine how many structures, most of them buildings, have been damaged and destroyed.To compare with Gaza, The Post examined UNOSAT damage data from the Russian and Syrian government campaign against rebels in Aleppo from 2013 to 2016, and from the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, which heavily bombed and shelled the cities of Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, in 2017. UNOSAT has not collected the same kind of data on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Despite the availability of other damage assessment methodologies, The Post relied on UNOSAT data because it maintained a consistent methodology over years across multiple conflict zones.The war has wounded more than 53,320 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. More than 7,700 Palestinian children have been killed, and women and children make up around 70 percent of the dead, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which also says that 1.9 million people have been displaced, equivalent to 85 percent of the population. The vast majority of Gazan civilians fleeing the invasion are not allowed by Israel and Egypt to leave.“The scale of Palestinian civilian deaths in such a short period of time appears to be the highest such civilian casualty rate in the 21st century,” said Michael Lynk, who served as the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories from 2016 to 2022.In a reply to questions from The Post, the Israel Defense Forces sent a statement saying: “In response to Hamas’ barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities. In stark contrast to Hamas’ intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.”This is the Gaza Strip. Each dot represents a damaged or destroyed structure, the vast majority of which are buildings. From the start of the war on Oct. 7 to Nov. 26, the date of the most recent data available, 37,379 structures were damaged.Of those damaged structures, 10,049 were completely destroyed.The bombing campaign and ground combat during this period were the worst in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops entered overnight Oct. 27 and fought close-quarters battles with Hamas fighters.Here, 8,561 structures were completely destroyed. These destroyed structures were among 29,732 damaged in northern Gaza alone.This is Aleppo, more than 1½ times the area of northern Gaza. Russia and the government of Bashar al-Assad waged a brutal, multiyear battle to defeat and eventually besiege rebel groups there.From 2013 to 2016, the period covered by U.N. data, 40 percent of Aleppo’s structures were damaged. In northern Gaza, that figure reached 32 percent by Nov. 26 — seven weeks into conflict.Nearly twice as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza in seven weeks as the 4,773 destroyed in Aleppo over three years.This is Mosul, roughly Aleppo’s size and also more than 1½ times the area of northern Gaza. Iraqi troops, allied militias and U.S. air forces launched an offensive to retake the city from the Islamic State in late 2016.About 1½ times as many structures were damaged in northern Gaza in seven weeks as were damaged across Mosul during the nine-month battle.Nearly twice as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza as were destroyed in Mosul over those same periods.In Raqqa, Kurdish fighters backed by the U.S.-led coalition fought to defeat the Islamic State in 2017.More than 2½ times as many structures were damaged in northern Gaza in seven weeks as were damaged in Raqqa during eight months of strikes.More than three times as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza as were destroyed in Raqqa over those same periods.Soon after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Israeli military leaders signaled their intent to retaliate with widespread devastation.On Oct. 10, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops he had “released all the restraints” and that “Gaza will never return to what it was.” The same day, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said that “while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage.”In a little over two months, Israeli air forces fired more than 29,000 air-to-ground munitions, 40 to 45 percent of which were unguided, according to a recent assessment from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The bombing rate has been about 2½ times as high as the peak of the U.S.-led coalition’s effort to defeat the Islamic State, which at its height fired 5,075 air-to-ground munitions across both Iraq and Syria in one month, according to data from the research and advocacy group Airwars.— Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee of the Red CrossOne hallmark of the 21st century’s most indiscriminate air campaigns, as in Syria and Ukraine, has been the bombing of hospitals, which cannot be attacked under the laws of war unless they are actively being used to “commit acts harmful to the enemy.”The Israeli military made no secret of its view that Gaza’s hospitals were military targets.“Hamas systematically exploits hospitals as a key part of its war machine,” Hagari, the military spokesman, said on Nov. 5. “We will not accept Hamas’s cynical use of hospitals to hide their terror infrastructure.”By Dec. 14, Israeli bombardment and fighting had forced the closure of more than two-thirds of the 28 hospitals identified by The Post in northern Gaza.As Israel’s military campaign went on, satellite imagery reviewed by The Post showed how heavy strikes around Gaza’s hospitals destroyed entire neighborhoods, wrecked infrastructure and displaced civilians, often making it impossible for hospitals to function.To assess destruction around hospitals, The Post analyzed U.N. Satellite Center data in areas within 180 meters (about 590 feet) — the distance at which the smallest commonly used bombs, weighing 250 pounds, can cause enough damage to make a building uninhabitable, and the largest, weighing 2,000 pounds, can damage a structure beyond repair, according to a report by Armament Research Services commissioned by the International Committee of the Red Cross.The data showed that Israel’s bombardment and other fighting had damaged structures within 180 meters of all of northern Gaza’s 28 hospitals.\n\nAcross northern Gaza, visual evidence and other accounts showed how Israeli forces shot at, bombed, besieged and raided hospitals.The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, Gaza’s only cancer treatment center, shut down on Nov. 1 after nearby airstrikes. At least four cancer patients died afterward, according to the Health Ministry. Al-Rantisi Hospital, the only hospital with a pediatric cancer ward, evacuated on Nov. 10 along with three nearby hospitals after being struck on Nov. 5 and surrounded by Israeli troops days later. Four premature babies left behind on breathing machines at one of the hospitals would later be found dead.Video shot by a journalist in the parking lot of al-Awda Hospital showed nearby strikes filling the air with dust and smoke and raining debris down on ambulances.Debris falls and fire explodes after an airstrike hits near al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, video posted to Instagram on Nov. 10 shows.\n\n(Feras al-Ajrami/Instagram)The Indonesian Hospital evacuated on Nov. 22, three days after artillery fire struck the hospital and killed 12 people. Israeli raids on Kamal Adwan Hospital over several days in mid-December resulted in the hospital’s “effective destruction” and the death of at least eight patients, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted on Dec. 17.In Gaza City, Israeli strikes destroyed much of the neighborhood surrounding al-Quds Hospital, operated by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Israeli forces pushing toward the center of the city fought with Hamas in the vicinity, and videos posted by the PRCS showed the impact of heavy nearby strikes. On Nov. 12, the hospital ceased operating.“What we have been witnessing is a campaign that was planned. It was a plan, definitely, to close down all the hospitals in the north,” said Léo Cans, head of mission for Palestine with Doctors Without Borders.There have been 239 attacks on health-care workers, vehicles and facilities in Gaza that have killed 570 people since the war started, the WHO said on Dec. 13.The IDF has published videos and images that show weapons and other military items, which it said were found in multiple hospitals. Underneath al-Shifa Hospital, Israeli troops excavated a tunnel with multiple empty rooms, alleging that they had been used by Hamas. The military said Hamas fighters there and elsewhere had fled before Israeli troops arrived and taken materiel with them. None of the evidence was possible to verify independently, because Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza except on strictly guided tours.“What we have been witnessing is a campaign that was planned.”— Léo Cans, head of mission for Palestine with Doctors Without Borders“Only the current misuse of the hospital deprives it of its protection, but if that misuse ends, that protection is restored,” said Adil Haque, an international law expert and Rutgers University professor. If there were a tunnel or underground structure beneath the hospital, and troops weren’t sure what was inside them, any doubts should “caution in favor of restraint,” he added.The satellite imagery reviewed by The Post revealed other evidence of how hospitals had come under attack: large craters close to hospitals, many of them bearing the telltale characteristics of large, airdropped bombs.The Post reviewed nearly 100 satellite images taken between Oct. 8 and Dec. 10 and found about three dozen apparent craters within 180 meters of 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza. At The Post’s request, five satellite imagery analysts reviewed images of each crater large enough to suggest the use of a bomb weighing 2,000 pounds or more. While The Post’s findings represent a conservative undercount of the actual number of bombs dropped near Gaza’s hospitals, the imagery shows that hardly a hospital in the north has been left untouched.Ten large craters identified by The Post near hospitals suggested the use of bombs weighing 2,000 pounds, the largest in regular use.The large craters were seen near eight hospitals, more than a quarter of all the hospitals in northern Gaza. Bombs in larger weight classes have larger blast radiuses and are more likely to inflict serious damage that could put even well-built structures like hospitals permanently out of service.At these two hospitals, for example, The Post identified large craters suggesting the use of 2,000-pound bombs within 90 meters (295 feet), the distance at which a bomb of that size could completely destroy buildings within the blast radius.At al-Awda Hospital, northern Gaza’s main maternity center, a crater in the road about 90 meters from the hospital grounds suggested the use of a 2,000-pound bomb in November.On Nov. 21, a strike on the hospital itself killed three doctors, Doctors Without Borders said.At al-Karama Hospital, north of Gaza City, two craters that appeared in Oct. 15 satellite imagery suggested the use of 2,000-pound bombs.The hospital was within the 90-meter blast radiuses of both munitions.It was forced to close on Oct. 17.Officials at humanitarian and health-care organizations with lengthy experience in major conflict zones said Israel’s war in Gaza was the most devastating they had seen.Tom Potokar, a chief surgeon with the International Committee of the Red Cross working in Gaza for the 14th time, said explosive injuries were responsible for all the wounds he and his colleagues at the European Hospital in southern Gaza had been treating. Many patients had necrotic wounds requiring amputation because of the lack of supplies and equipment at battered and besieged hospitals in the north.“For me, personally, this is without a doubt the worst I’ve seen,” said Potokar, who has worked during conflicts in South Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia and Ukraine.Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal and a doctor who worked in Aleppo during the battle for the city, said he believed that “what’s happening right now in Gaza is beyond any disaster that I’ve witnessed at least in the last 15 years or so.”Sahloul estimated it will take decades to rebuild the health-care infrastructure destroyed in Gaza and the knowledge and expertise of the scores of doctors and other health-care workers who have been killed.Preliminary data provided to The Post by Airwars suggested that strikes in Gaza were killing civilians at twice the rate of the U.S.-led campaign in Raqqa. Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, said that the data they provided The Post represented “just a fraction” of the strikes they were currently researching in Gaza, which averaged about 200 strikes per week. In Airwars’s 10 years of work, Tripp said, the group had never documented more than about 250 civilian casualty strikes per month in any conflict.“Make no mistake — U.S. operations in Iraq and Syria, especially in densely populated cities like Mosul and Raqqa, caused devastating civilian harm and destruction,” said Annie Shiel, the U.S. advocacy director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “But what we are seeing in Gaza, the level of death and destruction in this relatively short period of time, is absolutely staggering in comparison. Nowhere is safe for civilians.”“For me, personally, this is without a doubt the worst I’ve seen.”— Tom Potokar, a chief surgeon with the International Committee of the Red CrossPnina Sharvit Baruch, a former high-ranking military lawyer who was responsible for advising Israeli commanders, said that Israel is currently facing “the biggest threat to its existence” from enemies determined to destroy it. Hamas made Gaza a “fortified military area” and operates from within civilian structures, she said, adding that “Hamas’s strategy of using civilians as shields means that attacking its military capabilities leads to unfortunate yet inevitable civilian casualties.” When Israeli commanders weigh civilian harm against military advantage when deciding whether to strike, she said, the “level of threat posed by Hamas [to Israel] is a legitimate component of evaluating the military advantage.”Several humanitarian workers interviewed by The Post noted that Israel’s campaign in Gaza, and its destruction of hospitals and homes, will likely create additional suffering, such as hunger, lack of shelter and the spread of communicable diseases, that could eventually kill more people than the bombs and fighting.Sahloul said he believed the only explanation for so many attacks on civilian sites, which should have been protected by the laws of war, was that such attacks were intentional.“People in Syria told me they can tolerate bombs and missiles, but if there’s no doctors in town and no hospitals, they usually leave,” he said. “So I would have to assume that if it is intentional, the goal is to force the population to leave. And when they leave, they don’t come back.”A previous version of a graphic in this article stated that Mosul's battle lasted eight months. It lasted nine months.The quality of satellite imagery, irregular coverage and even the angle of a satellite’s camera can all affect the ability to identify clear craters. In some cases, craters could be located but not conclusively attributed to a specific munition or payload size. In other cases, damage from the air campaign was clear, but craters were not visible.The Post relied on a conservative assessment of what is and is not a crater and asked multiple experts to review any crater found in within 180 meters of a hospital in northern Gaza that had diameter of at least 40 feet, or 12.1 meters. Any crater with a diameter greater than 11.7 meters found in light soil like Gaza’s, experts said, suggests a bomb weighing 2,000 pounds or more could have been used. To account for inconsistencies in measurements, The Post relied on the slightly larger, 40-foot diameter.The Post focused its analysis on this size because a 2,000-pound bomb dropped 180 meters away could damage a building beyond repair. At 90 meters, that same munition could destroy a building. Only craters that experts agreed on with high confidence were included in this report.Experts cautioned The Post against ascribing particular damage to particular craters, as the amount of damage caused by a bomb can vary widely, especially in a dense urban environment. Damage depends on nearby structures, building materials, the soil, whether a bomb has been set to explode above or below ground, and other factors. Experts also noted that even the largest munitions can be employed to ensure that nearby civilian infrastructure is not damaged or is minimally affected when they explode. But even then, large munitions have inherent characteristics that can only be mitigated to a certain degree, making collateral-damage assessments done before the munition is used key to avoiding civilian harm, they said.Louisa Loveluck in London, Claire Parker in Cairo, Jonathan Baran in San Francisco, and Cate Brown and John Hudson in Washington contributed to this report.Design and development by Junne Alcantara and Irfan Uraizee.\n\nEvan Hill is an investigative reporter at The Washington Post focused on open-source and visual forensic techniques.

  "text": "In an order read out by court president Joan E. Donoghue, the panel called on Israel to prevent the possibility of genocide in its war on Hamas, allow more aid into Gaza and sanction its officials and soldiers for comments that amount to incitement. It directed Israel to submit a report within one month outlining how it is implementing those orders.\n\n“The court found that Russia had no foundation under international law for its claims of self-defense and that it should stop waging war,” said Hebrew University law professor Yuval Shany, a former chairman of the U. N. Human Rights committee and a fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. “In this case, you might read the court’s rulings as an implicit validation that Israel does have a legitimate claim of self-defense.”\n\n“The fact that they have to take measures to prevent genocide, that is, in other words, a cease-fire,” she said. “There are going to be a lot of eyes on this ICJ opinion. I don’t think Israel is going to be able to just slide by like they usually do.”\n\nThe case brought by South Africa has spotlighted deep divisions over the Israeli campaign in Gaza and the way it’s being conducted. In a hearing this month, South Africa argued that Israel had violated the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by both committing and failing to prevent genocidal acts. It asked the court to order Israel to cease military operations there immediately.\n\n“This is definitely a ‘win’ for South Africa, although there won’t be enormous immediate change on the ground,” Juliette McIntyre, a lecturer in law at the University of South Australia who specializes in international courts and tribunals, wrote in an email. “Which means some will criticize the court for not going far enough.”\n\n“It is becoming ever clearer that huge swaths of Gaza — entire towns, villages, refugee camps — are being wiped from the map,” Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, an Irish lawyer on the South African team, said at the hearing. “On average, 247 Palestinians are being killed and are at risk of being killed each day, many of them literally blown to pieces. They include 48 mothers each day, two every hour. And over 117 children each day.”",

  "text": "JERUSALEM — Hamas released two American hostages on Friday, U. S. and Israeli officials said, the first of the at least 200 captives the militant group has held since it rampaged through Israeli towns two weeks ago.The mother and daughter, released to the Red Cross in Gaza, were transferred to an Israeli military team and escorted to an army base in Israel to be reunited with their family members, officials said.\n\nThe pair, identified as Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie Raanan, of Evanston, Ill., were in Israel to visit family when they were kidnapped from Nahal Oz, a kibbutz not far from the border fence breached by Hamas fighters. The group said it released them at the request of Qatari mediators for “humanitarian reasons.”\n\nUntil Friday, Hamas had ignored demands from Israel and pleas from Western governments to free the captives, many of whom are children, ill or elderly. Israel has said it would not allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza through its territory until the hostages were freed. Human rights groups have said taking civilian hostages is an unambiguous war crime. President Biden has called Hamas’s actions “pure evil.”\n\nBiden, who asked Congress on Friday to authorize a sweeping aid package for Israel, said U. S. officials and their allies were “working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas.” He pledged to continue pushing for the release of all still being held.\n\n“Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nInside the Palestinian enclave, a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding: Nearly 2 million people have been cut off from food, water, fuel and medicine as they weather a relentless Israeli bombing campaign. Hospitals faced with dire shortages were on “the brink of collapse,” the United Nations reported.\n\nBiden, who said this week that Israel and Egypt had assured him they would allow the aid trucks to pass, announced Friday that the crossing would open “in the next 24 to 48 hours.”\n\nElsewhere along the border, the Israeli military was massing troops and armored vehicles in preparation for the anticipated ground invasion of the densely populated territory. The operation would involve heavy urban combat and almost certainly would lead to an escalation in civilian casualties, analysts said.\n\nAs Israel prepared for a ground war, and besieged bystanders braced for its likely consequences, Amnesty International said it had found “damning evidence” of Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Amnesty investigators said Israeli attacks have destroyed block after block of residential buildings and critical infrastructure and caused “mass civilian casualties.”\n\nFrom Egypt to Indonesia and in several American cities, demonstrators again took to the streets, shouting down Israel and its allies, especially the United States, and demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed 4,137 people in Gaza and wounded more than 13,200, Palestinian officials say. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli officials say. Hamas, rampaging through villages and kibbutz settlements, took more than 200 people hostage.\n\nTen Americans remained unaccounted for, Blinken said, and authorities knew that Hamas was holding at least some of them hostage. Diplomats were working feverishly to secure their release, Blinken said. He declined to share further details.\n\nThe Raanans’ release spurred more urgent calls for the remaining hostages to be set free. The Hostages and Missing Families forum, a group in Israel, sought to pressure Arab leaders in the region to work to return their loved ones safely.\n\nA spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli authorities “will continue to operate with the best of their abilities and efforts in order to locate all of the missing and return all of the abductees home.”",

  "text": "JERUSALEM — Sasha Ariel was watching the news Friday night — as she has done almost constantly since her sister Karina was kidnapped by Hamas militants Oct. 7 — when she finally heard the alert she’d been praying for: Hamas was releasing two hostages. For a few moments, she dared to hope it was Karina about to walk free from the nightmare that has engulfed her family, her country and the Gaza Strip, where hostages and civilians alike are enduring a withering bombardment.\n\nThe day after being briefly electrified by Hamas’s surprise release — after the group steadfastly ignored demands from around the world to free at least the children, ill and aged — hostage families agonized Saturday over what the gesture might mean.\n\nGovernment negotiators, military planners and aid groups are also trying to understand what Hamas hoped to achieve, and whether the dynamic of the war has shifted, including the calculus by the Israeli military for an expected ground invasion of Gaza.\n\nSince the Hamas rampage killed more than 1,400 Israelis, Israel has maintained a punishing air assault on Gaza targets. Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes have killed at least 4,385 people in Gaza and displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians. The Israel Defense Forces continues to amass huge forces along the border.\n\nMany are skeptical that the release of two captives — out of more than 200 — will make much difference. Michael Milshtein observed and negotiated with Hamas leaders for years as the head of the Israeli military’s Palestinian Intelligence Department. He said the group may be bidding to slow or limit Israel’s expected ground assault by hinting at a new openness to negotiations.\n\n“It was new development; maybe it opens a new opportunity,” said Milshtein, who is now the head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University. “But I don’t think it will change policies or plans. People are determined to eradicate Hamas from the map.”\n\nHamas said it released the mother and daughter pair — Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie Raanan, of Evanston, Ill. — for “humanitarian” reasons at the behest of Qatar, which has been a pipeline for aid and diplomatic support to Gaza for more than a decade. Hamas also said it was attempting to undercut President Biden’s portrayal of the group as a depraved terrorist organization engaged in “pure evil.”\n\nFollowing the release, a Hamas communiqué said it was open to freeing other “individuals of foreign nationalities … when security circumstances permit.” The statement gave no further details but appeared to suggest that it was linking possible hostage releases to an easing of Israeli’s military campaign.\n\nInside Gaza, desperate civilians didn’t have much time to debate the possible meaning of the hostage release. Almost 1.5 million people have been displaced by Israeli bombing, according to the United Nations. Nearly 2 million have been cut off from food, water, fuel and medicine.\n\nSome Gazans wondered if Saturday’s modest delivery was part of a deal with Hamas to free the two women. If so, few expected the release to do anything to stem the bombardment that has left many sleeping on the roads.\n\n“It might help get aid into Gaza from Rafah, but never a cease-fire or an end of the war,” said Ayman Jameel, 39, who was charging 10 cellphones at pharmacy in Nuseirat refugee camp in southern Gaza. “Hamas has dozens of Israelis, and two will not make a change.”\n\nNeither Hamas or Qatar have described any of the terms that may have been agreed to for the women’s release. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment on what role Israel had in brokering the arrangement.\n\nU. S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate negotiations, described the arrangement to release the women as a major breakthrough aided by teams from the State Department and FBI. Freeing the rest of an unknown number of Americans would be even more complicated, they said, particularly if ground fighting begins.\n\nIn Israel, the families of all but two of the hostages resumed their vigil Saturday as well as their campaign to pressure the Israeli government to get the rest of them out.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an alliance of families, planned demonstrations Saturday. The group called for Israelis across the country go out to balconies and sidewalks at 8 p.m. and light candles in a show of support. El Al, the national airline, said it would join with special illuminated video screens.\n\nThe family group hailed the release of the Raanans, who were in Israel to celebrate the Sukkot holiday with their family. But it called on Israel, Qatar and the world to do more for the rest.\n\nAriel, whose sister was taken from a military base near Gaza, said she woke up to the same awful waiting Saturday. The only good news was the report of the first aid trucks into Gaza, she said.",

  "text": "JERUSALEM — Facing growing calls for a new hostage release deal and a clear strategy for postwar Gaza — on the outs with the Israeli public, squeezed by his own government and increasingly at odds with Washington — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself in deep political peril. But you wouldn’t have known it as he stepped to the lectern Wednesday night to tout his new mantra of “total victory” in Gaza — projecting the same confidence that has carried him through six terms, 16 years and countless scandals as the country’s longest-serving leader.\n\nThe challenges for Netanyahu are abundant, forming a circle that is seemingly impossible to square: His ultranationalist, far-right coalition partners are threatening to bring down the government if there is any letup in the war. He also faces intense pressure from the families of Israeli hostages — and from within his own war cabinet — to secure a pause in the fighting and the release of those still held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, is pushing for a political framework for postwar Gaza that includes a road map for the creation of a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu has spent his political career trying to thwart. “I’m proud that I prevented the establishment of a Palestinian state,” he said in December, adding that the U. S.-brokered Oslo accords had been a “a fateful mistake.”\n\n“It’s never been worse for him if we compare it to the two or three decades of him being at the helm of Israeli politics,” Plesner said.\n\nNetanyahu is widely blamed here for the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, the bloodiest day in the nation’s history, after years of touting his security credentials. He has repeatedly refused to answer questions about the security failures that day, saying there would be time for them after the war.\n\n“A reckless deal = the dismantlement of the government,” Ben Gvir posted on X last week as reports circulated of a new hostage release deal. While opposition leader Yair Lapid then offered a “safety net” — saying he would step in and shore up the coalition if Ben Gvir were to withdraw — it would not give Netanyahu the political longevity he seeks. Analysts say Lapid probably would only protect Netanyahu from a no-confidence vote for a limited period as a deal is done.\n\nIn his speech Wednesday, he vowed again to push on until “total victory” — a slogan spotted recently on the hat of one of his campaign managers. While Israeli military leaders have quietly acknowledged that the war will weaken Hamas but not destroy the group, the prime minister continues to promise that “the day after [the war] is the day after Hamas.”\n\nDahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli pollster and political analyst, said Netanyahu is “selling a false image to the Israeli public that you can have it all,” including his assurance that increased military pressure will bring the hostages home sooner — even as family members and former captives warn their time is running out.\n\nNetanyahu added that the military campaign would continue for “several months” and would focus next on Rafah, along the Egyptian border, where more than a million displaced Palestinians have fled for safety — another point of friction with Washington.\n\n“It will be easier to convince the coalition partners to support a deal if it comes with a great prize,” he said. “He’ll tell them, what is 800 freed terrorists compared to peace with Saudi Arabia? He’s very skillful politically and can try and revive himself through this opportunity.”\n\nEven paying lip service to a Palestinian state is not an option, Zohar said: “He will need to refuse that demand by the Americans, and he has succeeded in doing that until now.”\n\nNetanyahu is an expert at buying time and running out the clock. He knows Washington will soon be consumed by a new election cycle. And while the majority of Israelis want new elections, most believe that can’t happen until the war is over.\n\n“At the end of the day, public opinion polls don’t bring about an election; only a vote in the Knesset does,” said Plesner. “For an early election to happen, at least five members of Netanyahu’s coalition in the Knesset would need to join the opposition.",

  "text": "It was unclear whether Netanyahu was referring to the Hamas response to a broad hostage release framework negotiated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt last month in Paris, and delivered to Qatar on Tuesday, or to the framework itself. “By giving in to Hamas demands, we will only invite another massacre,” Netanyahu said, adding that Israel would continue its military campaign in southern Gaza.\n\nOn his fifth trip to the region since the Israel-Hamas war began, Blinken also stopped in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the West Bank for discussions about what happens when the war ends, including a firm path and timetable for establishing a Palestinian state. But his primary goal in Israel, U. S. officials said, was to make progress on the hostage release proposal and address the worsening humanitarian crisis inside Gaza.\n\nUnder the framework agreement that negotiators presented to Hamas and Israel, an initial pause in fighting would last for six weeks and bring about the release of all civilian hostages held by the militant group in Gaza. In return, Israel would release three Palestinian prisoners for every hostage Hamas frees and take steps to allow more humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza.\n\nThe text of Hamas’s response was published by the Hezbollah-aligned al-Akhbar newspaper Wednesday and verified to The Washington Post by several Hamas officials. Following the basic lines of the framework, it envisions three phases, each lasting 45 days, involving waves of releases of Israeli hostages and the bodies of the dead. During this period, Israeli troops would “reposition” away from populated areas in Gaza.\n\nThe Hamas response had other requirements: that at least 500 trucks of humanitarian aid should enter Gaza each day, compared with the current rate of 100-200; displaced Gazans could return to their homes and move around the enclave freely; Israel would allow more wounded Palestinians to seek medical treatment abroad; roads should be fixed and rubble from Israeli attacks cleared; and housing and hospitals should be repaired, and shelters built. The Hamas document also calls for the end of all “incursions” and “aggression” by Israeli settlers against Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa Mosque, a compound known by Israelis as Temple Mount.\n\nAbout 100 hostages are believed to still be alive, and Israeli officials say Hamas is holding at least 31 bodies. The “vast majority” of the dead were killed during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel, according to a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. During a previous pause in the fighting in November, 105 hostages — 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals — were released in exchange for more than 200 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nMore than 1.2 million Palestinians are crammed into the city in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt, most of them displaced several times from fighting farther north. Many are living in unsanitary conditions in tents or makeshift structures, struggling to find food or receive medical treatment. Aid groups have warned a famine is looming. Israel intensified its bombing of Rafah this week, with five attacks killing 12 people in the area on Tuesday alone.\n\nHamas has “dehumanized” the hostages it took in that attack, he said. “But that cannot be a license to dehumanize others when the people of Gaza have nothing to do with the attacks. ... We cannot and must not lose sight of our common humanity.”\n\nTop U. N. officials, as well as many governments around the world, have called for a cease-fire, warning that a catastrophic humanitarian situation is worsening by the day. Tor Wennesland, the top U.N. official for the Middle East peace process, told reporters in New York on Wednesday that an Israeli military operation in Rafah would be “completely catastrophic” to the civilians there, as well as to the flow of humanitarian aid.",

  "text": "The Israelis have not put forward a “hard deadline” for when they will step up their military campaign against Hezbollah, a senior U. S. official told The Washington Post, but he acknowledged that the window for negotiations is narrowing. Like others in this piece, the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive and ongoing talks.\n\nWhite House envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut last week to pass on Israel’s proposal for a preliminary solution to the conflict. The proposal, as described by Lebanese officials and the Western diplomat, calls for Hezbollah to withdraw its troops a few miles north and for the Lebanese army to increase its presence in the area, creating a de facto buffer zone between the militants and the Israeli border.\n\nA border deal would, in theory, allow some 70,000 displaced Israelis to return to their homes in the north — a priority for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is widely blamed in Israel for failing to prevent the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 and not doing more to support those whose lives have been upended by the conflict. Tens of thousands have been displaced in Lebanon, too, and authorities in Beirut will need a deal they can sell to a weary public.\n\nMany Hezbollah fighters hail from the south and the group has long held sway there. Under the terms of the resolution, its soldiers would retreat north of the river and “weapons would be put away again,” according to an official close to Hezbollah, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with rules set by the group.\n\nLebanon can carry out negotiations with Israel on border demarcation before a cease-fire in Gaza, according to an official with knowledge of the talks, since that condition was set by Hezbollah, not the government. But an acceptable deal has to come “in a package,” not piecemeal, the official added, and would need to be approved by Hezbollah.\n\n“I don’t know when the war in the north will happen, but the likelihood that it will happen in the upcoming months is higher than before,” Israel’s army chief, Herzi Halevi, told soldiers during a visit to the north Wednesday. “When we have to, we will go forward with all our strength.”",

  "text": "“The Philadelphi Corridor — or, to put it more correctly, the southern stoppage point [of Gaza] — must be in our hands. It must be shut,” Netanyahu said in late December, referring to a buffer road along the border. “It is clear that any other arrangement would not ensure the demilitarization that we seek.”\n\nBefore Oct. 7, Egyptian and Hamas border authorities each managed their respective sides of the Rafah crossing, which sits along the Philadelphi Corridor, a no man’s land approximately nine miles long and several hundred yards wide that stretches from the southernmost tip of Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea. Israel hasn’t had boots on the ground along the border since 2005, when the country withdrew its forces from the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael’s war in Gaza — launched after militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage on Oct. 7 — has leveled much of the north and killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\n“You must take control over this corridor, including Rafah border crossing,” Milshtein said. “Otherwise, it means that if there will be a cease-fire or even a broader settlement in Gaza, and the whole border will still be open, Hamas will very quickly get everything this organization needs from the military point of view” and reconstitute itself.\n\nBut the idea of Israeli troops returning to the border has set off alarm bells in Cairo, which said in recent weeks that such a move would risk undermining the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty — a landmark accord that led to a half-century of coexistence and cooperation between the once-bitter foes.\n\n“There is lack of trust or lack of understanding from both sides, which we are not used to,” said a former member of Egypt’s parliament, Mohamed Anwar Sadat, the nephew of Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president who signed the 1979 treaty and was later assassinated. “Honestly, we believe we are back to square one when it comes to our relationship with Israel — back to the ’70s.”\n\nSince President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi took power after a military coup in 2013, Egypt has destroyed hundreds of tunnels used to smuggle weapons and goods to and from Gaza. The government also displaced tens of thousands of northern Sinai residents and razed buildings near the border to create a militarized buffer zone about three miles deep.\n\nThe suggestion from Israel that Egypt has failed to adequately crack down on smuggling has touched a nerve among Egyptian officials, for whom security is paramount. From Cairo’s perspective, Sisi has already taken on significant political risk by shoring up Israel’s blockade of Gaza, even as more than a million displaced Palestinians seek safety in Rafah.\n\nRashwan, the state information head, laid out a lengthy defense of Egypt’s efforts to crack down on smuggling — pointing, among other measures, to a 20-foot-deep concrete wall Egypt constructed along the border in recent years. And he lashed out at suggestions from Israel that militants are co-opting humanitarian deliveries for their own purposes.\n\nTensions between the countries were already high after calls by right-wing Israeli lawmakers for the displacement of Gazans into Sinai, a nightmare scenario for Egypt. The war in Gaza has also dealt another blow to Egypt’s struggling economy: Tourism revenue is down, and income from shipping through the Suez Canal dropped after Houthi militants in Yemen began attacking merchant vessels in the Red Sea to protest the war.\n\n“The strain being imposed on Egypt right now is just extraordinary,” said Mirette Mabrouk, director of the Egypt studies program at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. “The security of Egypt is tantamount to the security of Israel, so when you continue to attempt to destabilize Egypt, or if you proceed in a manner that is very likely to destabilize Egypt, it is not in your interest.”\n\nIsraeli troops along the border would be likely to become targets for Hamas or allied militants, bringing the violence right to Egypt’s doorstep and standing in the way of a durable peace, said a former Arab diplomat familiar with Cairo’s concerns, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue.\n\nIsrael’s seizure of the border crossing would also sever Egypt’s geographic link to Gaza, potentially undercutting Egypt’s leverage with Hamas and weakening its role as a mediator between Israeli and Palestinian authorities, the diplomat added. Egypt, along with Qatar and the United States, continues to play a key role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a potential cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages.",

  "text": "BAGHDAD — A U. S. airstrike in Baghdad on Wednesday killed a militia commander suspected of plotting attacks on American troops throughout the region, officials said, drawing swift denunciation from the Iraqi military and intensifying calls for ending its partnership with Washington.Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.The operation targeted a key figure in an Iranian-backed group, Kataib Hezbollah, which the Biden administration has blamed for scores of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since October, officials said in a statement. American positions have been hit with drones, rockets or missiles at least 168 times in that span. An attack that killed three Army reservists last week in Jordan was the first in this stretch of violence to turn deadly.\n\nU. S. military officials said Wednesday’s strike was carried out about 9:30 p.m. “in response to the attacks on U.S. service members” and resulted in the death of a militia commander “responsible for directly planning and participating” in those attacks. The statement, which does not identify the individual who was killed, said there were no initial indications of civilian casualties.\n\nIt follows a wave of American airstrikes Friday night in Iraq and Syria aimed at 85 targets associated with the militias. President Biden said then that retaliation for the killing of U. S. soldiers “began today” and would “continue at times and places of our choosing.”\n\nIraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group that includes Kataib Hezbollah and other militia groups affiliated with Iran, announced Wednesday the death of Abu Baqir al-Saedi, a senior leader affiliated with the organization. Kataib Hezbollah posted a picture of Saedi online along with images of a vehicle that was struck.\n\n“We swear we won’t be silent,” text accompanying one image read. The group reiterated its demand for an end to the “U. S. occupation.” U.S. forces are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, but the two sides began formal talks in January aimed at winding down the presence of U.S.-led coalition troops in the country.\n\n“This violation will not be the last if there is no strict and firm official position from the Iraqi government,” the group said. “These crimes will not go unpunished.”\n\nThe U. S. military carried out an airstrike in Baghdad on Jan. 4 against Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, killing its deputy commander of operations in the Baghdad region, Mushtaq Talib al-Saidi, also known as Abu Taqwa.\n\nLoud booms were heard across the capital again on Wednesday night. The Iraqi military later announced that a civilian car had been targeted in the Mashtal neighborhood in eastern Baghdad, killing all of its occupants. Crowds later gathered around the blackened vehicle, a Jeep, and at one point security officers removed a body from underneath the car.\n\nAfter the United States claimed responsibility for the killing, an Iraqi military spokesman called the strike “a clear aggression and violation of Iraqi sovereignty.” Iraq would “hold the American side and the coalition forces responsible for the repercussions of these dangerous actions that threaten the security and safety of the country,” the spokesman, Maj. Gen. Tahseen Al Khafaji, said in a statement.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani had condemned the previous round of U. S. strikes targeting the militias that are part of Iraq’s security services. Sudani, who visited wounded militia members in the hospital, has also warned that Iraq should not serve as a stage for the conflict between Iran and the United States.\n\nMilitias organized under the Islamic Resistance in Iraq have framed their attacks on U. S. personnel as a protest of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and American support for it. But leaders of Kata’ib Hezbollah pledged on Jan. 30 to suspend its attacks “in order to prevent embarrassment of the Iraqi government.”\n\nSabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said during a news briefing Tuesday that U. S. officials know the recent attacks on American personnel bear “the fingerprints of KH” and similar groups, and that they will be held responsible.\n\nAdministration officials have said they will take all necessary measures to protect U. S. troops. On Sunday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby implored the Iraqi government to “move with more alacrity” in addressing the threats posed to roughly 3,500 American military personnel who are based in the country and neighboring Syria.\n\n“Three Americans were killed, three troops; three families now are grieving,” Kirby told Fox News, referencing the Jan. 28 attack in Jordan. “The president’s not going to sit back and idly just take that. We’re going to respond.”\n\nThe Biden administration has opted for a strategy that falls short of holding Tehran itself accountable for supporting militant groups in the region, said Jonathan Lord, director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security. Rather, he said, the U. S. approach to striking targets in Iraq appears to seek a balance between upsetting its partners and its adversaries.",

  "text": "As the tally of attacks on U. S. personnel in Iraq and Syria has surged to more than 160 since October, the Pentagon has carried out retaliatory strikes against Iranian proxies there. But to the frustration of many in Washington, those actions, along with a parallel campaign of strikes on Iranian-linked rebels in Yemen, have failed to end the violence, and the president’s critics used the incident Sunday to ramp up their demands for more aggressive countermeasures.\n\nJordan’s government condemned the attack and said Jordanian troops had suffered no casualties. Government spokesman Muhannad Mubaideen said Jordan would “continue to counter terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and weapons across the Syrian border into Jordan, and will confront with firmness and determination anyone who attempts to attack the security of the Kingdom.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear where the attack originated, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the incident. Military commanders are working to determine that information and, crucially, why U. S. air defenses failed to intercept the drone.\n\nEight service members required evacuation out of Jordan for “higher level care, but they are in stable condition,” U. S. Central Command said in a statement Sunday night. The identities of those slain were not disclosed pending family notifications. Biden, in his statement, called them “patriots in the highest sense.”\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group for Iranian-linked militias including Kataib Hezbollah and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a senior official with the organization, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with rules set by the group.\n\n“If the U. S. keeps supporting Israel, there will be escalations,” the Islamic Resistance in Iraq official said. “All U.S. interests in the region are legitimate targets, and we don’t care about U.S. threats to respond. … Martyrdom is our prize.”\n\nFriction between the two countries has worsened in recent weeks, as U. S. forces have fought back against the rise in Iranian proxy attacks. On Jan. 4, the Biden administration launched a rare retaliatory strike on a base belonging to a militia in central Baghdad, killing the group’s commander. U.S. officials said at the time that it was hoped the strike would serve as a deterrent against further hostility toward U.S. troops. Instead, the attacks have grown more ambitious.\n\nTower 22 is part of a constellation of bases that house some 2,500 U. S. troops in Iraq and another 900 in Syria. Those forces have been focused chiefly on preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State, the terrorist network that took over large swaths of both countries until a U.S.-led military campaign left the group decimated.\n\nTower 22 functions as a support site for another U. S. outpost across Jordan’s border in Syria that has taken on a different sort of mission. The isolated Tanf base, located along a key highway that connects Tehran to its ally, Damascus, has served as a platform for U.S. forces pushing back against Iran’s efforts to supply partners and proxies in Syria and beyond.\n\nSunday’s bloodshed also spotlights Jordan’s attempt to walk a tenuous line as many in the Arab world, outraged by Israel’s punishing assault on Gaza, have faulted the United States for its unconditional backing of the Jewish state despite the war’s enormous civilian toll. The kingdom views the United States as a valuable partner in counterterrorism but also is seeking to avoid the wrath of Iran and other regional neighbors.\n\n“But it’s still not perfect, and you’re not going to be able to attain perfection in these defensive efforts, which is why the tragedy today happened,” he said.\n\nIran hawks in Congress amplified their criticism of Biden and his management of the Gaza-related violence in the wake of the new bloodshed. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) implored the administration to impose “serious crippling costs” on Iran and its proxies.",

  "text": "Israel’s military said Marman and Har were both in “good medical condition.” They were transported via military helicopters to Sheba Tel Hashomer Medical Center in Israel, where the medical staff said their condition was “stable” and where they were reunited with their families.\n\n“I salute our brave warriors for the bold action that led to their liberation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. “Only the continuation of military pressure until complete victory will result in the release of all our abductees. We will not miss any opportunity to bring them home.”\n\nArmed Hamas militants were guarding the men and were also spread throughout the building, he said. A minute later, he said, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes; Israeli soldiers shielded the hostages with their bodies as other troops exchanged heavy fire with Hamas fighters.\n\nNetanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were with Israel’s military chief as the raid unfolded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting, the military said. In a visit Monday with the unit that carried out the operation, Netanyahu called it “one of the most successful rescue raids in the history of Israel. … A perfect operation that was perfectly executed.”\n\nIt was only the second successful rescue mission since the start of the ground incursion into Gaza in late October — on Oct. 30, the IDF rescued a female hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, in addition to 29 others who are believed to be dead, most of them killed during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMany of the families of the hostages and the thousands of Israelis who have joined them in street protests have called on the government to agree to a deal with Hamas to exchange hostages for prisoners, believing it is the only way to guarantee the safety of their loved ones and questioning whether military operations are a realistic strategy on a larger scale.\n\n“We commend the IDF soldiers who demonstrated strength and bravery to secure the release of the two hostages, and wish them all to return home safely and speedily,” said a statement Monday by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing most of the families.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei lauded the rescue operation Monday morning and said in a social media post that in a meeting with Netanyahu last week in Jerusalem, he requested “the release of every one of the Argentine hostages” and continued to “maintain his condemnation of Hamas terrorism.”\n\nThe operation came hours after Netanyahu spoke on the phone with President Biden, who warned that an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah without appropriate accommodations for the civilian population would be seen as unacceptable to the United States, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nOn Monday, it remained unclear how the rescue — lasting about an hour and limited in its scope — would affect Israel’s broader plans for a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, where it says Hamas’s top leaders are hiding, using the remaining hostages as shields.\n\nEgypt has reinforced its border, signaling that it would not accept an exodus of refugees fleeing the fighting. It has warned that an Israeli invasion of the area along its border could endanger the countries’ 1979 peace treaty that has for decades stabilized the region.\n\nThe rescue operation was carried out amid negotiations to return the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as a halt in the fighting. Senior American, Egyptian and Qatari officials are expected to convene in Cairo on Tuesday; it is still unclear if Israel will send a delegation.\n\nDavid Tsur, former head of Yamam, the special counterterrorism unit that was among the agencies involved in the overnight mission, said that because the talks have been so far unsuccessful, the Israeli army took advantage of the “very short window of opportunity” to free the hostages. But he said it will have consequences for future operations.",

  "text": "Amid a spiraling crisis in Gaza, where deadly Israeli strikes have forced more than 1 million residents from their homes, one key U. N. agency in the enclave has been working — and now struggling — to protect and support civilians.The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, warned that it is no longer able to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza. “We are on the verge of collapse,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Sunday.\n\n“Gaza is being strangled and it seems that the world right now has lost its humanity,” the agency’s commissioner general said. The Israeli siege of the enclave has sapped its essential resources, Lazzarini said, adding that “not one drop of water, not one grain of wheat, not a liter of fuel” has been allowed into the Gaza Strip for more than a week. Without those supplies, the agency cannot continue its operations, he said.\n\nAlmost 2,700 people have been killed in Gaza, and about 9,600 have been injured in Israeli strikes, following the deadly Oct. 7 rampage by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. In Gaza, nearly a million have been displaced — with 400,000 sheltering in overwhelmed and ill-equipped UNRWA school buildings, the agency said.\n\nThe agency has specific eligibility guidelines for who can register: A person whose “normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.”\n\nThe descendants of male Palestinian refugees are also eligible, according to the agency’s website, which says about 5.9 million Palestinians are eligible for its services. UNRWA aid and services are available in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon. There are about 2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 3 million in the West Bank, according to a 2022 U. S. estimate.\n\nMost of the funding for UNRWA comes from “voluntary contributions” from U. N. member states, with a small portion of its financing coming from the U.N.’s regular budget. Its mandate has been repeatedly renewed “in the absence of a solution to the Palestine refugee problem,” it says. The U.N. renewed the mandate in December until June 2026.\n\nThe schools aim to ensure students become “confident, innovative, questioning, thoughtful, and open-minded, to uphold human values and tolerance, proud of their Palestinian identity and contributing positively to the development of society and the global community,” the agency says.\n\nSince the conflict broke out, at least 400,000 displaced people in Gaza are now sheltering in UNRWA schools and buildings, Lazzarini said in a statement Sunday, adding that the buildings are not equipped as emergency shelters. “We have reports in our logistics base, for example, where hundreds of people are just sharing one toilet,” he said.\n\nThe way the siege in Gaza is being imposed by Israel is “nothing else than collective punishment,” he said, criticizing the bombing of civilian infrastructure in densely populated areas and the lack of access to essential resources such as fuel, food, electricity and water in Gaza.\n\nThe agency said in a Saturday statement that its shelters in Gaza were “no longer safe.” It called on Israel to “protect all civilians sheltering in UNRWA premises across the Gaza Strip,” including in northern Gaza, where Israel’s military has told more than a million Palestinians to evacuate south — though doing so has proved difficult and dangerous for many.\n\nUNRWA said that many Gazans “will not be able to flee the area,” particularly women, children, and the elderly and disabled. “They have no choice and must be protected at all times,” it added.\n\nLazzarini said that the agency has lost 14 staff members in the conflict, including teachers, engineers, guards, psychologists, an engineer and a gynecologist. More than 13,000 staff members were displaced, and the team relocated to Rafah, in southern Gaza, after the evacuation directive.",

  "text": "Deaths from gun violence, after remaining relatively stable from 1999 to 2014, have spiked in recent years, to a peak of 48,830 in 2021, according to data maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But has gun violence become so horrific that it is now the leading cause of death for children?\n\nThe Biden White House, in various venues, has made that claim. But the source cited in the White House news release — a 2022 study by the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins University — reports data with a broader focus. It cites gun deaths of “children and teens,” meaning it includes deaths of 18- and 19-year-olds, who are legally considered adults in most states.\n\nWhen you focus only on children — 17 and younger — motor vehicle deaths (broadly defined) still rank No. 1, as they have for six decades, though the gap is rapidly closing. Indeed, deaths of children from gun violence have increased about 50 percent from 2019 to 2021, the CDC data shows. During the coronavirus pandemic, there was a surge in firearm sales and an increase in the use of firearms in deaths by suicide — especially among children in rural areas.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, for grant applications, defines a child as “an individual under the age of 18 years.” The European Union has a similar definition. The United Nations, in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, says “a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years.”\n\nAll but three states set the age of majority at 18. Alabama and Nebraska set it at 19, while Mississippi sets it at 21. In the United States, one earns the right to vote and the right to join the military at the age of 18.\n\nFor the purposes of this fact check, the fact that in more than half the states people as young as 18 can purchase firearms is significant, because access to firearms increases the risk of violence. Six years ago this month, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at a high school in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people. He legally bought a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 semiautomatic rifle from a licensed dealer a few miles from the school.\n\nBesides deciding whether to include 18- and 19-year-olds, there are various ways to crunch the numbers on the CDC’s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), which can alter the results. To keep it simple, because we are focusing on recent years, we will use raw numbers. A death rate (such as per 100,000 people) is preferable for examining trends over time because the U. S. population continues to grow.\n\nExcluding children under the age of 1. The Johns Hopkins study cited by the White House, which was updated in 2023, and another often-cited study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2022 and updating a previous study, do not include children under 1 because they have perinatal deaths and congenital anomalies — unique, age-specific death risks. This decision marginally reduces the number of children killed by firearms — amounting to less than 1 percent. But it greatly reduces the number of motor vehicle deaths — by as much as 4 percent.\n\nUsing a broader or narrower definition of vehicle deaths. The CDC lists both deaths just from traffic-related crashes and an overall motor vehicle category that would include pedestrian and other deaths, such as death while in a stationary car. Using only traffic-related crashes further reduces the motor vehicle number by as much as 11 percent, depending on the year. The New England Journal of Medicine article uses the broader definition, but Johns Hopkins reports rely just on traffic crashes.\n\n“There’s no ‘right answer,’ I suppose, but faced with having to pick just one out of two reasonable alternatives, we chose the more inclusive definition,” said Jason Goldstick of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, a co-author of the New England Journal of Medicine study. “Both could be critiqued, but we certainly did not want to be perceived as choosing the narrower definition in service to some nonscientific objective.”\n\nThere is also no question that so many firearm deaths of children is unique to the United States compared with similarly large and wealthy nations. None has firearm deaths among the top four causes of death for children, according to a 2023 study by KFF, a health policy organization. The U. S. mortality rate is nearly 10 times that of Canada, which among U.S. peers has the second-highest child and teen firearm death rate. There are so few firearm deaths of children in other countries that it ranks 15th as a cause of death in Japan and Britain, and 13th in Germany and the Netherlands, KFF said.\n\n“Both the 2022 and 2023 Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence analysis of CDC data shows gun violence is the leading cause of death among children 1 to 17 years old as well as teens 18 and 19 years old,” Cassandra Crifasi, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a statement. “The Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions includes 18 and 19-year-olds with this age range to group children with adolescents as defined by the World Health Organization and New England Journal of Medicine. No matter what age range, gun violence claims far too many lives. It’s our job to work to prevent these deaths in the first place.”\n\nA White House official said it is standard practice for such research reports to include 18- and 19-year-olds in the data. He noted that The Washington Post, in writing about one of these reports, used “children” in the headline, even though the report covered gun deaths of children and adolescents.",

  "text": "Indeed, the report says jurors could decide that Biden “did not willfully retain” documents related to Afghanistan and national defense information found at his home. It also says evidence suggests he did not willfully retain documents found at the University of Delaware and that he did not willfully disclose classified information to someone not authorized to receive it. In many cases, the special counsel decided that the documents were mishandled by mistake — or were not especially important anymore, despite the classification level.\n\nThere’s an old saying that a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich; the report certainly indicates that there might be enough evidence to obtain an indictment regarding Biden’s handling of a handful of the documents. But any charges must be proven in court, and the report concedes that the evidence is insufficient to win a conviction. So it’s presumably a frustrating situation for the president — he’s not being charged with wrongdoing, but he doesn’t get his day in court to prove his innocence.\n\n“During many of the interviews with his ghostwriter, Mr. Biden read from his notebooks nearly verbatim, sometimes for an hour or more at a time,” the report says, quoting from audio recordings and transcripts. “At times during these interviews, Mr. Biden took steps to ensure that Zwonitzer did not read or have access to the classified portions of the notebooks. … At other times, however, Mr. Biden read his notes from classified meetings to Zwonitzer nearly word-for-word.”\n\nBiden also retained some notecards, contending in an interview with Zwonitzer that they were in a “gray area” and did not to have to go the National Archives. “That Mr. Biden was mistaken in his legal judgment is not enough to prove he acted willfully, which requires intent to do something the law forbids,” the report says.\n\nThe report says that there is evidence that Biden, on three occasions, may have disclosed classified information to Zwonitzer, who did not have clearance. But, the report says, “we do not believe the evidence supports charges of willful disclosure beyond a reasonable doubt.” That’s because Biden, while speaking to Zwonitzer, indicated uncertainty about whether the passages in his notebook that he was reading were classified. As a result, “we conclude that the evidence does not establish that Mr. Biden willfully disclosed national defense information to Zwonitzer.”\n\nThe FBI found in Biden’s Delaware garage a cache of documents related to a 2009 Obama administration debate over whether to send additional troops to Afghanistan — a policy step Biden fiercely opposed. The report considers whether Biden may have once had the documents in a Virginia home he rented in 2017, given that he told Zwonitzer at one point that he had “just found all the classified stuff downstairs.” But the report could not determine precisely what these documents were — and thus whether they were classified — and whether the Afghanistan materials found in Delaware had ever been in Virginia.\n\nMoreover, the report noted that Biden, as vice president, had the right to retain the documents at his Delaware home and that he regained that right as president. So he could be charged only with retaining the documents for the period in between. Although dozens of people were interviewed, “all denied knowing that the classified Afghanistan documents were in the box, and all denied knowing when or how the box and its contents arrived in the garage, or who put them there.” Separately, while some other classified documents were found in notebooks at Biden’s home, the report said “the evidence does not show that Mr. Biden knew the classified documents were in his home, and it is plausible that they were stored there by mistake.”\n\nThe report also said that the many documents may no longer be sensitive. “The Afghanistan documents are now almost fifteen years old,” the report said. “While there is evidence that some contain national defense information, in general, they concern a conflict that is now over, in a country where there are no longer any American troops, about a subject (the 2009 troop surge) that has already been widely discussed in books and media reports. At a trial, we expect the defense would strongly challenge whether the documents still contain sensitive national defense information.”\n\nA key document found in Biden’s home was a 2009 handwritten memo to Obama, sent around Thanksgiving that year, expressing strong opposition to the Afghanistan troop surge. The memo discussed a November 2009 State Department cable, and the cable itself, which is marked “Confidential,” is clipped to the memo. Biden told investigators he guessed he had held onto the memo for “for posterity’s sake” as it reflected his position on the Afghan policy. But he said he did not believe it was classified when he discussed it with Zwonitzer. (The report notes that Bob Woodward described the memo in detail in his 2010 book “Obama’s Wars.”)\n\n“The evidence supports an innocent explanation for the unauthorized retention of those documents,” the report says — mainly that staff members forgot about them and unwittingly moved them out of the West Wing at the end of the administration. The report says there is no evidence that Biden reviewed the documents or moved them himself.",

  "text": "“But if you take a look at my words right after, you take a look at my speech from the Rose Garden, which was very shortly after. … If you take a look at those five or six tweets, you will see very beautiful, very heartwarming statements. ‘Go home, the police are doing their job, etc., etc.’ Beautiful statement. If you see my statement made in the Rose Garden, I think you have to watch that today.”\n\nAfter saying he’d listened to the Supreme Court oral arguments Thursday on whether Colorado and other states can bar him from appearing on the ballot in his bid to return to the White House, Trump reverted to one of his signature falsehoods. The ballot case centers on whether Trump is disqualified from office because he supported an insurrection. Trump, in his Mar-a-Lago remarks, referred to what his detractors “kept saying about what I said right after the insurrection … if it was an insurrection.” He claimed that what he really did was offer “very beautiful, very heartwarming statements” during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. He also suggested people should view the video he posted late in the day — or as he put it, “very shortly after.”\n\nIn reality, as documented in the House select committee report on the Jan. 6 attack and other reporting, Trump was reluctant to take action to calm the situation, even as his staff pleaded with him to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol. Trump’s tweets were so inadequate, in the view of staff members, that many resolved to resign. Even his children Ivanka and Donald Jr. found the tweets to be inappropriate. Nearly three hours passed before Trump finally told the rioters to “go home.”\n\nAccording to the committee’s report: “Evidence shows that the 2:24 p.m. tweet immediately precipitated further violence at the Capitol. Immediately after this tweet, the crowds both inside and outside of the Capitol building violently surged forward. Outside the building, within 10 minutes thousands of rioters overran the line on the west side of the Capitol that was being held by the Metropolitan Police Force’s Civil Disturbance Unit, the first time in history of the DC Metro Police that such a security line had ever been broken.”\n\nDeputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger told the committee that the tweet convinced him to resign that day. “I read it and was quite disturbed by it,” he told the committee. “I was disturbed and worried to see that the President was attacking Vice President Pence for doing his constitutional duty. So the tweet looked to me like the opposite of what we really needed at that moment, which was a de-escalation. …. It looked like fuel being poured on the fire.”\n\nThe committee report says that Trump’s daughter Ivanka rushed to the Oval Office dining room, where Trump was watching coverage of the riot on Fox News. “Although no one could convince President Trump to call for the violent rioters to leave the Capitol, Ivanka persuaded President Trump that a tweet could be issued to discourage violence against the police,” the report said.\n\nSince the committee’s report was issued, ABC News has reported that special counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting Trump for his efforts to overturn the election, has developed evidence that Trump did not write this tweet. Instead it was written by his deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino, ABC said. (Scavino had refused to be interviewed by the committee, but he spoke to Smith’s team after a judge overruled claims of executive privilege.) Scavino was the only other person who had access to Trump’s Twitter account, and he said he was blindsided by the tweet attacking Pence. Scavino printed out proposed messages to post on Twitter, which Trump refused to approve until Ivanka’s intervention.\n\nThe committee’s report said that Trump had even resisted using the word “peaceful.” It quotes Sarah Matthews, who was the deputy White House press secretary, about a conversation she had with Ivanka after Matthews expressed concern the tweet did not go far enough. “In a hushed tone [she] shared with me that the President did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet and that it took some convincing on their part, those who were in the room,” Matthews told the committee.\n\nThis tweet also did not tell people to go home — and even suggested they could remain in the Capitol, as long as they were peaceful. The report says there is evidence that Trump knew by this time that someone had been shot during the melee.\n\nThe committee’s report says that Trump repeatedly resisted telling people to go home. “Almost everyone, including staff in the White House, also found the President’s 2:38 p.m. and 3:13 p.m. tweets to be insufficient because they did not instruct the rioters to leave the Capitol.” It quotes texts to Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, from outsiders, such as Trump’s son Donald Jr. and Fox News host Sean Hannity, urging a stronger response. “I saw the tweet. Ask people to peacefully leave the capital [sic],” Hannity wrote.\n\nThe video has its intended effect — the riot ends — but it came nearly three hours after Trump learned of the attack. The committee’s report suggests Trump issued the video only once it was clear the riot would fail to end the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory.\n\n“Down at the Capitol, the video began streaming onto rioters’ phones, and by all accounts including video footage taken by other rioters, they listened to President Trump’s command,” the report said. “ ‘Donald Trump has asked everybody to go home,’ one rioter shouted as he “deliver[ed] the President’s message.’ ‘That’s our order,’ another rioter responded. Others watching the video responded: ‘He says, go home.’ ”",

  "text": "Israel’s military said Marman and Har were both in “good medical condition.” They were transported via military helicopters to Sheba Tel Hashomer Medical Center in Israel, where the medical staff said their condition was “stable” and where they were reunited with their families.\n\n“I salute our brave warriors for the bold action that led to their liberation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. “Only the continuation of military pressure until complete victory will result in the release of all our abductees. We will not miss any opportunity to bring them home.”\n\nArmed Hamas militants were guarding the men and were also spread throughout the building, he said. A minute later, he said, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes; Israeli soldiers shielded the hostages with their bodies as other troops exchanged heavy fire with Hamas fighters.\n\nNetanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were with Israel’s military chief as the raid unfolded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting, the military said. In a visit Monday with the unit that carried out the operation, Netanyahu called it “one of the most successful rescue raids in the history of Israel. … A perfect operation that was perfectly executed.”\n\nIt was only the second successful rescue mission since the start of the ground incursion into Gaza in late October — on Oct. 30, the IDF rescued a female hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, in addition to 29 others who are believed to be dead, most of them killed during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMany of the families of the hostages and the thousands of Israelis who have joined them in street protests have called on the government to agree to a deal with Hamas to exchange hostages for prisoners, believing it is the only way to guarantee the safety of their loved ones and questioning whether military operations are a realistic strategy on a larger scale.\n\n“We commend the IDF soldiers who demonstrated strength and bravery to secure the release of the two hostages, and wish them all to return home safely and speedily,” said a statement Monday by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing most of the families.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei lauded the rescue operation Monday morning and said in a social media post that in a meeting with Netanyahu last week in Jerusalem, he requested “the release of every one of the Argentine hostages” and continued to “maintain his condemnation of Hamas terrorism.”\n\nThe operation came hours after Netanyahu spoke on the phone with President Biden, who warned that an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah without appropriate accommodations for the civilian population would be seen as unacceptable to the United States, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nOn Monday, it remained unclear how the rescue — lasting about an hour and limited in its scope — would affect Israel’s broader plans for a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, where it says Hamas’s top leaders are hiding, using the remaining hostages as shields.\n\nEgypt has reinforced its border, signaling that it would not accept an exodus of refugees fleeing the fighting. It has warned that an Israeli invasion of the area along its border could endanger the countries’ 1979 peace treaty that has for decades stabilized the region.\n\nThe rescue operation was carried out amid negotiations to return the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as a halt in the fighting. Senior American, Egyptian and Qatari officials are expected to convene in Cairo on Tuesday; it is still unclear if Israel will send a delegation.\n\nDavid Tsur, former head of Yamam, the special counterterrorism unit that was among the agencies involved in the overnight mission, said that because the talks have been so far unsuccessful, the Israeli army took advantage of the “very short window of opportunity” to free the hostages. But he said it will have consequences for future operations.",

  "text": "JERUSALEM — The historic Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza’s oldest active church, was struck Thursday by Israel as it sheltered hundreds of Palestinians displaced by the war, according to religious officials. Maher Ayyad, 72, a member of the community, said the strike hit a two-story building in the church compound, killing 18 people and injuring at least 20. About 100 people were in the bombed building at the time of the strike, he said, and about 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.\n\nAmash tweeted Friday afternoon that several relatives who had been sheltering in the church, including two women he identified as Viola and Yara, were killed in the strike.\n\nThere are about 1,000 Palestinian Christians remaining in Gaza, and the loss was “huge” for the community, Ayyad said. About 500 Christians, including Ayyad, have relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.\n\nThe Washington Post geolocated the strike and confirmed the location of the church based on a video that shows people searching through rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem blamed Israel for the strike.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in an emailed statement that a strike targeting a Hamas control center “damaged the wall of a church in the area” and that it was “aware of reports on casualties” and was reviewing the incident. They declined to provide further information and reiterated, “It is important to clarify that the Church was not the target of the strike.”\n\nAyyad is also a medical director at al-Ahli Hospital, where a blast Tuesday killed 471 people and injured more than 300, according to Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has disputed that death toll.\n\nThe Order of St. George, an associated order of the church, issued a statement confirming Thursday’s strike. “Archbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don’t know if he is injured,” the Order of St. George stated. The blast hit “two church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping.”\n\nThe Church of St. Porphyrius’s original structure dated to the 5th century, and the current structure, in a historic quarter of the city, was built in the 12th century. It is named for a former bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, and placed where he is believed to have died in A. D. 420. The church, characterized by thick walls and a richly decorated interior, has long been a place of refuge and community for its members, who are a religious minority in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA Palestinian American woman who moved from Gaza to the United States in the early 2000s said in an interview that she had relatives and friends sheltering in the church at the time of the strike, some of whom were injured.\n\n“They’re terrified. They’re shaken. They don’t know what to do, and they don’t know where else to go,” said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her family’s safety. She expressed outrage at the idea that more than 1 million civilians could evacuate from a place as densely populated and heavily bombed as Gaza City — a mass movement called for by Israel last week. “It’s impossible,” she said.\n\nShe said that she grew up going to the Church of St. Porphyrius and that her family has deep ties to the church, dating to when they became refugees during the 1948 founding of Israel and mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nDescribing the congregation as close-knit and family-like, she said she’s not only worried about her relatives. “I’m concerned for everyone because we’re a small community.”\n\nChristians make up about 1 percent of Gaza’s population and have faced restrictions and discrimination by the Hamas government, according to human rights groups. During the 2014 Gaza war, about 1,000 Palestinian Muslims fled Israeli shelling for the Church of St. Porphyrius, where graves were damaged by shrapnel from a nearby strike, Reuters reported.",

  "text": "MANILA — At least 55 people died and 32 were injured in one of the southern Philippines’ deadliest landslides in recent years, the government of Davao de Oro province said Monday. Search and retrieval operations are still underway for dozens more missing after the landslide that took place  Tuesday night on the southern island of Mindanao in the mining town of Maco, some 600 miles south of the capital, Manila. The death toll is expected to rise as the government verifies more dead and missing. A local official said during a live-streamed news conference late Monday afternoon that of the bodies that have been recovered, five  remain unidentified and that 51 people are still unaccounted for.\n\nThe landslide swept away three buses and a jeepney carrying miners and buried a village, according to authorities. The region was inundated by floods in the past week, hampering rescue operations. One of the survivors identified in recent days is a 3-year-old girl.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the U. S. Agency for International Development said it is providing about $1.25 million in humanitarian aid for communities hit by flooding and landslides in Davao de Oro and surrounding provinces on Mindanao.\n\nThe miners in the buses and jeepney, an elongated jeep-like vehicle widely used for public transportation, worked for the Philippine company Apex Mining, which operates a gold mine in Maco. The company said in a statement Saturday that it was assisting the government with relief and rescue operations.\n\n“The company is deeply saddened by this tragedy, and we can only imagine the pain that the families of the missing and the dead are going through,” said Luis Sarmiento, president and CEO of Apex Mining.\n\nEnvironmental groups have called for an independent investigation into the mining company. However, as of Saturday, government officials attributed the landslide primarily to heavy rainfall. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau said the affected area is outside the mining site, although the company’s transport vehicles were “temporarily stationed” there.\n\nLandslides occurred there in 2007 and 2008, according to local officials, but residents eventually moved back to be closer to their work, believing it was safe. Around 21 died in the last landslide, Edward Macapili, executive assistant for communications for Davao de Oro, told The Washington Post.\n\n“There is a policy that this is a no-build zone,” Macapili told radio station Teleradyo Serbisyo on Saturday. “After 2008, people went back, and it was tolerated by the previous administration of the provincial government of Davao de Oro and Apex Mining itself.”\n\nThe vulnerability of communities in hazard-prone areas is a common issue in the Philippines, an archipelago that is racked by such various disasters as earthquakes and typhoons.\n\n“People should not have been allowed to settle in that place, and there is no excuse for all who are responsible for allowing it,” said Mahar Lagmay, executive director of the Resilience Institute at the University of the Philippines. Lagmay urged the government to follow international guidelines on risk assessment and hazard mapping, not just for identifying danger zones but for spotting livable areas, too.\n\nExtensive rainfall in the southern Philippines has impacted more than a million people in the past week, leaving hundreds of thousands displaced, the U. S. Embassy in Manila said.",

  "text": "Jon Stewart returned to his old seat behind the desk of “The Daily Show” on Monday evening after a nearly nine-year hiatus, resuming his role as the late night show’s host just in time for the 2024 presidential election. Stewart did not spare President Biden or former president Donald Trump from pointed jokes — spotlighting how the front-runners in both parties are 81 and 77, respectively. And that 2024 is shaping up to look a lot like 2020.\n\n“We are not suggesting neither man is vibrant, productive or even capable. But they are both stretching the limits of being able to handle the toughest job in the world,” Stewart said. “It is not crazy to think that the oldest people in the history of the country to ever run for president might have some of these challenges.”\n\nWhile Biden and Trump would each be the oldest president by the end of their term if elected, previous elections also saw some older candidates, such as former New York mayor  Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who were both 78 while running in 2020.\n\n“The next nine months or so — and maybe more than that depending on the coup schedule — are gonna suck,” Stewart said, in a glib reference to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on the U. S. Capitol. “On the plus side, I’m told that at some point, the sun will run out of hydrogen,” Stewart said at one point.\n\nIn particular, the late night host zeroed in on a line in last week’s report by special counsel Robert K. Hur that described the president as “an elderly man with a poor memory,” mocking also the White House’s efforts to then reassure voters of Biden’s fitness for office.\n\n“My memory is fine,” Biden said Thursday, responding angrily to questioning of his mental fitness. “I’m the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States and finish the job I started,” he said. At the same news conference, Biden mistakenly referred to Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi as the president of Mexico during a discussion about facilitating aid into Gaza. “Geography buffs might have noticed that Gaza and Mexico do not share a border,” Stewart quipped.\n\nStewart defended his  swipes at Biden — which came thick and fast — as an exercise in his democratic duty. “The stakes of this election don’t make Donald Trump’s opponent less subject to scrutiny,” he said. “It actually makes him more subject to scrutiny.”\n\nStewart also criticized  Biden’s foreign policy, challenging the president on the language he used to characterize Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Last week, Biden said Israel’s military offensive was “over the top” — marking his sharpest rebuke of Israel yet.\n\n“I like how Biden describes Israel’s incessant bombing of civilians the same way my mother describes the Super Bowl halftime show: ‘It was a little much,’” Stewart said in response. Gaza’s Health Ministry reports that more than 28,000 people have been killed in the enclave. Israel launched the war after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack that killed around 1,200 people.\n\nAfter Biden’s campaign announced over the weekend that it was joining TikTok in an effort to appeal to younger voters, Stewart said the president’s first clip seemed to have the reverse effect.\n\nIn a series of quick-fire answers to questions about the Super Bowl, Biden declined to “choose” between footballer siblings Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce, who play for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs respectively. He said his favorite Kelce was “Momma Kelce” instead. “I understand she makes great chocolate chip cookies,” Biden said in the uploaded video.\n\nStewart will headline the show’s popular Monday night slot throughout the 2024 election cycle, with rotating hosts throughout the rest of the week. He previously hosted the show from 1999 to 2015. During that time, the show transformed the late night comedy landscape, won 24 Emmys and frequently went viral on social media. Last year, Comedy Central said that the show’s next permanent host will be announced in 2024, filling a seat left vacant by Trevor Noah since December 2022.\n\nStewart pointed out that it’s not just the presidential candidates who have aged. “Look at me,” he said. “Look what time hath wrought. Give the kids a treat of the lunar surface here,” he said beckoning the camera to zoom in on his face.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nTesla worker killed in fiery crash may be first ‘Full Self-Driving’ fatalityEvidence suggests the advanced driver-assistance system was engaged during a fatal crash that killed recruiter Hans von Ohain in 2022Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. The following footage obtained by The Washington Post shows Colorado authorities responding to a car crash on May 16, 2022, in Evergreen, Colo.This story is best experienced with sound.Hans von Ohain and Erik Rossiter were on their way to play golf one afternoon in 2022 when von Ohain’s Tesla suddenly swerved off Upper Bear Creek Road. The car’s driver-assistance software, Full Self-Driving, was struggling to navigate the mountain curves, forcing von Ohain repeatedly to yank it back on course.“The first time it happened, I was like, ‘Is that normal?’” recalled Rossiter, who described the five-mile drive on the outskirts of Denver as “uncomfortable.” “And he was like, ‘Yeah, that happens every now and then.’”Hours later, on the way home, the Tesla Model 3 barreled into a tree and exploded in flames, killing von Ohain, a Tesla employee and devoted fan of CEO Elon Musk. Rossiter, who survived the crash, told emergency responders that von Ohain was using an “auto-drive feature on the Tesla” that “just ran straight off the road,” according to a 911 dispatch recording obtained by The Washington Post. In a recent interview, Rossiter said he believes that von Ohain was using Full Self-Driving, which — if true — would make his death the first known fatality involving Tesla’s most advanced driver-assistance technology.Tesla owners have long complained of occasionally erratic behavior by the cars’ software, including sudden braking, missed road markings and crashes with parked emergency vehicles. Since federal regulators began requiring automakers to report crashes involving driver-assistance systems in 2021, they have logged more than 900 in Teslas, including at least 40 that resulted in serious or fatal injuries, according to a Post analysis.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselHow The Post determined Full Self-Driving likely was engagedThe crash appears in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s database of crashes reported to involve driver assistance software. Tesla reported the crash to NHTSA after receiving a complaint from an unspecified source.A purchase order obtained by The Post shows the car was equipped with Full Self-Driving, and the driver’s widow said he used it frequently, especially on the road where the crash occurred.A passenger who survived the crash said the driver used Full Self-Driving earlier in the day, and that he believes the feature was engaged at the time of the crash.According to 911 dispatch audio obtained by The Post, the survivor told emergency responders that an “auto-drive” feature had been in use. A state police investigator told The Post that crash dynamics were consistent with the feature’s use.Most involved Autopilot, which is designed for use on controlled-access highways. No fatal crash has been definitively linked to the more sophisticated Full Self-Driving, which is programmed to guide the car almost anywhere, from quiet suburban roads to busy city streets.Two years ago, a Tesla shareholder tweeted that there “has not been one accident or injury” involving Full Self-Driving, to which Musk responded: “Correct.” But if that was accurate at the time, it no longer appears to be so. A Tesla driver who caused an eight-car pileup with multiple injuries on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in 2022 told police he was using Full Self-Driving. And The Post has linked the technology to at least two serious crashes, including the one that killed von Ohain.Von Ohain and Rossiter had been drinking, and an autopsy found that von Ohain died with a blood alcohol level of 0.26 — more than three times the legal limit — a level of intoxication that would have hampered his ability to maintain control of the car, experts said. Still, an investigation by the Colorado State Patrol went beyond drunken driving, seeking to understand what role the Tesla software may have played in the crash.“Next thing I remember is waking up in the vehicle.”The question is critical as automakers race toward the promise of a driverless future. For private vehicles, that day is far from here. But critics say features like Full Self-Driving already are giving drivers a false sense of confidence about taking their eyes off the road — or getting behind the wheel after drinking — evincing the dangers of letting consumers test an evolving, experimental technology on the open road.Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The company, which has released Full Self-Driving to about 400,000 customers, acknowledges that the software is in “beta” mode — meaning still in development, constantly learning and being modified. But Tesla argues that its public release is an essential step toward reducing America’s 40,000 annual road deaths. “The more automation technology offered to support the driver, the safer the driver and other road users,” Tesla tweeted in December.At the same time, Tesla user manuals cite a long list of conditions under which Full Self-Driving may not function properly, including narrow roads with oncoming cars and curvy roads. The company has long maintained that drivers must control their cars and that Tesla is not liable for distracted or drunken driving.[Tesla drivers run Autopilot where it’s not intended — with deadly consequences]Multiple lawsuits have begun challenging the view that drivers are solely responsible when Tesla’s software allegedly causes crashes or fails to prevent them. So far, Tesla has prevailed. Last fall, a California jury found Tesla not liable for a 2019 Autopilot crash in which survivors said the car suddenly veered off the road. At least nine more cases are expected to go to trial this year.Von Ohain’s widow, Nora Bass, said she has been unable to find a lawyer willing to take his case to court because he was legally intoxicated. Nonetheless, she said, Tesla should take at least some responsibility for her husband’s death.“Regardless of how drunk Hans was, Musk has claimed that this car can drive itself and is essentially better than a human,” Bass said. “We were sold a false sense of security.”Hans von Ohain’s Tesla was on fire after the crash. (Obtained by The Washington Post)Von Ohain used Full Self-Driving nearly every time he got behind the wheel, Bass said, placing him among legions of Tesla boosters heeding Musk’s call to generate data and build the technology’s mastery. While Bass refused to use the feature herself — she said its unpredictability stressed her out — her husband was so confident in all it promised that he even used it with their baby in the car.“It was jerky, but we were like, that comes with the territory of” new technology, Bass said. “We knew the technology had to learn, and we were willing to be part of that.”“Now it feels like we were just guinea pigs.”Von Ohain, a former Marine originally from Cincinnati, joined Tesla in late 2020 as a recruiter for engineers, attracted to the company’s mission of bringing electric and autonomous vehicles to the masses, Bass said. He also was inspired by the idea of working for Musk, she said — a “brilliant man” who built a company that promised to save lives and make the roadways safer.Von Ohain “had this opportunity to be part of a company that is working on insanely advanced technology, and we had always thought Elon Musk was interesting,” Bass said. “Hans was so interested in brilliant minds.”At the time, Tesla had just introduced Full Self-Driving, and would eventually release it to a wider group of owners who had been monitored by the carmaker and declared safe drivers. Like many Tesla employees, von Ohain received the feature — then a $10,000 option — free with his employee discount, according to Bass and a purchase order reviewed by The Post.Though still in its beta phase, the technology is “the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero,” Musk has said, noting his customers’ — and investors’ — enthusiasm for a fully autonomous car. Many major automakers were developing advanced driver-assistance technology, but Tesla was more aggressive in pushing sophisticated features out to an eager public.Von Ohain’s parents, Chris and Pam, at their home in Cincinnati. His father said he was disappointed in Tesla for not treating “their own employee who died in their vehicle with a little more empathy.”For years, Musk had preached the benefits of pursuing autonomous driving. In 2019, he predicted that it would one day be so reliable that drivers “could go to sleep” — though, for now, Tesla’s user agreement requires the driver to stay engaged and ready to take over from Full Self-Driving at all times.In 2022, Tesla recalled more than 50,000 vehicles amid concerns that Full Self-Driving caused the car to roll through stop signs without coming to a full halt. Even as Musk tweeted months later that Tesla had made Full Self-Driving Beta available to anyone in North America who bought it, complaints continued to pile up: Drivers reported that cars would stop short, blow through stop signs or suddenly veer off the road when lane markings were unclear.“We test as much as possible in simulation and with [quality assurance] drivers, but reality is vastly more complex,” Musk tweeted last spring about a new version of the software. Tesla employees would get it first, he said, with wider release to come “as confidence grows.”[Tesla conducts largest-ever recall for ‘insufficient’ safety controls after exclusive Post report on Autopilot]“I’m glad it wasn’t Nora and his daughter in that car.”On the day of the crash, von Ohain and Rossiter played 21 holes of golf, downing multiple drinks along the way. Though an autopsy would later show that von Ohain was legally drunk, Rossiter said he seemed composed and “by no means intoxicated” as they got in the Tesla and headed home.Rossiter, who was found to have a similar blood alcohol level, can recall only shreds of the crash: A bright orange glow. Careening off the road. Jumping out of the car and trying to pull his friend out. The driver’s-side door blocked by a fallen tree.As Rossiter yelled for help on the deserted mountain road, he remembers, his friend was screaming inside the burning car.Colorado State Patrol Sgt. Robert Madden, who oversaw the agency’s investigation, said it was one of “the most intense” vehicle fires he had ever seen. Fueled by thousands of lithium-ion battery cells in the car’s undercarriage, according to the investigation report, the fire is what killed von Ohain: His cause of death was listed as “smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.” Madden said he probably would have survived the impact alone.At the scene of the crash, Madden said, he found “rolling tire marks,” meaning the motor continued to feed power to the wheels after impact. There were no skid marks, Madden said, meaning von Ohain appeared not to have hit the brakes.“Given the crash dynamics and how the vehicle drove off the road with no evidence of a sudden maneuver, that fits with the [driver-assistance] feature” being engaged, Madden said.Colorado police were unable to access data from the car because of the intensity of the fire, according to the investigation report, and Tesla said it could not confirm that a driver-assistance system had been in use because it “did not receive data over-the-air for this incident.” Madden said the remote location may have hindered communications.However, Tesla did report the crash to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to NHTSA, Tesla received notification of the crash through an unspecified “complaint” and alerted federal authorities that a driver-assistance feature had been in use at least 30 seconds before impact. Because of the extensive fire damage, NHTSA could not confirm whether it was Full Self-Driving or Autopilot.In December, Tesla acknowledged problems with driver inattention, issuing a recall for nearly all of its 2 million U.S. cars to add more-frequent alerts. Bass said that von Ohain knew he needed to pay attention but that his focus naturally flagged with Full Self-Driving.“You’re told that this car should be smarter than you, so when it’s in Full Self-Driving, you relax,” she said. “Your reaction time is going to be less than if we were not in Full Self-Driving.”Erik Rossiter, the passenger who survived the Tesla crash, on the road where it occurred. Rossiter told emergency responders at the scene that von Ohain was using an “auto drive feature on the Tesla.”Charred remnants of the Tesla after the crash. Von Ohain's wife, Nora Bass, said her husband believed in the promise of Full Self-Driving and used it often, despite its sometimes startling behavior. (Obtained by The Washington Post)Alcohol also dramatically slows reaction time, and von Ohain’s intoxication probably factored heavily in the crash, said Ed Walters, who teaches autonomous vehicle law at Georgetown University. If the technology was acting up on the way to the golf course, as Rossiter claims, von Ohain should have known that he needed to remain fully alert on the drive home, Walters said.“This driver, when sober, was able to pull the car back on the road and was able to correct for any problems in the Tesla safely,” Walters said. “People need to understand that whatever kind of car they’re driving, whatever kind of software, they need to be paying attention. They need to be sober and they need to be careful.”Still, Andrew Maynard, a professor of advanced technology transitions at Arizona State University, said reports of the car’s frequent swerving raise questions about Tesla’s decision to release Full Self-Driving.“The FSD technology isn’t quite ready for prime time yet,” Maynard said, adding that the value of testing the technology on the open road should be weighed against the risks of pushing it out too quickly to drivers who overestimate its capabilities.[Why Tesla Autopilot shouldn’t be used in as many places as you think]“I have so many questions.”Nearly two years later, mangled car parts and charred battery cells are still strewn along Upper Bear Creek Road. Madden closed the Colorado State Patrol investigation, unable to determine whether Full Self-Driving played a role.In a recent interview, Madden said he worries about the proliferation of sophisticated driver-assistance systems. “Autonomous vehicles are something of the future, and they are going to be here,” he said. “So the more we know, the more we understand, the safer we can continue into the future with this” technology.Meanwhile, Tesla has yet to publicly acknowledge the death of an employee driving one of its cars.To its workforce, the company has said little about what happened to von Ohain, making few efforts to console those who knew him, according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Von Ohain’s replacement was hired within a few weeks, the person said.“Once Hans passed away and time went by, there wasn’t any more discussion about him,” said the former employee, a member of von Ohain’s team who soon resigned.To von Ohain’s widow, Tesla’s silence seemed almost cruel.Though the company eventually helped cover the cost of her move back home to Ohio, Bass said, Tesla’s first communication with the family after the crash was a termination notice she found in her husband’s email.Additional development by Jake Crump.

  "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Leading artificial intelligence companies are planning to sign an “accord” committing to developing tech to identify, label and control AI-generated images, videos and audio recordings that aim to deceive voters ahead of crucial elections in multiple countries this year. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.The agreement, developed by Google, Microsoft and Meta, as well as OpenAI, Adobe and TikTok, however, does not ban deceptive political AI content, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. X, previously Twitter, was not a signatory to the agreement.\n\nInstead, the document amounts to a manifesto stating that AI-generated content, much of which is created by the companies’ tools and posted on their platforms, does present risks to fair elections, and it outlines steps to try to mitigate that risk, like labeling suspected AI content and educating the public on the dangers of AI.\n\n“The intentional and undisclosed generation and distribution of deceptive AI election content can deceive the public in ways that jeopardize the integrity of electoral processes,” the agreement reads. More companies could sign on to the accord.\n\n“In a critical year for global elections, technology companies are working on an accord to combat the deceptive use of AI targeted at voters. Adobe, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, TikTok and others are working jointly toward progress on this shared objective and we hope to finalize and present details on Friday at the Munich Security Conference,” David Cuddy, a spokesperson for Microsoft said in an emailed statement.\n\nAI-generated images, or “deepfakes,” have been around for several years. But in the past year, they have rapidly improved in quality, to the point where some fake videos, images and audio recordings are difficult to distinguish from real ones. The tools to make them are also now widely available, making their production much easier.\n\nTech companies have been under pressure from regulators, AI researchers and political activists to rein in the spread of fake election content. The new agreement is similar to a voluntary pledge the same companies, plus several others, signed in July after a meeting at the White House, where they committed to try to identify and label fake AI content on their sites. In the new accord, the companies also commit to educating users on deceptive AI content and being transparent about their efforts to identify deepfakes.\n\nThe tech companies also already have their own policies on political AI-generated content. TikTok doesn’t allow fake AI content of public figures when it is being used for political or commercial endorsements. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, requires political advertisers to disclose whether they use AI in ads on its platforms. YouTube requires creators to label AI-generated content that looks realistic when they post it on the Google-owned video site.\n\nStill, attempts to build a broad system in which AI content is identified and labeled across social media have yet to come to fruition. Google has shown off “watermarking” technology but doesn’t require its customers to use it. Adobe, the owner of Photoshop, has positioned itself as a leader in reining in AI content, but its own stock photo website was recently full of fake images of the war in Gaza.",

  "text": "D. C. Public Schools officials unveiled a budget proposal Tuesday that will send more money to some campuses but could require hundreds of staff cuts as the system braces for the expiration of pandemic relief and rising costs for personnel and other expenses.Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning.D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) is slated to ask city council members to back a “historic” boost to the city’s per-pupil funding formula — a 12.4 percent increase that will flush the city’s traditional public school system with an additional $181 million. But school district leaders still predict a strained budget because of a confluence of factors: higher teacher salaries, rising costs due to inflation and the need to use local revenues to cover expenses that were previously funded by one-time federal pandemic aid.\n\nThe proposal unveiled Tuesday offers an early glimpse at the budget pressures leaders in D. C. and elsewhere in the region will face in the coming months because of larger economic hardships, including strained tax revenues.\n\n“We are heading into the most difficult budget season since the Great Recession. Federal relief funds are ending, our personnel and operational costs are higher and commercial property tax collections are lower,” Bowser said in a statement. “We know that even as we increase our local investments in public education, our schools will still feel the impacts of right sizing.”\n\nIn the last budget cycle, Bowser requested a 5 percent increase to the per-pupil funding formula that largely determines how schools are funded. This year’s ask demonstrates just how large a gap schools could face as policy experts are warning of an impending fiscal cliff in D. C. and beyond because of the lapse of pandemic-era money.\n\nMore than 100  of DCPS’ 117 schools will see bigger budgets this year, said Lewis D. Ferebee, the system’s chancellor. Still, the system could eliminate upward of 5 percent of its full-time school-based positions, roughly 450 staffers. There are also plans to cut 10 percent of central office staff positions.\n\nBut the pressure on these communities follows national trends — districts grew their staffs throughout the pandemic to help deal with its fallout and now must scale back. Over the last five years, D. C. public schools increased staff by 18 percent. Enrollment, meanwhile, jumped by just 2 percent.\n\nSchools will have two weeks to provide feedback on the budget proposals. Ferebee plans to share a guide with schools to help them navigate challenges with affording staff.\n\nBeyond D. C., schools across the country are facing tough decisions about what services to continue as the federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief runs out. Since 2020, the federal government has issued $190 billion — its largest-ever one-time infusion of cash — to help schools navigate the pandemic by supporting virtual learning, the reopening of schools and tutoring programs. Traditional public and charter schools in D.C. received $540 million of that share. The last of those dollars must be spent or planned by September.\n\nD. C. Public Schools has spent its share of those dollars — roughly $304 million — on a variety of efforts, from laptops for students and teachers to school-based health staff. Ferebee’s budget proposal indicates he hopes to sustain certain programs with local dollars, including high-impact tutoring and the “Sixth Grade Academies” program that helps students make smooth transitions from elementary to middle school.\n\nThe budget proposal also includes $66 million to cover some recurring costs previously funded with ESSER money. These include security and technology costs, as well as $32 million the D. C. Council redirected to school budgets to bring them in compliance with the city’s Schools First in Budgeting law. The measure, passed in late 2022, sought to stabilize school budgets by ensuring campuses get at least the same amount of money as they did the year prior.\n\nBowser, at the time, opposed the change, arguing it would “create an unsustainable fiscal cliff for public schools.” She also defended the previous school budgeting model and said it prioritized a more equitable distribution of funds.\n\nThe mayor’s budget request, however, will include increased funding for at-risk students — a broad term the city uses to describe those who are homeless or in foster care, whose families qualify for food stamps, or who are in high school and have been held back at least one year — as well as adult learners and those enrolled in the city’s alternative schools.",

  "text": "A passenger has died aboard Royal Caribbean’s nine-month world cruise, the company said in a statement Tuesday.“A guest sailing on board Serenade of the Seas has sadly passed away,” the statement said. “We are actively providing support and assistance to the guest’s loved ones at this time. Out of the privacy of the guest and their family, we have nothing further to share at this time.”\n\n“First, some sad news. We had our first death on the Ultimate World Cruise,” a passenger who goes by Adita said in a TikTok video. “She was an elderly lady. The reason why I know is because I was coming to my room when they were taking the body out. So very, very sad for me because I was there to watch.”\n\nThe original video has been removed, but it was posted in a report from a cruise watcher who described the update as “Ultimate World Cruise Tea Time Depressing Edition.”\n\nThe company did not confirm that it was the first death during the voyage, which set sail in December. Official statistics on the number of people who die on a cruise are not made public, but a 2020 study in the International Journal of Travel Medicine and Global Health found that there were 623 reported deaths aboard 78 ocean and river cruise lines between 2000 and 2019. Excluding suicides, the leading causes of passenger deaths were shown to be unspecified natural causes, cardiac incidents and falling overboard or onto lower decks.\n\nFor months, Royal Caribbean’s Ultimate World Cruise has captivated the public like a social media reality show, with reports on storms, coronavirus outbreaks, canceled port calls and interpersonal drama.\n\nThe itinerary on the nine-month expedition includes 65 countries across every continent. Dozens of TikTok accounts have popped up to document the cruise. Some are run by a few of the 600-something travelers staying on board; others are spectators on land.\n\n“People die and people die on cruises,” he said. “And it’s not always as a result of some foul play or accident. That’s why cruise ships have onboard morgues that can have a capacity sometimes up to six to 12 bodies.”\n\nHe said the medical care available on a ship is limited, and it can be difficult and expensive to transfer a sick passenger to land.\n\n“It is important before you go on any cruise, no matter what the duration, to make sure that you are physically fit to sail,” he said.",

Flavonoids are present in many plant products, including fruits, vegetables, tea and coffee. Flavonoids are full of antioxidants, which protect cells from the damaging free radicals that increase the risk of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.\n\nBut you won’t get the same benefits if you eat too much of the wrong kind of chocolate. Many of our favorite chocolates, including those found in many red, heart-shaped boxes, are ultra-processed candy full of added sugar, milk and tropical oils, or even milk or white chocolate. Overdo it, and you may experience heartburn, stomach upset and, over time, weight gain.\n\n“It depends on which chocolate you choose,” said Uma Naidoo, a nutritional psychiatrist and biologist, professional chef, and author of “This is Your Brain on Food: An Indispensable Guide to the Surprising Foods That Fight Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, OCD, ADHD and More.” “A candy bar is not the same as a square of extra-dark natural chocolate. Dark chocolate, in moderation, can be a healthy addition to the daily diet.”\n\nFlavonoids are found in cacao beans and cocoa: terms used interchangeably, but which actually are different. Cacao is the raw material — the beans — that comes from the tree, while the latter results from grinding the beans into a powder, then roasting, and combining with other ingredients, such as sugar, to make chocolate.\n\nCountless studies suggest that flavonoids — including flavonoid subtypes such as flavonols and flavan-3-ols — can lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes; improve mood; and lessen the symptoms of depression. Flavonoids also can help cognition, as well as counteract cognitive deficits that result from sleep deprivation. One study, the large placebo-controlled randomized COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) trial, found no difference in cardiovascular “events,” such as heart attacks, but did show a reduction in heart-disease-related deaths.\n\nDavide Grassi, associate professor of internal medicine at the University of L’Aquila in Sant’Omero, Italy, who has conducted numerous studies examining the health effects of cocoa, agreed. “Cocoa is not the same as the chocolate that we eat every day,” he said. “Flavonoids are good for our blood vessels and overall health and may help reduce the risk of heart problems and other chronic diseases.”\n\nBut it’s important to distinguish natural cocoa, which comes from the cocoa bean in the rainforests, from processed chocolate, which is made by combining cocoa with sugar and other ingredients, he said.\n\nConsider using plain cocoa powder in drinks or baking. “I use it to make energy balls,” said Julia Zumpano, a dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic. “I mash it up with almond butter and dates, make them into balls, and refrigerate them. It’s a great way to get cocoa powder with no saturated fat or added sugar. They’re phenomenal.”\n\nDark chocolate often contains high amounts of cocoa, less sugar and more flavonoids, experts said. Very dark chocolate is the healthiest form of chocolate you can eat. It’s usually lower in sugar than other forms of chocolate and doesn’t contain milk or added fats.\n\n“The darker the better,” said Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. “Milk chocolate has less dark chocolate, and white chocolate has no chocolate at all.” (White chocolate typically is made of cocoa butter, sugar, milk solids and milk fat — but no solid cocoa.)\n\nIt’s not clear how much daily chocolate someone would have to eat for health benefits, since research uses pure cocoa and not commercial chocolate. The latter is processed, which can destroy flavonoids, and contains additives.\n\n“The amount of flavonoids in the COSMOS study would require 600 to 700 calories a day of dark chocolate, and more than 5,000 calories a day of milk chocolate,” said JoAnn Manson, co-leader of COSMOS and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “You’re talking about a large amount of calories, and not a guaranteed content of flavonoids.”\n\nChocolate should not be regarded as a “health” food in the same sense as fresh fruits and vegetables, but no one should feel the need to deprive themselves, experts said. “We definitely don’t want to discourage anyone from eating chocolate because it provides people with joy and happiness,” Manson said.\n\nRimm agreed. “It would be a shame to turn chocolate into medicine when there are other acute pleasures that occur from its consumption, whether it triggers great memories or just reminds someone of a connection,” he said. The research is interesting, although more long-term studies of chocolate may be necessary, he said, adding: “It’s a tough job, but I am happy to volunteer.”\n\nMoreover, they said, even the occasional lapse is okay, especially for love. Grassi, for example, mostly sticks to dark chocolate. “Nevertheless, on some occasions, I prefer to eat milk chocolate, should I be in love at the time,” he said.",

  "text": "But “The Daily Show,” which was never the same after he left, has been rudderless since Stewart’s successor, Trevor Noah, left in 2022. After a year of guest hosts auditioning with no end to the experiment in sight (despite all that new energy and fresh blood), it had started to feel like a dying franchise. The format, too, had come to seem a little vintage, given the speed at which users on social media platforms wittily process (and riff on) current events — frequently in the style Stewart pioneered. Bringing Stewart back for just one day a week (Mondays) would either revitalize “The Daily Show” or confirm it as the zombie some feared it had become.\n\nIt didn’t bode well for Stewart’s prospects that “The Problem with Jon Stewart” was canceled after just two seasons or that, ironically, Stewart’s new show sometimes felt a tad belated and derivative, as if it was borrowing from “Daily Show” alums such as John Oliver and Samantha Bee. There was, moreover, a sense that the man was very much a product of his time. The political climate has changed so quickly, and become so satire-proof, that not even Jon Stewart could be Jon Stewart anymore.\n\nPut differently, there was a concern that Stewart, who left at precisely the moment political discourse and social media went haywire, was — as a master satirist — ill-equipped to address the present in ways that parallel the comedian’s own assessment of the current information crisis: “The form of government we love so much is an analog — I don’t want to say dinosaur — but it is analog,” he told “The Daily Show: Ears Edition” podcast this week, explaining why he wanted to come back, “and the world now moves at an increasingly infinite digital pace. And reconciling those two things, I think, is the challenge of the moment for people.”\n\nBased on Monday’s performance, however, Stewart can still Stewart when the conditions are right. His return to that desk felt electric. Fans will find him, in broad strokes, anyway, strikingly unchanged. He remains extremely funny, energetic, precise and adept at inflecting a single bit with multiple meanings just by mugging at the camera. He looks good, despite several self-deprecating bits about how much he’s aged (which he deployed in the service of a larger argument about President Biden’s mental capacity, and whether discussing it was fair game). And while he can hit an easy setup out of the park, he’s still best in class at a sly mode of argumentation that catches the viewer unawares, from an angle they don’t quite expect. His insistence that Biden’s competence is fair game, for instance — which Stewart paraphrases as a failure to remember details while being deposed — set up a series of clips of various Trumps claiming, in depositions, that they just couldn’t remember.\n\nHe also remains committed to his signature “plague on both your houses” approach to political commentary — one that cemented his appeal as a fair-minded truth-teller in some quarters while also earning him eloquent (and persuasive) critiques. The sharpest of these was probably Steve Almond’s 2012 essay in “The Baffler” which, among other things, charged Stewart with championing a mealy-mouthed definition of civility that made “conversation” between opposing sides possible over heated but principled disagreements. Citing Stewart’s notorious, mega-viral exchange with the “Crossfire” co-hosts as the kind of exception that proved the rule — by demonstrating Stewart’s extraordinary gift for passionate confrontation and his deep reluctance to use it — Almond diagnosed “The Daily Show” host with an “aversion to conflict, to making any statement that might depart too dramatically from the cultural consensus and land him at the center of a controversy.”\n\nHe isn’t just warring with the media, or with the politicians he routinely skewered as a host, or with Trump, whose candidacy he delightedly mocked before decamping in 2015. He’s needling liberals for protecting Biden from scrutiny, leftists for insisting certain things are unsayable, and the electorate, generally, for caring too much about the 2024 election and too little about the everyday work of improving the country.\n\nIn general, though, he seems ready to advance a point of view (rather than settle for poking holes in those of others) and eager to stir the pot. That’s not exactly new: Stewart made waves when he appeared on his old friend Stephen Colbert’s show and endorsed the “lab leak” theory of the origins of covid-19 back in 2021. He maintained, in his monologue Monday night, that Biden deserved more scrutiny (rather than less) specifically because of the threat Trump posed, and that it was the job of the candidate (rather than the voters) to assuage concerns about competence. He took aim at his old network — specifically referencing China and artificial intelligence, the two subjects Apple reportedly objected to him covering. In his conversation with his first guest, Economist Editor in Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, he advanced the position that a global ideological realignment was underway along axes that had shifted from capitalism vs. communism to “woke and unwoke.”\n\nOpinions will vary on the accuracy of these assessments, but what’s clear is that in his first episode back at “The Daily Show,” Stewart is invested in mapping out his sense of the state of the discourse and his plans for his place within it. That includes the case against him, specifically, which was largely addressed through his special correspondents. Dulcé Sloan, in a bit where she insisted on standing outside the prototypical “American diner” many journalists reported from in 2016, refused to enter and ask voters what they think. “I know what they think. It’s what everybody thinks,” she said, which was that the public needs “more than just the same show with an older yet familiar face.” More pointed still was Jordan Klepper’s mock-hostile response to Stewart’s return, in which he accused him of brainwashing voters to accept the status quo by laughing at it when they could be out in the streets effecting change. Klepper derided his “’90s brand of snark and bothsiderism — George Bush is dumb! Al Gore is so boring! Wow. Searing, Jon.”\n\nJon Stewart didn’t just define political comedy for a generation. He made a particular orientation toward politics (and news) mainstream. In modeling a kind of cool and incisive, civil but skeptical outsiderhood that doesn’t work well with — or think much of — groups, Stewart fostered a community of cool kids who laughed along with him at the absurd political theater coming from those in power, but also — perhaps more damagingly — at any movement at all. (Most versions of civic engagement are, by dint of their cheesy slogans and sincerity, automatically and deeply uncool.) The biggest point the well-attended March to Restore Sanity made was how effectively Stewart had forged a community of skeptics who believed themselves above the humiliating homogeneity that membership in a political group (any political group) implies. Some group identities are acceptable. “Daily Show fans,” for instance, were cool. Democrats, in contrast, were not.\n\nStewart’s meatier response to his critics on this front was buried in the monologue — in an admonition that the oxygen and attention the election would inevitably consume should be tempered by sustained civic participation. Nov. 5 matters, Stewart told his viewers, but so does the day after. If the other guy wins, “the country is not over,” he said, and if he doesn’t, “the country is in no way safe.” What followed was an exhortation to eternal civic vigilance and tireless civic work. That doesn’t feel particularly coherent. It certainly wasn’t a repudiation of his contempt for cheerleading initiatives to get out the vote (for instance), which he mocked. But it does feel like a turn away from snark toward something that can brook the cheesy uncoolness that sometimes attends collective effort.",

  "text": "I get it. Life here is great, minor inconveniences notwithstanding. And it’s easy to find yourself down a fantasy real estate rabbit hole. Just like in the United States, houses for sale in Europe are listed on websites — for instance, Seloger in France, Fotocasa in Spain and Immobiliare in Italy — sometimes with appealing prices. But the process of actually buying one can get complicated quickly. Here’s where the experts say you should start.\n\nThe first clash between dreams and reality will come at the immigration office. Americans without an additional citizenship in a European country can only stay in the Schengen Area — a collection of countries that covers most of Europe — for 90 days in any 180-day period. Unless you’re planning to buy a home only for vacations (more on that later), you’ll need a visa.\n\nEven though there are some commonalities and agreements between governments, “each country has different laws, each country has different ways of doing business,” says Zola Szerencses, chair of the Certified International Property Specialists advisory group within the National Association of Realtors. The type of visa, its duration and the qualifications to get it vary as you cross borders, and some countries (like Switzerland) may have restrictions on where foreign nationals without certain visas can buy homes.\n\nWhat will be constant, however, are deadlines to turn in documents. Depending on the visa you’re seeking, you might need anything including birth and marriage certificates, a work contract and proof of a clean criminal record. “You have to not only just find these documents, but you have to get a new one printed from the state or the town and then have them send it off to get certified. And it’s just such a nightmare,” says Melissa Hughes, who bought an apartment in Spain in 2019. So, knowing what’s required ahead of time is key.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors has a database of internationally certified real estate agents listed by their location and countries of specialization. (Realtors certified to work abroad are identified by the letters CIPS.) Working with a U. S.-based agent who has expertise in your preferred country lets you “expect the same level of services and the same level of understanding,” as you’d get buying domestically, Szerencses says.\n\n“You cannot see everything in the picture,” Neill says. And not everyone stages homes in the way American buyers are used to — so, some international listings will require more imagination to grasp their full potential. “The first house I sold on my own [in France], that’s what I did: flowers, soft music, soft lighting, some bread baking and the house sold on the first visit,” he says. “But it’s extremely rare. It’s not done here.”\n\nOnce you find a place you like, the next step is usually financing (if you plan on buying in cash, you should research the property and wealth taxes in your new country … but then again, if you’re able to buy in cash you probably know how to navigate tax laws already). In certain newer developments, which Szerencses says are sometimes built specifically to cater to expats, financing is sometimes managed through the developer. Generally, though, a mortgage requires getting a broker and a bank. As in the United States, your international real estate agent can probably point you toward a mortgage broker and help set up a local bank account.\n\nLike visa requirements, the regulations around loans and bank accounts vary from country to country. Neill says in France, monthly income is more important than total wealth for most buyers to get approved for a mortgage. “You have people who’ve left their job, sold the house and moved … and they say, ‘you know, we’ve got a bag of money,’ but that in itself is not the way the system works here,” he says.\n\nWhen making the final purchase, lawyers and additional fees may also be required. In many countries, a notary will manage the sale, often for both parties, including overseeing the contracts and checking for liens. In France, for example, Neill says the notary fees can be about 7.5 percent of the sale price, though that includes taxes. The precise details of these fees will vary by country and agency — this is another area where an agent can offer location-specific guidance to avoid unwelcome surprises.\n\nJust like in the United States, the spending won’t stop after you sign the paperwork. You’ll need to pay taxes in two countries. The insurance you need will vary from region to region, and there are qualifications to get into national health systems. If you plan to hire workers to maintain your home when you’re not there, check the rates because labor can be more expensive in other countries. And if you aim to rent your European home, make sure you’ll be allowed to under local regulations before you buy.\n\nBefore planning an international purchase or move, it’s worth asking a few questions of yourself, too. “Over the years, I've had many people passing through and saying they were thinking of buying something, and the question I always ask them is how much time do they really want to spend there,” says Catherine Severo, my wife’s cousin who had a home in France for years and was a helpful guide for my own move. “Because owning a property is like owning a property in the States; you have to make sure the bills get paid, the grass gets cut, the rooms get painted.”\n\nThe romantic vision of expat life usually doesn’t include comparison shopping for vacuums or sitting with a dictionary and list of rules for how to set out paper recycling. But it’s worth taking the time to find out whether your desire for adventure can outlast the drudgery. “Come across for three months,” Neill advises. “Live with us.”",

  "text": "“The major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan to ensure the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there,” Biden said, referring to Israel’s publicly announced plans to invade the city. “Many people there have been displaced — displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north. And now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable. They need to be protected.”\n\nAbdullah was more direct. “We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to create another humanitarian catastrophe,” the king said. Referring to the war more broadly, he added: “We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end.\"\n\nThe joint comments by the president and the king Monday came after Biden met privately with Abdullah at the White House, the first face-to-face discussion the president has held with an Arab leader since the Israel-Gaza war began in October. The meeting came as U. S. officials have expressed deep concern about Israel’s plans to target the tiny town of Rafah, which borders Egypt and where about 1.3 million Palestinians are living in decrepit conditions after fleeing there under Israeli orders.\n\nDespite Biden’s growing willingness to publicly challenge Israel’s conduct of the war, he and his top aides have not publicly supported restricting aid to Israel or imposing conditions on it, as many of the president’s liberal critics demand. And while National Security Council spokesman John Kirby last week said an Israeli operation in Rafah “would be a disaster for those people, and we would not support it,” the White House has not threatened specific consequences if Israel proceeds with its plans.\n\nAn Israeli operation overnight Sunday in Rafah succeeded in rescuing two hostages, but it also killed at least 67 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, raising fears among Arab leaders that a sustained Israeli operation there could kill and injure thousands more. The planned Rafah operation has also escalated fears of a forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians, as Arab leaders fear they will be pushed into Egypt — a goal that far-right cabinet members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have openly embraced.\n\nAt a time when Biden has faced increasing criticism from Arab-American and Muslim voters angry over his staunch support for Israel and what they describe as a lack of empathy for Palestinians, Biden found a welcome ally in Abdullah. The president took the opportunity to highlight the suffering of the Palestinians, saying they are facing “unimaginable pain” and adding, “It’s heartbreaking. Every innocent life [lost] in Gaza is a tragedy, just as every innocent life lost in Israel is a tragedy as well.”\n\nJordan, whose population includes a large proportion of ethnic Palestinians, will almost certainly be key to any long-term American vision for the Middle East. Biden has said the war in Gaza must be followed by planning for a Palestinian state — a notion forcefully rejected by Netanyahu — and the United States believes that will require a thorough reform of the Palestinian Authority, which governs part of the West Bank. Jordan, which borders both Israel and the West Bank, would be central to any such effort.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has shown more willingness to take aim at the Israeli military operation in Gaza, last week calling it “over the top,” his strongest rebuke to date. But for months, Arab leaders in the United States and the Middle East have felt Biden’s public comments allowed little room for criticism of the hard-hitting military campaign.\n\nIsrael since then has mounted a fierce retaliatory campaign in Gaza, killing more than 28,000 Palestinians so far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. In addition, more than 80 percent of the territory’s residents have been displaced, and an Israeli siege has put hundreds of thousands of residents at risk of famine and disease.\n\nBiden and Abdullah have known each other for more than 20 years and have deep affection for each other, according to aides to both men. As vice president, Biden oversaw the Iraq portfolio for the Obama administration and made more than a dozen trips to the country. On each of those trips – either on the way over or the way back home – Biden stopped in Amman to visit Abdullah, Riedel said.\n\n“Abdullah can talk about all these issues in a level of candor that few other Arab leaders can because he knows Biden – they’ve been around together for a long time,” Riedel said. “I think he can be much more direct and candid. Part of the king’s objective here is to appeal to the empathetic part of Joe Biden and get him to show some empathy with the Palestinian people, which Biden needs to do for his own domestic political reasons.”\n\nThe conflagration in the Middle East, which has already spread to engage several Iran-backed militias in the region, carries the risk of significant political consequences for Biden. Arab Americans in Michigan and elsewhere are organizing to defeat him, and polls suggest that younger voters and people of color are deeply unhappy with his handling of the war.\n\nAbdullah’s trip to Washington is part of a tour to visit the United States, Canada, France and Germany, part of his effort to mobilize international support for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as well as the protection of civilians and for more humanitarian aid. Abdullah is also expected on Tuesday to meet senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as members of Congress.",

(Rhiannon Adam for The Washington Post)Before she developed long covid, Fran Haddock, 33, enjoyed birdwatching, foraging for seasonal plants and mushrooms, and enjoying the changing seasons. Her partner, Dan Kenny, 35, shares her love for the outdoors and often accompanied her on nature walks or trips to watch wildlife. But after becoming sick with covid in November 2022, Haddock rarely leaves her bed, and nature walks are a distant memory. Among her many symptoms, she experiences debilitating fatigue so severe that she can’t walk more than a few steps.Now Kenny brings the outside world to her bedside: flowers from their garden, freshly cut grass to smell, or foraged acorns and chestnuts to hold.“You have to reframe your thinking a little bit,” Kenny said. “We can’t really do much together anymore. You adapt, and you find new ways to find joy.”Haddock and Kenny aren’t alone in their struggles to adjust to a relationship that includes long covid. While much has been written about the physical toll of long covid, less is known about how the condition affects relationships.Common symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog and dizziness can make it difficult for someone with long covid to help with household chores, go out on dates or be physically intimate. As a result, experts say many long-covid patients struggle with strained relationships.Some have even started bringing their partners to doctor’s appointments, said Alba Azola, an assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Johns Hopkins University. “At times, I’m asked to be a mediator for some of the issues that they’re having,” she said.Many of the challenges couples face when one partner has long covid are similar to the challenges of any relationship, such as communication, sexual intimacy and navigating career and home priorities. But when one partner has long covid, how couples approach these issues often requires extra planning, compassion and compromise.Whether long covid also carries a higher risk of divorce or breakups isn’t known, but other research suggests that chronic illness can take a significant toll on relationships and can present additional financial challenges for couples. Experts say caregivers may report stress or feeling burdened. And sick or disabled partners may feel misunderstood or isolated.Long covid is also uniquely challenging for couples because of how much uncertainty it brings into relationships, said John S. Rolland, an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and author of “Helping Couples and Families Navigate Illness and Disability.”Because scientists are still learning about the condition and how to treat it, couples don’t know what to expect or whether their partners will recover.“It becomes a question of ‘When do we start to plan our lives as if this is not going to go away?’” Rolland said. “If every hope is put on a cure, what happens if the illness doesn’t go away?”With long covid, he said, people may focus so much on trying to cure the illness that they forget to maintain a healthy connection with their partner.Haddock met Kenny in 2008 in college, where they were both studying veterinary science, but they didn’t begin dating until 2012. Later they both began veterinary careers, moved in together and got a black cat named Salem. On their 10-year anniversary, Haddock proposed.But because of long covid, their plans to get married are on hold.While Kenny tries not to mourn what they used to be able to do together, he said it can be difficult to see friends getting married or having children — milestones that feel out of reach.“We feel like we’re just treading water,” Kenny said.To navigate her illness, the two of them approach everything as a team, sometimes joking that Kenny is like the body, cooking or doing chores while looking after Haddock’s physical health, and Haddock is like the brain, providing a positive attitude and checking on Kenny’s mental health. On good days, when she is feeling better, they cuddle in bed together and watch movies. On bad days, he holds her hand, or simply sits by her side.“Our connection has never really faltered,” Haddock said. “If anything, going through this has probably made us stronger, even though it’s a challenge every day.”Another challenge of long covid is that many who are sick may not look sick, said Elisabeth Nickels, a rehabilitation psychologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital.Because of this, some long-covid patients say they sometimes feel like their partners don’t believe them, or they feel pressured to “power through” their symptoms and suffer consequences later.Hinda Stockstill said her partner sometimes struggles to understand how sick she still is. The 37-year-old from Cincinnati got covid in December 2020 and never fully recovered. At her worst, symptoms such as crushing fatigue, body aches, and brain fog got so bad that she struggled to speak and get out of bed, and she had to take months away from her job as an office manager.Her symptoms have slowly gotten better over time, allowing her to sometimes make dinner for her partner, go out on dates or run errands. She has also started working remotely again. (Her partner asked not to be named for privacy reasons.)But her partial recovery created new complications. She still has setbacks, and her symptoms can worsen for weeks at a time. This whiplash confuses her partner, who has sometimes questioned why she can’t do something that she was able to do before.“I had to sit down and really explain to him that when I say I don’t feel well, I really can’t do those errands for you,” she said. “I try to see things from his point of view. He has never had covid and does not know what it feels like to be that sick. He only understands what I tell him.”Before long covid, Stockstill said she was an energetic person who played multiple sports, went to church every Sunday and volunteered for Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. She had dated her partner for only five months before getting sick.He’s “not hoping and waiting for me to go back to the person I was,” Stockstill said. “But my partner doesn’t fully know the person I was before I got sick, which makes me a little sad.”When she first got sick, Stockstill assumed that her partner would just break up with her. But instead, he arrived every Sunday to watch movies, cook for her and pick up medications. “He stayed with me through the most difficult part of my life,” Stockstill said.The loyalty and care he showed made her fall in love with him, she said.A third ‘person’ in the relationshipStockstill and her partner try to have days where they don’t talk about long covid. Otherwise, she said, it starts to feel like the disease has become a “third person” in their relationship. They do arts and crafts, watch movies and cook together.Rolland said these types of bonding activities help couples avoid forming a solely caregiver-patient relationship, which can make it more difficult to have romance and intimacy. He suggests that couples should limit the time they focus on the illness, and try to create separate rooms for caretaking vs. intimacy if feasible.For Stockstill, long-covid symptoms have also made it harder for her to get in the mood or feel sexy. Small acts of self-care, such as taking a hot bath, can help. She said intimacy often requires creativity to get around some of her physical limitations.“You have to find intimacy in other ways. If you can’t physically have sex for 30 minutes in a certain position, you might need to change positions, get sex toys or try something else more comfortable,” she explained.When her symptoms are worse, she and her partner focus on other acts of intimacy — giving each other compliments, cuddling or having him rub her joints with massage oils.Getting comfortable with intimacy can take time, because it requires the partner with long covid to relearn their body, said Bianca I. Laureano, a disabled sex educator.In addition to addressing emotional vulnerability or body confidence, long-covid patients also often report sexual libido, function or climax problems, Azola said. Studies also have shown an association between long covid and erectile dysfunction.Couples struggling with intimacy can look for a disabled sex therapist or find advice from other disabled people on websites like disabledparts.com.The initial shock of a sudden health change is often the most stressful period to navigate, Azola said. Over time, experts say, couples in which one partner has a chronic health issue can adjust and still have a healthy, satisfying relationship.After he developed long covid in September 2020, Sam Williams felt an immediate shift in his relationship with his wife of nearly 20 years. Crushing fatigue, dizziness and spasms meant that Williams, 51, of Okehampton, England, could no longer go camping, take long walks or do long bike rides with his wife and teenage daughter.“My wife found it incredibly hard to accept that my life was different, and I couldn’t do all the things that I used to do,” Williams said. “It’s like a whole new relationship.”Initially, Williams tried to push through his symptoms, but that just made them worse. With Williams unable to work, his wife found a higher-paying job to cover the bills and cost of their daughter’s education. She’s also taken on chores that Sam can no longer do, such as mowing the lawn or grocery shopping. (Williams’s wife asked not to be named for privacy reasons.)Williams helps when he can, he said, but still feels guilty and sometimes has struggled with depression or suicidal thoughts. “I sometimes sense my wife and daughter pitying me,” he said. “They know how little I can manage, and I see it changing the way they behave toward me.”He believes this shift in how he and his partner view each other has also impacted their sex life. They have been physically intimate only a few times since his illness, and the thought of intimacy prompts worries about worsening his symptoms.“It’s not necessarily about overcoming the physical barriers, it’s about overcoming the psychological ones,” he said.Just like any married couple, Williams and his wife have arguments. But long covid seems to exacerbate their issues. She often feels unappreciated, he said, while he feels misunderstood.Williams sees a therapist twice a month and chats online regularly with other long-covid patients, which he said helps him feel less isolated.Over time, he said, some aspects of his relationship with his wife have improved. They’ve gotten better at listening to each other, and Williams has learned to pace himself so he can go out for lunch or take short walks with his wife. They have also found joy in watching movies together with their two small terriers curled up on the sofa beside them.And just as his symptoms fluctuate, he said he has good days and bad days in his relationship.“The strongest feelings that I have are grief for the life I lost,” Williams said. “I’m not the same person.”Well+Being shares news and advice for living well every day.

  "text": "CDC officials acknowledged in internal discussions and in a briefing last week with state health officials how much the covid-19 landscape has changed since the virus emerged four years ago, killing nearly 1.2 million people in the United States and shuttering businesses and schools. The new reality — with most people having developed a level of immunity to the virus because of prior infection or vaccination — warrants a shift to a more practical approach, experts and health officials say.\n\n“Public health has to be realistic,” said Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Minnesota. “In making recommendations to the public today, we have to try to get the most out of what people are willing to do. … You can be absolutely right in the science and yet accomplish nothing because no one will listen to you.”\n\nThe CDC plans to recommend that people who test positive for the coronavirus use clinical symptoms to determine when to end isolation. Under the new approach, people would no longer need to stay home if they have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the aid of medication and their symptoms are mild and improving, according to three agency officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions.\n\nThe federal recommendations follow similar moves by Oregon and California. The White House has yet to sign off on the guidance that the agency is expected to release in April for public feedback, officials said. One agency official said the timing could “move around a bit” until the guidance is finalized.\n\nOfficials said they recognized the need to give the public more practical guidelines for covid-19, acknowledging that few people are following isolation guidance that hasn’t been updated since December 2021. Back then, health officials cut the recommended isolation period for people with asymptomatic coronavirus from 10 days to five because they worried essential services would be hobbled as the highly transmissible omicron variant sent infections surging. The decision was hailed by business groups and slammed by some union leaders and health experts.\n\nPublic health officials should treat covid differently from other respiratory viruses, she said, because it’s deadlier than the flu and increases the risk of developing long-term complications. As many as 7 percent of Americans report having suffered from a slew of lingering covid symptoms, including fatigue, difficulty breathing, brain fog, joint pain and ongoing loss of taste and smell, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile the coronavirus continues to cause serious illness, especially among the most vulnerable people, vaccines and effective treatments such as Paxlovid are available. The latest versions of coronavirus vaccines were 54 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infection in adults, according to data released Feb. 1, the first U. S. study to assess how well the shots work against the most recent coronavirus variant. But CDC data shows only 22 percent of adults and 12 percent of children had received the updated vaccine as of Feb. 9, despite data showing the vaccines provide robust protection against serious illness.\n\nCoronavirus levels in wastewater indicate that symptomatic and asymptomatic infections remain high. About 20,000 people are still hospitalized — and about 2,300 are dying — every week, CDC data show. But the numbers are falling and are much lower than when deaths peaked in January 2021 when almost 26,000 people died of covid each week and about 115,000 were hospitalized.\n\nCalifornia’s state epidemiologist Erica Pan said the societal disruptions that resulted from strict isolation guidelines also helped spur the change. Workers without sick leave and those who can’t work from home if they or their children test positive and are required to isolate bore a disproportionate burden. Strict isolation requirements can act as a disincentive to test when testing should be encouraged so people at risk for serious illness can get treatment, she said.\n\nGiving people symptom-based guidance, similar to what is already recommended for flu, is a better way to prioritize those most at risk and balance the potential for disruptive impacts on schools and workplaces, Pan said. After Oregon made its change, the state has not experienced any disproportionate increases in community transmission or severity, according to data shared last month with the national association representing state health officials.\n\nCalifornia still recommends people with covid wear masks indoors when they are around others for 10 days after testing positive — even if they have no symptoms — or becoming sick. “You may remove your mask sooner than 10 days if you have two sequential negative tests at least one day apart,” the California guidance states.\n\nHealth officials from other states told the CDC last week that they are already moving toward isolation guidelines that would treat the coronavirus the same as flu and RSV, with additional precautions for people at high risk, said Anne Zink, an emergency room physician and Alaska’s chief medical officer.\n\nMany other countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Australia, made changes to isolation recommendations in 2022. Of 16 countries whose policies California officials reviewed, only Germany and Ireland still recommend isolation for five days, according to a presentation the California public health department gave health officials from other states in January. The Singapore ministry of health, in updated guidance late last year, said residents could “return to normal activities” once coronavirus symptoms resolve.\n\nEven before the Biden administration ended the public health emergency last May, much of the public had moved on from covid-19, with many people having long given up testing and masking, much less isolating when they come down with covid symptoms.\n\n“You see a lot of people with symptoms — you don’t know if they have covid or influenza or RSV — but in all three of those cases, they probably shouldn’t be at Target, coughing, and looking sick,” said Eli Perencevich, an internal medicine professor at the University of Iowa.",

  "text": "“It’s a very serious problem with people crossing our border in a very unvetted, chaotic fashion, and it needs to be addressed,” Suozzi said at a recent news conference focused on the issue. He assailed Pilip and other Republicans’ opposition to a bipartisan border deal that collapsed spectacularly in Congress: “Everyone agrees that this is the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border that we’ve had in decades.”\n\nDemocrats recognize they are losing the border debate with voters, and some are trying to tackle the vulnerability head-on. In New York, they are running ads defending Suozzi’s border record alongside spots on a far more favorable issue for them, abortion. They are also criticizing Republicans for backing away from the congressional border deal over what some acknowledge is a political calculation — an aversion to handing President Biden an election-year victory on Trump’s signature campaign issue. Trump has derided the package as too lenient.\n\nBiden said last month that he was ready to “shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed,” if the compromise in Congress passed. The comments marked a stark shift in tone for a president who on his first day in office introduced a measure that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and whose aides once avoided describing the border situation as a crisis. But Democrats are divided, with activists and more liberal lawmakers pushing back. And even more centrist Democrats like Suozzi have found immigration to be a vulnerability.\n\nPlucked to represent the GOP while still registered as a Democrat, Pilip emigrated from Ethiopia to Israel and served in the military there before coming to the United States. She is battling critics’ suggestions that she’s untested — an argument opponents have ramped up in the final stretch with ads comparing her to Santos. She’s tapping into voters’ anger at prices, crime and, above all, the migrant situation in New York.\n\nStrategists often advise candidates to change the conversation as much as possible to the topics most favorable to them, and some Democrats are wary of spending too much time on GOP turf this year. But other operatives are urging the party to talk about immigration — in the same way many Republicans have advised their candidates to tackle abortion, their thorniest issue, rather than cede it to Democrats.\n\nDemocratic challengers to D’Esposito have already drawn attention to his opposition to the border deal. D’Esposito and other GOP critics have blasted the bill as too lenient and said that Biden could act on his own if he wanted. Some supporters of the bill say it’s all about politics now that Trump has turned against the measure.",

  "text": "In “The Taste of Things,” a radiant Juliette Binoche plays Eugénie, a gifted cook who for the past 20 years has been running the kitchen of a 19th-century epicurean named Dodin Bouffant (Benoît Magimel). As the movie opens, Eugénie is harvesting vegetables from Dodin’s garden, smiling beatifically and delicately rearranging wisps of hair as she clips lettuces for braising later; once at work on the day’s meal, she and her aide-de-camp Violette (Galatéa Bellugi) move with wordless, balletic precision amid Dodin’s simmering copper pots and steaming ovens.\n\nNo one breaks a sweat in “The Taste of Things” — they glow. No one swears or yells “Corner!” or “Yes, chef!” — they whisper, or simply deliver an approving glance of gustatory satisfaction. This is the anti-“Bear,” a sensuous fantasia of gastronomical pleasure less redolent of the Beef than “Babette’s Feast.”\n\nAnd, for a year rife with parlous politics and jittery culture, “The Taste of Things” is just what’s needed for some cinematic self-soothing. Adapted from Marcel Rouff’s novel “The Life and Passion of Dodin-Bouffant, Gourmet” by Anh Hung Tran, who earned his foodie-film bona fides with 1993’s “The Scent of Green Papaya,” “The Taste of Things” marks a welcome return of the good, old-fashioned art film that doesn’t dwell on the edge but instead rewards our need for escapism, in this case centered on bygone values of discretion, etiquette, noblesse oblige and beauty for its own sake. If such indulgence tips into its own brand of fetishism and complacency, well, that might be the price one pays for watching one of the screen’s most luminous actresses sizzle fish roe in butter, make perfectly shaped quenelles, prepare rooster combs with carrots and crayfish, and poach a turbot in milk, lemon and herbs, only rarely losing that Mona Lisa smile.\n\nThe sources of Eugénie’s private joy — and pain — eventually come to light in a film that evolves from what seems to be a conventional upstairs-downstairs drama into something more nuanced and unexpected. Dodin, modeled after the French author and culinary master Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, clearly adores and respects Eugénie, as do the friends who regularly meet in a sort of prototypical slow-food movement; when they moan and slurp while eating millet-gorged ortolans behind linen napkins, the scene resembles high priests worshiping in their own peculiar sanctum sanctorum. Meanwhile, Eugénie has taken an interest in a young protégée, Violette’s niece Pauline (Bonnie Chagneau-Ravoire), who is possessed of an unusually discriminating palate.\n\nBinoche is so gifted, she no longer seems to act anymore: She just is, in all her serene confidence and physical charisma, and “The Taste of Things” provides the ideal showcase for those ineffable gifts. The fact that she and Magimel were once a couple in real life gives the story what turns out to be an appropriately mournful frisson, and Tran films them in golden, sun-kissed light, swinging the camera easily between them as they compare recipes and menus. (The film’s sound design is equally luxurious, making sure the audience can hear even the gentle bumping of boiling eggs.)\n\nThe class striations of “The Taste of Things” are appealingly ambiguous, as the servants are shown to be connoisseurs every bit as sophisticated as the served. Dodin and Eugénie’s relationship, however, marks a subtle reversion to form, as it becomes clear that her value lies primarily in her ability to translate his genius to the plate. Plus ça change, as Dodin and his circle might say over glasses of wine in his flawlessly appointed dining room. Even when things stubbornly stay the same, though, they can taste awfully good.",

  "text": "One hundred and sixty four people have been killed and another 200 wounded across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The overnight operation in Rafah, a place that has largely been spared the widespread aerial attacks experienced in other parts of the enclave, shocked a bone-tired population that has spent months on the move, trying to outrun the bombs.\n\nPalestinian families are packed into houses and tents in Rafah; some newer arrivals are sleeping in the streets. They are almost entirely dependent on humanitarian relief, as aid groups warn of a looming famine, and disconnected from loved ones in other parts of the Strip because cellular connections are patchy and there is no electricity to charge most phones.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants ambushed Israeli border communities from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage. More than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military campaign, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and much of the Strip has been has been flattened by airstrikes. Israeli authorities say Hamas is holding the bodies of about 30 people who died in captivity or who were killed on Oct. 7.\n\nAfter Biden and Netanyahu spoke Sunday for the first time in more than three weeks, a U. S. administration official said the American position on Rafah had been made “very clear.” The United States would not support such an operation unless Israel has a plan for civilian protection and sustenance “that was actually planned, prepared and implementable,” they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with White House rules.\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said he was “deeply concerned” by the reports from Rafah. “All wars have rules and the laws applicable to armed conflict cannot be interpreted so as to render them hollow or devoid of meaning,” he said in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nPalestinian families who have moved repeatedly say each displacement is harder than the last. Food and water are difficult to carry. Children who have brought their favorite toys with them become inconsolable when they are left behind in the chaos. Communications challenges make it nearly impossible to know what awaits them in other parts of the Strip.\n\nAbove all, there is the question of where to go. A humanitarian worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said his family of five was running out of options. They had fled their home in Khan Younis in early December; now, they were preparing to head back, despite frequent attacks on the city.\n\nHe said they would be joining two dozen other relatives in his family’s one-bedroom house by the sea. The last remaining route connecting southern, central and northern Gaza — known as al-Rasheed or Beach Road — remained open, he said, though for how long he did not know. During earlier forced evacuations, some IDF-designated routes led civilians into the line of fire. Israeli forces have also arrested an unknown number of people at checkpoints along evacuation routes.\n\nBefore the war, Gazans who fit certain criteria could pay several hundred dollars to an Egyptian company to coordinate their exit through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The price has now shot up to $5,000 per adult or more, well out of reach for most families in the impoverished enclave.\n\nEven for the few who can afford it, the process remains opaque and uncertain. On Monday, the Egyptian company Hala posted a notice on its website saying that it was temporarily not accepting new applicants because its wait list was too long.",

  "text": "Gazans living in the overcrowded border city of Rafah are attempting to flee ahead of an expected military operation by Israeli forces, despite uncertainty about where to go next and dwindling resources.“We’ve been living in a state of terror for about a week now,” Anwaar al-Rai, 48, said in an interview Tuesday. Rai, who was traveling with her husband Mahmoud al-Rai, 49, and their two daughters, said she and her husband had been reaching out to everyone they knew in the western areas of Gaza’s central region, north of Khan Younis. “We urgently need a safe haven,” she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called last week for a “massive operation” in Rafah, citing the need to “collapse” remaining Hamas militant units in the last remaining refuge in Gaza. Israeli strikes in the city on Monday, part of what Israel said was an operation to rescue hostages, have added to the fears in Rafah. The strikes killed at least 67 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly warned against any military operation in Rafah if it puts civilians at risk. President Biden said Monday that Israel must have “a credible plan to ensure the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there.”\n\nRafah was previously one of Gaza’s last refuges, swelling to an estimated 1.4 million in population by early February, more than five times its prewar size. Many of those displaced have ended up in sprawling tent encampments on the city’s edges. The Washington Post spoke to several Gazans in Rafah who said they were trying to head north to Gaza’s central region, even though the Israeli military previously ordered the evacuation of that area.\n\nShadi Asaad, 32, said he was scouring charitable institutions in Rafah with his father, desperately seeking an additional tent. “I made the decision to move my family to the Deir al-Balah area,” Asaad said in an interview Tuesday, referring to part of the central region. “But with just one tent at our disposal, we require at least another.”\n\nTents have been provided free by charitable organizations. However, they are now being sold on the market for exorbitant prices and can fetch up to $1,000 each.\n\nRami Muhammad, 32, and his wife Najwa, along with their two children, found themselves displaced from their apartment near Qarara, north of Khan Younis, after the property owner sought refuge from Rafah. Muhammad and his family are now sharing a makeshift tent in Zawaida, farther north in the Deir al-Balah region.\n\nCIA Director William J. Burns and Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea met Tuesday in Egypt in a continued effort to negotiate a possible hostage-release deal. U. S. officials are hopeful that Israel will have a counter to Hamas’s latest proposal, and they believe that “the shape” of an agreement “is coming together,” a senior U.S. administration official said earlier.\n\nTwo Israelis were injured by rocket fire in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona, near the border with Lebanon, according to Israeli emergency services. A 15-year-old boy and a 47-year-old woman were wounded amid fire  between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, but is unusual for civilians to be targeted.\n\nThe South African government made an “urgent request” to the International Court of Justice to consider whether Israel’s planned offensive in Rafah requires the court to use its power to prevent a “further imminent breach of the rights of Palestinians in Gaza.” South Africa brought a landmark genocide case against Israel in December; in an initial ruling, the ICJ ordered Israel to do more to prevent the killing of civilians but did not call for a cease-fire.\n\nAt least 28,473 people have been killed and 68,146 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack.",

  "text": "It took many more years before he became a citizen, but once he did, he voted a Republican slate for the rest of his life. My mother broke ranks to vote for Barack Obama in 2008, by which time my father had decamped this mortal coil. I, on the other hand, had left the ranks of Republicans as a child, in that heartbreak year of 1968, when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated. A few years later, repelled altogether by the rigid binary of two parties, two racial categories, and the with-us-or-against-us polemic of Vietnam War defenders, I became a registered independent — a not unusual choice for Hispanics like me, impatient with the system’s lack of nuance.\n\nThere are a few realities we share. It is true that all Latinos can trace their roots to somewhere near or south of the Rio Grande. It is also true that most of us claim the mantle of Latinidad and say so on the census, whether we call ourselves Hispanic, Latino, Latina, Latine or Latinx. Sometimes we even speak alike. Often we celebrate “our heritage,” “our culture,” “our music.” Which might lead some to believe that we think alike. But, as Beltrán points out, we do nothing of the kind.\n\nThere is no Latino mind-set. Indeed, there are often stark differences of opinion among the major groups of origin, depending on age, religion and dominant language (Spanish or English). Mexican Americans and Cubans are often less approving of affirmative action quotas than Puerto Ricans, for instance. The majority of Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans say abortion should be legal, whereas Central Americans are more likely to oppose it. Defying widely held stereotypes, Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans, as dynamically different as they are, do not necessarily support “traditional” roles for women; all three are more likely than Anglos to agree that a woman is better off if she has a career.\n\nWhy do Latinos stay away? For many, a lack of interest in the voting process is simply a byproduct of disillusionment or distrust. Those who fail to participate may have emigrated from a country in which voter suppression is common. Or they are afraid to vote, reveal their addresses and call attention to the immigration status of someone in their household. Or they may feel that neither the red team nor the blue team represents them exactly — that a two-party system with no room for nuance doesn’t serve their slice of the American pie.\n\nThey could, for instance, be moved by the Supreme Court’s historic decision to dismantle Roe v. Wade. (One 2022 survey found that 82 percent of Latino voters support reproductive freedom, whether or not  they would choose abortion.) Or, they might be counted among the steady stream of Latinos who join evangelical churches every day and are encouraged to take their faith to the polling place. “Don’t just pray,” the Pentecostalist Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, founder and president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, tells a congregation of millions. “Register all the people in your church to vote life, liberty and biblical justice” — be a political force, in other words, a catalyst of change.\n\nSomehow, Libre, which claims to be nonpartisan, sidesteps the fact that Koch money has worked to defeat any hike of the minimum wage or further implementation of the Affordable Care Act — defeats that would be antithetical to what most Latinos want. As Latina Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) has pointed out: “The Kochs believe in a world with no Medicare; no Social Security … no public programs that support families when they fall on hard times. … The Koch brothers think they can buy the Latino vote. … But despite what their ads say, the Koch brothers are not advocates for the Latino community.”",

  "text": "One hundred and sixty four people have been killed and another 200 wounded across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The overnight operation in Rafah, a place that has largely been spared the widespread aerial attacks experienced in other parts of the enclave, shocked a bone-tired population that has spent months on the move, trying to outrun the bombs.\n\nPalestinian families are packed into houses and tents in Rafah; some newer arrivals are sleeping in the streets. They are almost entirely dependent on humanitarian relief, as aid groups warn of a looming famine, and disconnected from loved ones in other parts of the Strip because cellular connections are patchy and there is no electricity to charge most phones.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants ambushed Israeli border communities from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage. More than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military campaign, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and much of the Strip has been has been flattened by airstrikes. Israeli authorities say Hamas is holding the bodies of about 30 people who died in captivity or who were killed on Oct. 7.\n\nAfter Biden and Netanyahu spoke Sunday for the first time in more than three weeks, a U. S. administration official said the American position on Rafah had been made “very clear.” The United States would not support such an operation unless Israel has a plan for civilian protection and sustenance “that was actually planned, prepared and implementable,” they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with White House rules.\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said he was “deeply concerned” by the reports from Rafah. “All wars have rules and the laws applicable to armed conflict cannot be interpreted so as to render them hollow or devoid of meaning,” he said in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nPalestinian families who have moved repeatedly say each displacement is harder than the last. Food and water are difficult to carry. Children who have brought their favorite toys with them become inconsolable when they are left behind in the chaos. Communications challenges make it nearly impossible to know what awaits them in other parts of the Strip.\n\nAbove all, there is the question of where to go. A humanitarian worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said his family of five was running out of options. They had fled their home in Khan Younis in early December; now, they were preparing to head back, despite frequent attacks on the city.\n\nHe said they would be joining two dozen other relatives in his family’s one-bedroom house by the sea. The last remaining route connecting southern, central and northern Gaza — known as al-Rasheed or Beach Road — remained open, he said, though for how long he did not know. During earlier forced evacuations, some IDF-designated routes led civilians into the line of fire. Israeli forces have also arrested an unknown number of people at checkpoints along evacuation routes.\n\nBefore the war, Gazans who fit certain criteria could pay several hundred dollars to an Egyptian company to coordinate their exit through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The price has now shot up to $5,000 per adult or more, well out of reach for most families in the impoverished enclave.\n\nEven for the few who can afford it, the process remains opaque and uncertain. On Monday, the Egyptian company Hala posted a notice on its website saying that it was temporarily not accepting new applicants because its wait list was too long.",

  "text": "Nick Akerman is a former assistant U. S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and was a Watergate special prosecutor.The court trials of former president Donald Trump are well underway, yet aside from the Georgia RICO prosecution, it is unlikely, based on current law, that there will be cameras in the courtrooms for any of these history-making proceedings.\n\nThis, however, need not be the death knell for transparency. There is a simple way to provide the public with a direct view into the upcoming trials of the only U. S. president ever to be prosecuted for alleged crimes committed while in office: the daily release of the official word-for-word trial transcripts.\n\nTranscripts of trial proceedings are verbatim and contemporaneous records produced by court reporters for every court session, including pretrial conferences. These transcripts accurately record every word uttered by witnesses, lawyers and the judge. Trial lawyers use transcripts extensively as an accurate record that can be referred to while cross-examining witnesses, in final summation arguments to the jury and in arguing potential appeals. Most important, if, during their deliberations, jurors have questions about a witness’s testimony, the trial transcript can be read back to assist the jury in reaching a verdict.\n\nCurrently, there is no universal system for releasing such transcripts to any member of the public at no cost. A daily release of the transcripts directed by the judges from all the Trump trials would permit everyone to read an unvarnished account of what happened in the courtroom.\n\nIn the three Trump civil trials that have taken place to date — the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, her subsequent lawsuit for additional damages, and the New York attorney general’s fraud case — the media’s reporting has not exactly been a paradigm of transparency. The public heard or read only what reporters, most of whom have never tried a civil or criminal case, deemed significant.\n\nFor example, during the first Carroll trial, the public did not get a full picture of her case against Trump, as the media presented only certain highlights of her three days of testimony. The key issue, in that case, was whether Carroll was telling the truth when she described Trump’s alleged sexual assault at the Bergdorf Goodman department store some 27 years earlier. The complete transcript of her direct testimony and cross-examination, and that of supporting witnesses, would have provided a much clearer picture of why the jury found her credible.\n\nThe unavailability of transcripts for the two-month trial of the New York attorney general’s fraud case against Trump similarly created a black hole of information in a classic white-collar financial fraud litigation that demands extraordinary attention to detail. For instance, the credibility of Donald Trump Jr.’s testimony that he relied on accountants in certifying false financial statements requires a careful review of the trial transcripts to determine whether his testimony was supported by other witnesses or by business records.\n\nIronically, the one party in that fraud trial who appears to recognize the value of the public release of transcripts is Trump. On Jan. 4, weeks after testimony ended, Trump’s lawyers e-filed on the case’s public docket sheet the complete daily transcripts covering his defense, in support of his final motion to dismiss the case.\n\nSome practical issues would need to be addressed before any Trump trial transcripts can be released on a daily basis. These include accelerating the release of the official court transcript to minimize lag time from the actual testimony. And the court reporters who produce the transcripts must be compensated accordingly.\n\nThese are hardly insurmountable problems, and if the goal of transparency is to provide the public with as much accurate information as possible, as quickly as possible, the daily release of official trial transcripts is the best available solution.",

  "text": "During Sunday’s Super Bowl, a commercial for Baja Blast, the mystery-citrus-flavored, turquoise-hued Mountain Dew variety, featured one of the evening’s better examples of celebrity casting. It starred actress Aubrey Plaza, known for a kind of deadpan delivery and unexcitable stoicism that captures her millennial generation’s favored pose of existential dread. (I mean, they can’t afford to buy homes and the world is basically on fire all around them, so you can’t expect them to get all excited about a fizzy drink, okay?) And the twist was that Plaza was hawking a drink whose name suggests having the best time ever, which obviously is something she and her cohort are loath to do unironically.\n\nThe commercial featured Plaza in a series of scenarios that ranged from prosaic (a poolside party populated by unruly children) to fantastic (she’s being abducted by aliens), each time professing to be “having a blast” in a flat monotone that belied her black core of discontent. It concluded with a “Game of Thrones”-esque sequence in which she appeared astride a flying dragon alongside her former “Parks and Recreation” co-star Nick Offerman, and finished with an absolutely unhinged peal of laughter from Plaza.\n\nAs the Super Bowl spot drew eyeballs, meanwhile, the soda had been getting more under-the-radar hype from Taco Bell, the fast-food chain with which it is synonymous. Instead of airing its own Super Bowl commercial as it has in previous years, Taco Bell opted to host a trade-show-like gathering in Las Vegas the Friday before the Sin City-held game that was likened to tech and gaming conferences where the newest devices and products are previewed for their rabid fans.\n\nAt the “Live Más Live” event, there were trippy big-screen graphics, cameos by athletes and rappers, as well as remarks by Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant (who brought big dad energy when he shouted out DJ “LP Giobbi on the ones and twos”). But instead of futuristic headsets or microchips, the spectacle included previews of soon-to-come menu items — with a few Baja Blast-flavored offerings among those making the most waves.\n\nThe lineup consisted of a gelato that tastes like the soda, as well as a topping for its standard cinnamon twists that looked like tiny blue flecks. And most unsettlingly, the Taco Bell wizards also served up a pie bearing its recognizable color, a confection that looks custard-based and was described by those who tasted it as resembling key lime pie.\n\nTaco Bell has been testing the gelato in a limited market, indicating that it would likely be the soonest of the upcoming blue sweets out of the gate, but no dates were given for when the pie and cinnamon twists might be available for sale.\n\nSocial media lit up with the lime-flavored news out of Las Vegas, with reactions ranging from horrified to delighted — with a large portion of the Baja-curious populous appearing to be merely intrigued. “THERE’S A BAJA BLAST PIE WHAT,” was a sample response on X. “This sounds ridiculous,” one user posted on the Reddit board dedicated to all things Taco Bell. “I want to try this.”\n\nWhile Baja Blast might seem novel compared to more traditional soda brands, the azure drink actually marks its 20th anniversary this year. In its two decades, it has morphed from the kind of one-off product that Taco Bell is known for (RIP Tripleupa?) that quickly end up in the hinged-doored trash can of history into a bona fide phenomenon.\n\nWith a 2004 debut, Baja Blast is just a year younger than Starbucks’s pumpkin spice latte, another beverage that has evolved from breakout star to cultural signifier and has now graduated into ubiquity. Baja Blast might be a little more niche, but there’s reason to think it might not be far behind the PSL juggernaut.\n\nWhen Taco Bell first began pouring it from soda dispensers, the soda was an early example of brand synergy. Taco Bell was looking to up its drink sales, and the taco chain and Mountain Dew determined that there was a big overlap in their customers, according to a 2004 article in the trade publication QSR. “Over the years, Taco Bell has helped grow the Mountain Dew brand to the point where Taco Bell customers and Mountain Dew drinkers have become kindred spirits,” Dave Burwick, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Pepsi-Cola North America was quoted as saying. “They are active, energetic, and constantly looking for something they can call their own.”\n\nHow to explain its enduring popularity? It is visually distinct, with a color that is said to mimic the waters of Mexico’s Baja coast. Some call the shade teal and others have described it as neon green. One probably apocryphal story claims that Taco Bell execs dreamed up the idea for the drink while partying on a corporate retreat in the region, although the company has indicated that its origins might have been elsewhere, with rejected names including “Lime Zone,” “Cliff Dive,” and “Shock-apulco.”\n\nAnd then there’s that flavor. The QSR story describes it as having “a Mexican-inspired tropical lime flavor,” and Taco Bell likens it to drinking “an intense tropical storm.” Even ardent fans find it difficult to pinpoint what the “tropical” element is; some people say they detect notes of non-citrus fruit, citing blue raspberry (which does not actually exist in nature) or a generic fruit punch (again, not something you could pick off a tree). Many have suggested recipes for making the stuff at home that typically involve classic Mountain Dew, a splash of blue Gatorade or Powerade, and sometimes Sprite.\n\nTaco Bell and Mountain Dew have stoked demand by controlling the supply — a key page in the taco chain’s marketing playbook. Initially available only at Taco Bell locations, the soda was eventually released to retailers for limited offerings. This year, in honor of its 20th anniversary, Mountain Dew has said it will be available at retail stores all year long. And the brand has expanded: In 2013, Taco Bell introduced a frozen version, with a boozy take available at the chain’s Cantina locations.\n\nIt’s also been the main character in some viral moments. In 2008, a gamer plotted a heist described as “Operation Soda Steal” in which he would use a specially designed contraption that would allow him to surreptitiously siphon gallons of Baja Blast from the fountain and into a concealed tank, eventually making off with some partially flattened soda. And in 2018, a local news report in Alabama delighted the nation when a group of people planned to hold a vigil for the local Taco Bell that had been destroyed by a fire. Put together as sort of an over-the-top joke, complete with candles and (possibly faux) tears, the ceremony attracted fans, including one now known as “Baja Blast lady,” who performed an enthusiastic musical ode to the drink. “Baja Blaaaaaaast,” the woman boomed, before upping her voice to a register worthy of an operatic area. “Baja Blaaaaaast!”",

Writing about technology is my job, but I’m like most of you: I haven’t found much use for new types of artificial intelligence like ChatGPT.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.Maybe you love ChatGPT and use it constantly. Most people don’t.\n\nAbout two-thirds of respondents to a recent survey for Consumer Reports’ advocacy division said they hadn’t used an AI chatbot in the previous six months. A Pew survey from last summer also found most Americans had never tried ChatGPT.\n\nTech nerds may yell at me, but for many tasks, chatbots aren’t worth your time or the risk of catastrophic mistakes. You’re better off with simpler technologies.\n\nIf we use chatbots for the wrong things — like using a leaf blower to blow-dry your hair — we risk feeling disappointed in the technology.\n\nI’ll run through four examples to show what a chatbot can be good for, and when it may be the wrong choice.\n\nFor now, I recommend that most people start with Microsoft’s image-and-text AI called Copilot. (Until recently, the chatbot was called Bing. Maybe you saw that Copilot commercial during the Super Bowl.)\n\nCopilot is one of the most up-to-date versions of AI that you can use free. And Copilot is available to everyone on the web, iPhone or Android app.\n\nI used three different photos of my house plant. Microsoft’s Copilot got it right twice. It’s an aglaonema. The chatbot also described the image background though I didn’t ask for that.\n\nMicrosoft said that it is constantly refining the web results that AI chatbots rely on and that the company is committed to “improving the quality of this experience to make it a helpful tool for everyone.”\n\nWill previously published examples of how to get the most from a chatbot.\n\nOther people had success asking a chatbot to help write an obituary after providing an outline of the person’s life, or suggesting a rejection message after an awkward first date.\n\nLess useful: Chatbots make up information constantly. Don’t use any writing that a chatbot spits out without editing it. Don’t ask a chatbot for factual information, either. Search Google or Wikipedia.",

  "text": "Rather than being a forever commitment, marriage is typically only a temporary status of adulthood. With the current median age of first marriage at 30 for men and 28 for women, many Americans are unmarried for upward of a decade of adulthood before heading to the altar. It has become increasingly common for couples to divorce in later life. And in marriages that last, one spouse often outlives the other by several years; roughly a third of American women age 65 and older are widowed.\n\nClearly, the culture could stand to move beyond its fixation on marriage. One way: recognize those we deem the significant others in our lives — regardless of whether those relationships involve sex and sparks.\n\nOne woman I interviewed, Barb Buettner, who is in her 80s, told me that after an emergency surgery left her unable to have biological children, her desire to marry dropped off. Yet Buettner has not lived life alone. She has a robust circle of friends — chiefly, Inez Conrad, who has been her best friend for a half-century. Conrad got married and had children but eventually divorced. She moved to a new state to live near Buettner, who helped take care of her two sons. About 25 years ago, on the cusp of retirement, the friends bought a house together and merged lives, complete with a joint debit card and a shared email address.\n\nI’ve interviewed many dozens of people with committed friendships, people who tend to each other through tragedies and illnesses, providing the same forms of care and companionship that spouses typically do. Yet these platonic relationships aren’t widely admired for their mutual support and devotion. Instead, these people are often dismissed as “just friends.”\n\nThey’re also legal strangers. Joy Loughry, who took care of her best friend, Hannah Friedrich, during Friedrich’s six-year battle with ovarian cancer, was never entitled to family medical leave because she and Friedrich weren’t related. For the same reason, when Friedrich died, Loughry wasn’t entitled to bereavement leave.\n\nOr consider Anne Quinn, who raised three young children with her longtime friend Terry McKeon. During the years Quinn was the primary caregiver for the three children, she could not qualify to access McKeon’s health insurance unless she was willing to marry her friend.\n\nLegal changes could bring dignity to more relationships. The vast majority of U. S. states offer no form of legal partnership other than marriage. Yet for decades, activists have been calling for legal alternatives to marriage to ensure protection for people’s closest companions.\n\nSeveral legal scholars see a little-known Colorado law as a possible template for states across the country. Colorado’s Designated Beneficiary Agreement allows any two adults, regardless of the kind of relationship they have, to exchange important medical and financial rights and protections. State Sen. Pat Steadman, a principal architect of the law, deliberately made access broad because, he has said, “we didn’t want the designated beneficiary law to make the same discriminatory choices as the marriage code.”\n\nStates and employers could follow the lead of the federal government, which allows its federal employees to take leave to care for “any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.” Across the country, elected officials could repeal zoning laws that prevent unrelated people from living together.\n\nThese changes would not only assure protections for people in committed platonic relationships but might also psychologically liberate singles: If we could rid the culture of the idea that you’re not “complete” until you’re married, single people wouldn’t so often internalize the belief that their life, no matter how fulfilling, can’t truly be whole until they find a spouse.",

  "text": "The question now becomes just how much pressure the GOP senators have applied, and how committed the party’s foreign policy hawks are to compelling the House to act. The internal and inter-chamber GOP clash that was forestalled on the border security deal might well be coming on the Ukraine-Israel-Taiwan supplemental.\n\nThe Senate vote reinforced something that has been plainly evident: that these pieces of legislation in all likelihood have strong majority support in both chambers. To the extent they’re not going to become law, it’s because House Republicans refuse to allow a vote.\n\nThe Senate vote demonstrated that — in spades. Getting 70 votes on something major is rare in this polarized age. It received the votes not just of 71 percent of senators who were voting, but 46 percent of Republican senators.\n\nThe level of support echoed how the House has voted on Ukraine funding — the bulk of the aid bill — in the past. Every Ukraine funding vote in the House has received at least 73 percent support. Ukraine funding opponent Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) reportedly acknowledged Tuesday, “If it were to get to the floor, it would pass; let’s just be frank about that.”\n\nThat 2013 immigration vote might be the most direct comparison. But it was far less clear that the bill had such a degree of bipartisan support. Just 14 of 46 GOP senators voted for it. And even the bill’s Senate supporters backed away from pressing the House to act. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who faced attacks from the right for a deal he helped forge and sell, rather remarkably wound up telling the House not to pass or even negotiate with the Senate over his own bill.\n\nThe justification for the House not voting on this bill would likely be that it doesn’t have majority support in the House GOP, which is a key threshold that House leadership often uses. Republican support for funding Ukraine has gradually fallen since Russia’s February 2022 invasion, to the point where the last funding vote received 46 percent support in the House GOP — the same figure from Tuesday’s Senate vote.\n\nThere is already talk among Democrats of a discharge petition, in which a vote can be forced by a majority of the House — i.e. the vast majority of Democrats and enough House GOP foreign policy hawks. If a similar percentage of House Democrats supported the bill as Senate Democrats (just three on their side voted no on Tuesday), you’d need fewer than two dozen House Republicans to support a discharge petition.\n\nThis option is regularly floated but rarely invoked. It requires not just a majority of the House to support something, but enough members of the majority party willing to buck their own leadership in a very confrontational way.\n\nIt would seemingly remain unlikely. But if there were ever a time in which it would seem viable, it might be on an issue that its supporters feel as strongly about as combating a Russian invasion and at a time in which the power of the speaker is so diminished. GOP hawks could also pressure Johnson merely by threatening to go down this road.\n\nThere are other options on the table, including those GOP hawks forcing the issue by trying to gum up the works in other ways, such as through the rules process — a tactic the hard-right has used to significant effect.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), a supporter of the aid, has gone so far as to predict the House will ultimately somehow vote for the aid. He said, “The speaker will need to bring it to the floor.”\n\nAlso key is just how dead-set Johnson is against having a vote. He has voted against Ukraine funding in the past while expressing concern about accountability and the cost, and he drew a line in the sand this week. But he has also made a point to play up the importance of supporting Ukraine.\n\n“Now, we can’t allow Vladimir Putin to prevail in Ukraine, because I don’t believe it would stop there, and it would probably encourage and empower China to perhaps make a move on Taiwan,” Johnson told Fox News shortly after becoming speaker. “We have these concerns. We’re not going to abandon them.”",

  "text": "The prolific playwright Ken Ludwig wrote the door-slamming international hit “Lend Me a Tenor,” the book for the Gershwin refresh “Crazy for You” and, I kid you not, a joke involving a Hollywood starlet who thinks Marie Curie discovered the first antibiotic — and pronounces “penicillin” the way you’re really not supposed to. So, y’know, you’ve been warned.\n\nNow comes “Lend Me a Soprano,” a gender-swapped overhaul of Ludwig’s calling-card farce that’s being marketed at the Olney Theatre Center as a kinder, gentler sort of sex comedy, an update that centers the women in the story and for once sets the men to spinning ’round them. That it also dispenses with a blackface bit central to the plot of the 1986 original will prove a helpful refurbishment for a cash cow whose author would doubtless hope to keep earning those royalties.\n\nFarewell to that histrionic Italian tenor and the endangered production of “Othello” he’s meant to headline in 1934 Cleveland. Cue instead the histrionic Italian soprano Elena Firenzi (Carolann M. Sanita), whose nerves and appetites provoke alcoholic and pharmaceutical events that leave her performance of “Carmen” in jeopardy. Ask, if you must, whether the show will go on: Naturally, it will, though not without many a shenanigan involving an ambitious singing bellhop (Natalya Lynette Rathnam), a ruthless impresario (Tina Stafford) who’s gone full Bloody Mary at the prospect of canceling her sold-out opening night, and an eager-to-please opera-company assistant (Rachel Felstein) who has secretly been studying voice on the side.\n\nIs there a romantic subplot? There is, involving the singing assistant, Jo, and the impresario’s commitment-shy son, Jerry (Maboud Ebrahimzadeh), who’s sweet on Jo but who’s also been stanning the soprano since he saw her sing at La Scala. Will Jerry cheat on Jo with Elena? There are two identical Carmen costumes, so who’s to say?\n\nMore questions: Will the ambitious Dutch tenor (Tom Patterson, sounding hilariously like the Muppets’ Swedish Chef) successfully seduce the mantilla-clad Jo, thinking she’s Elena? Or will things play out the other way ’round? (Honestly, who can keep track?)\n\nAnd what of Elena’s wildly jealous husband, Pasquale (Dylan Arredondo)? Will he chase one or both couples around the suite, threatening mayhem? Of course he will, because apparently some stereotypes are less tired and toxic than others.\n\nThings feel a bit sweaty and effortful, especially in the early going — not the finest quality in a farce, though the cast may well settle into the show and tighten up its rhythms. And for all his undisputed success, Ludwig has always displayed more technical acumen than writerly genius; his shows work like sturdy timepieces, but their language rarely fizzes, their ridiculousnesses rarely evanescing into the sublime.\n\nBut director Eleanor Holdridge choreographs the chaos clearly enough, and “Lend Me a Soprano” does at least look awfully swell. Andrew R. Cohen’s stunner of a hotel-suite set, done up in a sumptuous cream-and-gold style that might be called late ostentatious, makes plenty of space for all the tomfoolery, and Sarah Cubbage upholsters both fools and fond-hearted lovers alike in evening wear suggesting the Great Depression never quite reached Ludwig’s Cleveland.\n\nTwo distinctly unalloyed pleasures: the moment when the Italian diva teaches the Ohio tyro a few tricks about how to really sing from the gut, and the moment when Donna Migliaccio — beloved veteran of both Four Mile Run and the Great White Way, swanning through the part of a daffy opera-guild dame — makes her entrance for the gala done up in flowing silver lamé and the inevitable tiara. “How do I look?” she demands imperiously. “Like the Chrysler Building,” her scene partner cracks.",

  "text": "For Abood Okal and his family, the nights are the worst — and each night is worse than the last. When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.\n\nOkal and his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son Yousef left their home outside Boston last month for a long-planned reunion with their parents. They were supposed to fly home on Friday. Now they don’t know when they’ll be able to get back to the United States.\n\nOkal’s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday’s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.\n\nAs Okal spoke over the phone from the home of his wife’s parents in the wee hours of Friday, there were at least eight audible explosions, with others in the distance.\n\nSleep is elusive. The bombs shake them awake, Okal said, and they find themselves coughing in air heavy with dust from pulverized buildings. He and his wife get up early, taking turns caring for their toddler and trying their best to pretend, for his sake, that everything will be all right.\n\nThe electricity is gone. The family is relying on a few solar panels, some batteries and power banks to recharge their phones and turn on a television for news. Their supply of milk and diapers is dwindling.\n\nThe market across the street has no bottled water left. Soon they will have to choose whether to risk going farther away in search of it, exposing themselves to more potential danger, or start drinking the water from a tank usually only used for washing or bathing.\n\nOkal works at pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb and lives in Medway, a small town southwest of Boston. He went to college in New Jersey and did graduate studies in Utah, where he developed a taste for snowboarding.\n\nOnce, when he was hiking in Zion National Park, he and a group of friends were trapped by a flash flood. After many hours, they managed to get out, but park rangers told them they were lucky to survive. Now that sense of visceral fear is with him almost all the time.\n\n“This is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,” he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. “I’ve never seen things on this scale,” Okal said.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have tried to get on a list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but they’re not sure if it’s functioning or if they would be turned back. When Okal’s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far — even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.\n\nIf his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws.",

  "text": "As the economy has improved, and consumers have begun recognizing that improvement, Republicans have pivoted to attacking President Biden on a different policy weakness: immigration. After all, virtually everyone — Democrats included — seems to agree the issue is a serious problem. But what if that premise is wrong? Voters and political strategists have treated our country’s ability to draw immigrants from around the world as a curse; it could be a blessing, if only we could get out of our own way.\n\nConsider a few numbers: Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released updated 10-year economic and budget forecasts. The numbers look significantly better than they did a year earlier, and immigration is a key reason.\n\nThe CBO has now factored in a previously unexpected surge in immigration that began in 2022, which the agency assumes will persist for several years. These immigrants are more likely to work than their native-born counterparts, largely because immigrants skew younger. This infusion of working-age immigrants will more than offset the expected retirement of the aging, native-born population.\n\nThis will in turn lead to better economic growth. As CBO Director Phill Swagel wrote in a note accompanying the forecasts: As a result of these immigration-driven revisions to the size of the labor force, “we estimate that, from 2023 to 2034, GDP will be greater by about $7 trillion and revenues will be greater by about $1 trillion than they would have been otherwise.”\n\nThe CBO is hardly the only observer that has highlighted the benefits of the recent influx of foreign-born workers.\n\nAs I reported in 2021, “missing” immigrant workers — initially because of pandemic-driven border closures and later because of backlogged immigration agencies — contributed to labor shortages and supply-chain problems. But since then, work-permit approvals and other bureaucratic processes have accelerated. Federal Reserve officials noted that this normalization of immigration numbers boosted job growth and helped unwind supply-chain kinks.\n\nOver the long term, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell recently said on CBS News’s “60 Minutes,” “The U. S. economy has benefited from immigration. And, frankly, just in the last year a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era.”\n\nNone of this is to diminish the near-term stresses on the U. S. economy that come from poorly managed flows of immigration. These challenges clearly exist, both at the southwest border and in cities such as New York and Chicago, where busloads of asylum seekers are ending up (by choice or otherwise). Absent more resources to manage these inflows and expedite processing either to authorize migrants to work in the United States or to return them to their home countries, this strain will continue.\n\nBut there are ways to harness the energies and talents of the “tempest-tost” and patch our tattered immigration system. Some of those tools were built into the bipartisan Senate border bill, which now appears dead.\n\nAmerica has historically drawn hard-working immigrants from around the world precisely because its people and economy have more often been shielded from such “Third World”-like instability, which Republican politicians now invite in.\n\nRonald Reagan, the erstwhile leader of the conservative movement, often spoke poignantly of this phenomenon. In one of his last speeches as president, he described the riches that draw immigrants to our shores and how immigrants in turn redouble those riches:\n\nReagan’s words reflected the poetry of immigration. Since then, the prose — as we’ve seen in the economic numbers, among other metrics — has been pretty compelling, too.",

  "text": "Before dawn on Saturday, Abood Okal and his family received the news they had desperately been waiting for. Okal and his wife and their 1-year-old son were finally offered a possible way out of Gaza — and back to their home near Boston. An email from the U.S. State Department told them the sole border crossing with Egypt “may be open” for a five-hour window later that day, from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Okal and his family went to the Rafah crossing only to find it closed. There were no officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing except for a few plainclothes security guards whose job was to keep people from getting too close to the gate, Okal said.\n\nThe U. S. government had negotiated a deal to allow American citizens to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt during the five-hour window, U.S. officials said Saturday. But Palestinian and Egyptian officials failed to communicate about opening it, an official at the border said. By the end of the day, no one had been able to cross.\n\nWael Abu Omar, the Palestinian spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said Palestinian officials had not had any communication with their counterparts on the Egyptian side. Egyptian media outlets reported that Cairo would only allow foreigners to cross the border if aid shipments could be delivered to Gaza.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has said it would strike any trucks coming across the border, especially trucks carrying fuel, according to a diplomatic official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nOfficials are discussing the possibility of setting up a screening mechanism that would allow the Israelis to inspect goods in each vehicle entering Gaza, the diplomat said. Another official familiar with the talks over the aid deliveries said any agreement would require “Israel to stop bombing the enclave for a few hours.”\n\nThe confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Rafah crossing comes as hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in response to an evacuation order from Israel’s military, ahead of a possible ground invasion into the besieged enclave.\n\n“We have informed U. S. citizens in Gaza with whom we are in contact that if they assess it to be safe, they may wish to move closer to the Rafah border crossing,” the spokesperson said, adding that “there may be very little notice if the crossing opens and it may only open for a limited time.”\n\nU. S. officials have spent the past several days trying to evacuate all U.S. staff in Gaza, a group of about 15 Palestinians that includes three U.S. government employees who work for USAID in Gaza, along with their immediate family members, according to a diplomatic official familiar with the situation.\n\nEach time, they’ve been stopped at checkpoints near the border inside Gaza and have been unable to leave. In some cases at these checkpoints, the diplomatic official said, people identifying themselves as Hamas have said none of them will be able to leave until aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip.\n\nCanadian officials also told citizens on Friday that the Rafah crossing might open Saturday for a five-hour window to allow Canadians to exit. Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters Saturday that the “latest information” she had was that “violence” in the area forced authorities to cancel the operation. She did not elaborate.\n\nOn Friday, Okal and his extended family had rushed south from  Jabalya in the north of Gaza after the Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate. They scrambled frantically to find cars to fit them all and a place to stay near the crossing.\n\nOkal, 36, and his family spent hours waiting under the hot sun Saturday. He said there were several hundred people there, including another American family from New Jersey. He said there were other foreign nationals too, including Canadians, Swedes, Spaniards and Norwegians.\n\nAs the day dragged on, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, took their exhausted toddler, Yousef, back to the home where they are staying with 30 other people, a short drive away. Food vendors near the crossing warned Okal that it was not safe to stay once the sun set. Still, he remained there until nearly 6 p.m., he said, hoping something might change. When he began to hear the sound of fighter planes and drones, he knew he had to leave the area.",

  "text": "Biden announced that a deal had been struck with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to flow from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million people face relentless airstrikes and an Israeli siege. Supplies of food, drinking water and fuel are dwindling by the hour. Despite the apparent breakthrough, Biden said the aid would not start arriving until Friday at the earliest.\n\nConcerned that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a broader regional conflict, the White House has tried to assure Arab partners that it will use its influence to protect innocent Gazans. Conditions in the enclave — already one of the poorest and most densely populated places in the world — are deteriorating rapidly. More than 3,000 people have been killed by airstrikes. Local hospitals are collapsing.\n\nBiden spent a little over seven hours in Israel, where he was greeted on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two men — whose decades-long relationship has been tested this year — shared a brief hug. Biden spent more than two hours at a meeting of the Israeli war cabinet before speaking with survivors of the attacks and families of victims and hostages.\n\nNetanyahu emphasized Wednesday that Israel would not permit the transfer of any humanitarian aid to Gaza from its own territory, but said it would not thwart the delivery of supplies from Egypt, provided it was limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” — and so long as none of it reached Hamas.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday called on residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the town of al-Mawasi, the latest in a series of recent directives urging Gazans to move south, even though most have nowhere to stay. The United Nations has warned that the evacuation orders may violate international law.\n\nThere was little acknowledgment in the region of Israel’s denial of responsibility for the hospital strike, or of Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalizing ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”",

  "text": "Israel’s military said Marman and Har were both in “good medical condition.” They were transported via military helicopters to Sheba Tel Hashomer Medical Center in Israel, where the medical staff said their condition was “stable” and where they were reunited with their families.\n\n“I salute our brave warriors for the bold action that led to their liberation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. “Only the continuation of military pressure until complete victory will result in the release of all our abductees. We will not miss any opportunity to bring them home.”\n\nArmed Hamas militants were guarding the men and were also spread throughout the building, he said. A minute later, he said, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes; Israeli soldiers shielded the hostages with their bodies as other troops exchanged heavy fire with Hamas fighters.\n\nNetanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were with Israel’s military chief as the raid unfolded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting, the military said. In a visit Monday with the unit that carried out the operation, Netanyahu called it “one of the most successful rescue raids in the history of Israel. … A perfect operation that was perfectly executed.”\n\nIt was only the second successful rescue mission since the start of the ground incursion into Gaza in late October — on Oct. 30, the IDF rescued a female hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, in addition to 29 others who are believed to be dead, most of them killed during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMany of the families of the hostages and the thousands of Israelis who have joined them in street protests have called on the government to agree to a deal with Hamas to exchange hostages for prisoners, believing it is the only way to guarantee the safety of their loved ones and questioning whether military operations are a realistic strategy on a larger scale.\n\n“We commend the IDF soldiers who demonstrated strength and bravery to secure the release of the two hostages, and wish them all to return home safely and speedily,” said a statement Monday by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing most of the families.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei lauded the rescue operation Monday morning and said in a social media post that in a meeting with Netanyahu last week in Jerusalem, he requested “the release of every one of the Argentine hostages” and continued to “maintain his condemnation of Hamas terrorism.”\n\nThe operation came hours after Netanyahu spoke on the phone with President Biden, who warned that an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah without appropriate accommodations for the civilian population would be seen as unacceptable to the United States, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nOn Monday, it remained unclear how the rescue — lasting about an hour and limited in its scope — would affect Israel’s broader plans for a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, where it says Hamas’s top leaders are hiding, using the remaining hostages as shields.\n\nEgypt has reinforced its border, signaling that it would not accept an exodus of refugees fleeing the fighting. It has warned that an Israeli invasion of the area along its border could endanger the countries’ 1979 peace treaty that has for decades stabilized the region.\n\nThe rescue operation was carried out amid negotiations to return the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as a halt in the fighting. Senior American, Egyptian and Qatari officials are expected to convene in Cairo on Tuesday; it is still unclear if Israel will send a delegation.\n\nDavid Tsur, former head of Yamam, the special counterterrorism unit that was among the agencies involved in the overnight mission, said that because the talks have been so far unsuccessful, the Israeli army took advantage of the “very short window of opportunity” to free the hostages. But he said it will have consequences for future operations.",

  "text": "President Biden, perhaps the most emotionally pro-Zionist president in history, last week used his immense reserve of goodwill and credibility on Israel to do something no other president had: He laid down strong conditions on use of military aid. However, he deftly did not single out Israel for special treatment. Sign up for the Prompt 2024 newsletter for opinions on the biggest questions in politics“U.S. President Joe Biden issued a memorandum on Thursday requiring allies who receive military aid from the U.S. to provide ‘credible and reliable written assurances’ of their adherence to international law including international human rights law,” the Times of Israel reported. Israel will need to supply written assurances within 45 days or risk loss of aid. The report added, “The memo did not mention specific countries who would be held up to the new standard, but came amid increasing calls in the U.S. to condition aid to Israel due to concerns over its military operations in Gaza which were triggered by the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Hamas terrorists murdered some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 253.”\n\nNo one should underestimate the impact of the decision. The Associated Press explained, “Democratic senators on Friday called Biden’s directive — meant to bring breadth, oversight, deadlines and teeth to efforts to ensure foreign governments don’t use U. S. military aid against civilians — historic.”\n\nTo be certain, this marks a victory for progressives in the Democratic Party, who promptly praised the move. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, along with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), had vigorously urged the administration to act, called it a “sea change.” Biden’s decision helped ensure unanimous Democratic support to advance a Ukraine-Israel aid bill on Sunday.\n\nHowever, unlike the calls to single out Israel, Biden’s directive applies equally to all countries receiving aid. Biden plainly wants no part of the insidious double standard some want to apply to Israel. The White House argued that the executive order simply confirms existing U. S. policy; however, the symbolic value is profound. At a time when his stalwart support of Israel’s right to defend itself comes under fire from Hamas apologists, Biden maintains the difficult balance between supporting Israel in its existential war against Hamas and focusing on the plight of Palestinian civilians and a two-state solution.\n\nThat the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC,  breathlessly criticized the move to ensure human rights obligations for all countries speaks to how out far the pro-Israel group has drifted from American and American Jewish opinion. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s view that he can act with impunity is not shared by most Americans — or even many Israelis, who have been strenuously protesting his handling of the war.\n\nMeanwhile, left-leaning J Street praised the decision. “J Street has for years called for greater oversight and accountability over arms and materiel provided by the United States to other countries, including Israel. American assistance — even to our closest allies — must not be provided in the form of a blank check,” J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami told Jewish Insider. “This memorandum also confirms America’s commitment to ensuring that its partners and allies do not restrict or impede the transport or delivery of humanitarian assistance.”\n\nBiden also pressed on with intense one-on-one diplomacy. After his comment on Thursday evening that Israel had been “over the top” in Gaza, Biden engaged with Netanyahu on Sunday in a 45-minute conversation — unusually long by most diplomatic standards (and even more so given that no time had to be spent on translation with English-fluent Netanyahu). According to the White House readout, Biden insisted Israel make “credible” arrangements to protect civilians before launching a widely criticized military plan for Rafah, where civilian causalities could mount. He also pressed Netanyahu again to increase humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.\n\nBiden’s patient approach with Netanyahu over months has gradually transformed into a private and public pressure campaign. A Biden official told The Post that the leaders had “a pretty detailed back and forth on that.” The official reiterated: “The United States would not support such an operation unless Israel has a plan for civilian protection and sustenance.”\n\nA potential cease-fire deal remains in the offing, thanks to the intervention and persistence of CIA Director William J. Burns, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and other Biden administration officials. If a cease-fire (partial or final) pans out, hopefully soon enough to save the remaining hostages, it will be because Biden successfully managed to be the president most supportive of Israel and most effective at delivering “tough love.” Both are essential to the U. S.-Israel relationship and, ultimately, Israel’s survival.\n\nDespite domestic criticism from right and left on the Hamas war, Biden seems to have found the sweet spot that leaves him with continued influence over Israel and in good standing with the Israeli people and the opposition government that is likely to follow Netanyahu’s eventual ouster. Experience in foreign policy does indeed yield benefits.",

  "text": "But the report came in hotter than analysts expected, narrowly dashing hopes that the annual inflation figure would dip below 3 percent for the first time since early 2021. And as the Federal Reserve fights to wrestle inflation all the way down to a more normal 2 percent, central bankers know success is still just out of reach, potentially slowing the Fed’s march toward the first interest rate cut in years.\n\n“There are still a lot of inflation risks out there, even though we can enjoy the moderation,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group. “We’re being reminded that inflation is not this easy path down to 2 [percent]. I just think this gives extra reason for the Fed to just take their time.”\n\nFed officials — who have their eyes on multiple interest rate cuts this year — aren’t expected to make any concrete decisions based on the January data alone. Instead, they have been looking for more assurance that inflation is gradually trending down.\n\nDerek Tang, economist and co-founder at the research firm LHMeyer, said that with so much progress in the rearview mirror, the Fed’s main worry isn’t that inflation is going to start heating up again. Instead, the prevailing risk is that inflation stops falling and keeps the Fed from finishing its job.\n\n“What do we want to see? We want to see more good data,” Powell said. “It’s not that we’re looking for better data. We’re looking at continuation of the good data that we’ve been seeing.”\n\nPowell has taken a cut at the Fed’s next meeting in March off the table. Odds seem to be growing for an initial move  in May or June, as long as no surprises threaten the economy in the meantime. After Tuesday’s data release, forecasters appeared to lean harder toward a June cut.\n\n“I don’t want to put timing on it really,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told reporters earlier this month. “Later this year — if things evolve as anticipated — we would be able to start moving the rate down. I think that would be appropriate. But again, I don’t feel that there’s a sense of urgency here.”\n\nThe Fed sprinted  to hoist interest rates in 2022 and 2023, and officials say they soon will move to cut borrowing costs multiple times this year. The idea is that even though inflation hasn’t settled all the way down, the economy is stable enough for the Fed to take its foot off the brake. But Tuesday’s report was a reminder that it may take a while for the central bank to feel comfortable with the shift.\n\nAmericans’ feelings about the economy have been gradually  improving. Consumer sentiment — a helpful glimpse into people’s moods — jumped 13 percent in January to its highest level since mid-2021, according to a closely watched survey by the University of Michigan. The S&P 500 stock index also set a new closing record on Friday, and it has gained more than 5 percent in the first five weeks of the year. That could all be good news for President Biden, as the White House tries to sell its economic record ahead of the November election.\n\nBut for the Fed, the inflation fight isn’t over yet. A big reason is housing costs, which have been a driving force keeping inflation high for over a year. Tuesday’s report showed the shelter index — namely rent — accounted for more than two-thirds of the rise in inflation. Rent costs were also up 6.1 percent compared to one year ago.\n\nReal-time data shows that rents on new leases are leveling off, and the construction of tens of thousands of new units should bring more relief to the market. Still, it’s clear that overall inflation — and people’s own budgets — won’t come back into better balance without more progress on the housing front.\n\nOther categories saw increases, too, including car insurance and medical care. A narrower, closely watched measure of inflation that strips out volatile categories such as food and energy rose 3.9 percent over the year before — still higher than normal, but consistent with the kind of progress that Fed officials have seen over the past few months.\n\nTrying to quash price increases, the Fed has pushed interest rates to the highest level in more than two decades. Those aggressive moves were widely expected to yank the economy into a recession. But instead, employers have kept hiring, and consumers are still spending on everyday items and big-ticket purchases. All told, the economy continues to grow in ways that look more and more like a “soft landing” — an end to inflation without a painful economic contraction.",

(David Becker/AP)The Super Bowl that had it all — Taylor Swift in the stands, overtime on the field and Patrick Mahomes’s magic — was a hit with American viewers, too. CBS announced Tuesday that the game was the most-watched telecast ever with a total audience of 123.7 million people, according to Nielsen data. The audience eclipses last year’s 115 million, which set the record before this season. The demographics for the telecast were not yet available, but pop star Taylor Swift’s presence in the stands likely provided an influx of younger, female viewers. The game itself was also riveting, ending in overtime with a game-winning drive by Mahomes and the Chiefs, who beat the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22.The figure is the total who watched on CBS, the Paramount+ streaming platform, Univision and Nickelodeon, which showed an alternate telecast geared toward kids. The audience on CBS accounted for the vast majority of viewership with 120.3 million viewers.One caveat to the record is that several years ago Nielsen, the company that provides viewership data for linear television, began to count out-of-home viewing, introducing metrics for bars and parties. Total viewership numbers of sporting events have risen with the additional figure, making comparisons to previous years more difficult.The NFL continues to defy the trends of linear television, where viewership for big events has been declining in recent years. The Grammy’s this year averaged 12.5 million viewers, up from a year ago but a far cry from the show’s heyday. In 1984, for instance, it averaged 51.671 million when Michael Jackson won a record eight awards. The Oscars drew 18.7 million viewers last year, also up from the year before, but the show hasn’t topped 40 million since 2014.Thirteen of the last 15 Super Bowls have generated more than 100 million viewers.The NFL’s regular season viewership viewership was up 7 percent compared to last season, and several playoff games also set viewership records.Nobody handles the cruelty of losing better than Kyle ShanahanNobody handles the cruelty of losing better than Kyle ShanahanNo team has ever won three Super Bowls in a row.

  "text": "Bigger is better. For decades (some would say millennia), young people have moved to large cities because they are centers of talent, money and jobs. From an economic perspective, this has been a hugely positive trend. Big cities are innovation hubs. They have fast-growing economies because there are lots of benefits (and cost savings) to having so many workers and capital together in one place.\n\nBut the pandemic forced a major rethink of this “bigger is better” concept. Suddenly, living so close together had downsides, and many people could do their jobs remotely. Now, megacities aren’t dead, but they’ve lost some of their luster.\n\nMillions of Americans moved over the past few years. The relocators have been overwhelmingly people with college degrees, especially millennials with young kids, many of whom wanted more space for less money. There was a mass relocation from expensive coastal cities — especially New York and San Francisco — to lower-cost places such as Phoenix, San Antonio, Jacksonville and Charlotte.\n\nConventional wisdom would say this big relocation should have been terrible for America. So much talent — and money — left “superstar cities” for what the real estate world calls “second tier” cities, or small vacation towns at the beach or in the mountains. According to traditional economic thinking, this should bring years of lower growth and productivity, because highly educated workers and capital are spread too thin. But there’s reason to believe the conventional view is wrong.\n\nFirst, remote workers are still connected to New York, San Francisco and other big cities. Video technology is now good enough — and accepted enough — to enable virtual brainstorming and networking. People don’t need to live in the same Zip code to trade ideas and benefit from being near each other.\n\nSecond, America’s largest cities don’t have enough housing. This is a crisis. And it’s why, even before the pandemic, people were migrating to lower-cost locales, especially in the South. Millennials’ moves during the pandemic helped alleviate some of the urban housing crunch. The moves also freed up a lot of money. People who relocated can now use some of the money they were spending on high rent and costly mortgages to start businesses, invest or consume more.\n\nThird, many people relocated to what I would call rising-star cities. Phoenix (population 1.6 million) and San Antonio (1.5 million) were already among America’s 10 biggest cities. Jacksonville and Charlotte are both close to having 1 million residents. These places have much the same creative and energetic vibes that megacities have. There is no exact threshold of people or money that a city reaches and then magically starts providing that extra productivity boost. But it’s getting hard to argue that someone living in Brooklyn is more productive and valuable to the U. S. economy than someone living in Charlotte.\n\nWhat’s more, rising government and private investment in semiconductors and green energy is injecting more capital to places such as Phoenix and Austin. It’s a mistake to ask, “What city will replace Silicon Valley?” The ideal is to spark niche innovation across the country.\n\nAmericans are also generally happier with their jobs than they’ve been in decades. Many used the Great Reassessment to change careers and find higher-paying jobs that better suit their skills and interests. Those who moved or work remotely at least some of the time generally report better work-life balance, because they spend less time commuting. All of this can help boost productivity.\n\nThe pandemic changed society in ways we are only beginning to recognize and understand. It caused many people to take risks in pursuit of more fulfilling lives. Americans are opening businesses at rates not seen in decades. Growth has been surprisingly strong despite high interest rates. And there are early signs of a productivity boom similar to that of the 1990s. Productivity could be getting a boost from artificial intelligence, but don’t discount the impact of happier workers and, possibly, the big relocation.\n\nThis is not to say everything is rosy. Some people now regret their cross-country moves. And the housing crunches and hefty rent hikes that used to be a problem mainly in New York City and San Francisco have become commonplace across the nation, especially in Florida.\n\nBut the U. S. economy’s secret power has long been adaptability. This nation has emerged from crises stronger than many other places because American workers and companies shift faster. Now it turns out that remote work and the big relocation are extending megacity benefits around the country. Imagine an era of rising productivity — and better lifestyles — in many more locales.",

  "text": "The House is slated Tuesday night to take a second vote on a resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the surge of migrants at the U. S. border after failing last week to advance the measure that had been hyped up to conservative voters for more than a year.\n\nWith House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) set to return to Washington after receiving treatment for his blood cancer, House Republicans expect to succeed in overcoming three GOP defectors who sided with Democrats to thwart their bid to impeach Mayorkas.\n\nBut any GOP absence could imperil the bid, depending on the number of Democrats who show up for the vote. The first time around, the promise of political retribution never materialized after Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) left his hospital bed to cast his vote, leaving Republicans one vote short of the majority needed to impeach the first sitting Cabinet member in U. S. history.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has struggled to corral his razor-thin majority, called the failed vote a “setback.” If the vote is pushed later into the week, Johnson faces the possibility of a shrinking majority, pending the outcome Tuesday of the special election to replace ousted former congressman George Santos (R-N. Y.).\n\nIf the charges clear the House, Mayorkas is unlikely to be convicted in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Some GOP senators have already poured cold water on the effort, criticizing the use of what was designed to be a rarely used constitutional instrument as a weapon in partisan warfare.\n\nAs the proceedings against Mayorkas have progressed, opposition to the two articles of impeachment — “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law” and breach of the public trust — has grown louder. Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) joined Reps. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) and Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) last week to vote down impeaching Mayorkas on the grounds that it would open a “Pandora’s box.”\n\nEchoing the consensus among legal experts on both sides of the aisle, Gallagher argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the “manifest incompetence” outlined in the first article of impeachment “doesn’t rise to the level of high crimes or misdemeanors.”\n\nSome other conservative voices weighed in on the matter last week to offer support for Mayorkas, including the Fraternal Order of Police, and a bipartisan trio of former Homeland Security secretaries called on Johnson to pull down the vote.\n\nOver the weekend, Mayorkas called the allegations made against him “baseless” in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” and put the onus on Congress to address “a broken system” by legislating.",

  "text": "Speaking to journalists in London, IISS Director General Bastian Giegerich said that multiple factors represented “a picture of strategic instability and a new era of contested power.” He cited Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, China’s military modernization, the conflicts in the Middle East and military coups in Africa.\n\nThe IISS report also highlighted the intense destructiveness of war. In Ukraine, the IISS estimated that Russia has lost roughly 3,000 main battle tanks since it invaded in February 2022. Those losses exceeded the total of tanks in Russia’s active inventory before the war, forcing it to pull older vehicles out of storage.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO member states’ defense spending has risen to about 50 percent of the global total, the IISS report stated, a staggering proportion for a military alliance whose member states account for less than an eighth of the world’s population.\n\nThe new estimates of growing global military budgets coincide with repeated remarks by former president Donald Trump on the levels of U. S. allies’ defense spending. He said at one weekend campaign rally that he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO members who didn’t spend the alliance’s target of 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense.\n\nWhile the United States still accounts for the bulk of NATO defense spending, the London-based IISS found that non-U. S. members have collectively increased their military spending by 32 percent in the decade since Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, with most of the growth occurring in the past two years.\n\nLast year, 10 European Union member states reached the stated objective of spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense, up from eight the year before. All European NATO members hit the benchmark of allotting 20 percent of their spending to equipment, the IISS found.\n\nThe alliance has also been boosted by Finland, a new member as of last year and one with a large standing army, and by the likely accession of Sweden. Several large nations, including France and Germany, have announced long-term plans to boost spending.\n\nHowever, the IISS also noted that some of those countries, particularly Germany, remain far below the 2 percent GDP target. Just last year, NATO members rejected a pledge to ensure their defense budgets went over 2 percent.\n\nThe IISS also warned that inflation and economic disruption have blunted the impact of some of the increases in defense spending, while a spike in demand has run into the reality that “European arms production was not geared for wartime.”\n\nWhile the West is spending more on military budgets, so are Russia and China. And with lower costs and heavy state involvement in the defense industry, they often appear to be getting more for their money.\n\nRussia’s total military expenditure increased by almost 30 percent last year as the war in Ukraine ground on, the IISS reported, with the Kremlin now estimated to be spending roughly 7.5 percent of its GDP on the military. The country has significantly overhauled its defense industry since it became apparent it was not prepared for the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s total military expenditure was estimated at $108 billion in 2023, more than three times the expenditure by Ukraine ($31 billion). Unlike Russia, however, Ukraine has often been able to replace lost equipment with better, Western-supplied equivalents, the IISS noted.\n\nMilitary aid to Ukraine has become hostage to a bitter political divide in the United States. The Senate advanced $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine this week, but hard-right lawmakers in the House are expected to attempt to block it.\n\nLast year, China increased its defense spending for the 29th consecutive year, the IISS reported, though lower-than-expected economic growth helped ensure that its share of GDP remained below 2 percent. Beijing is in the midst of a military modernization program designed to create a “world-class” military that relies less on foreign technology by the middle of the century, the IISS noted.\n\nChina’s ambitions have helped spur military spending among its neighbors, with Taiwan announcing its largest military budget at $19 billion — or around 2.6 percent of GDP. Japan and South Korea have also boosted their military spending, the IISS said, partly due to threats from North Korea.\n\nThe United States remained the world’s largest military spender; its $900 billion budget in 2023 was greater than those of the next top 15 countries combined. But while the war in Ukraine has stretched the U. S. defense industry, the IISS found that spending as a percentage of GDP — 3.36 percent in the United States — was lower than in previous eras.",

  "text": "I understand and cherish the fact that pop music is a playground of identities where queens are free to play cowgirls, but I don’t want to play along with these two new Beyoncé songs. Released in the dim afterglow of a hacky telecom commercial that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday night, the paired singles — “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages” — ultimately served as an advertisement for Beyoncé’s reported pivot toward country music, a creative makeover we should expect to hear in full on her new album, tentatively titled “Act II,” due out next month. “Texas Hold ’Em” is the smoother, livelier song of the two. “16 Carriages” is slower, more solemn. But differences in tempo and sentiment aside, both songs feel dull, dry, unimaginative, unnecessary, unconfident and uncool.\n\nFor Beyoncé, that’s quite a first. The flagship singles from her two previous studio albums — “Formation,” from 2016’s “Lemonade,” and “Break My Soul,” from 2022’s “Renaissance” — each seemed to explode into our consensus reality, simultaneously speaking to the heightening tensions in our national mood while still asserting their own distinct sense of pop futurism. This woman is an auteur who knows full well how to make exciting, new, detail-minded, zeitgeisty stuff. These two songs are not that.\n\nIt feels as if they were released as a pair because neither could stand on its own. Made with steel guitar, a church organ and a string section, “16 Carriages” is a plodding ballad about a beleaguered working mother struggling to make progress through life’s drudgery (“I might cook, clean, but still won’t fold”), but as Beyoncé’s voice flutters from plight to plight, the song goes nowhere. Meantime, “Texas Hold ’Em” feels like a lower-stakes redo of the vivid country dabbling she did on “Daddy Lessons” back in 2016, a song about the pains of a challenging childhood. “Texas Hold ’Em” is about dancing happily in a dive bar, its banjo twinklings punctuated with shouty “Woo!”s and “Hey!”s that sound needy and cosmetic.\n\nTo be clear, there’s no reason to object to Beyoncé making country music. But it needs to be Beyoncé-grade. That’s what’s tripping the wires, here. Instead of stepping toward a new creative vista, she sounds like she’s simply tapping a new market. Also, why now? And who for? Why, as a self-branded artist-advocate for human rights, would she choose to immerse herself in a musical idiom defined by its sense of nostalgia and tradition while the world outside continues to burn?\n\nObviously, a huge part of her politics has involved reclaiming the Black roots of various American music forms, so maybe “Act II” will eventually make these questions moot. But until then, let’s not forget that Beyoncé — along with just about every other contemporary pop star who appeared at the Grammys earlier this month — has kept completely silent over the killing of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza. If anyone at the top of the pops happens to be interested in singing about this world we share, please giddy-up.",

His remarks shocked leaders on both sides of the Atlantic — and mischaracterized how the 31-member alliance works.Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.NATO member nations all make payments to cover the operating expenses of the organization, which was founded in the aftermath of World War II to help Western Europe counter the Soviet Union with help from Canada and the United States. But they don’t pay membership fees to remain in the alliance, so there’s no delinquency to speak of.Countries do, however, commit to spending at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense each year, with the goal of ensuring the alliance’s military readiness and deterring any potential attacks. The commitment is a guideline, not a requirement, that has been in place for nearly two decades.Last year, 11 countries met or exceeded that target, according to NATO statistics. The rest spent smaller portions of their GDP on defense. (Iceland, the only member state with no armed forces, is omitted from the data set.)Most of the countries that spent beyond the 2 percent mark either share a border with Russia or sit near the front lines of the Ukraine war. Trump’s insinuation that they’re not paying their share is false.Poland — which shares part of its northern border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and a long stretch of its southeastern border with Ukraine — spent a greater share of its GDP on defense last year than any other member state, at 3.9 percent.The United States ranked second, at 3.49 percent. But in raw numbers, the $860 billion U.S. defense budget is more than double that of all other NATO allies combined.\n\nOther member states spending more than 2 percent of their GDP include Estonia, Lithuania, Romania and NATO’s newest member, Finland, which joined the alliance last year. (It’s worth noting that most of the big spenders have national laws or policies that require 2 percent defense spending in accordance with NATO’s goals.)Countries farther  from Russia were more likely to spend below the 2 percent guideline. Some — including Germany, Italy and Canada — spent considerably under that target,  despite having large economies and GDPs topping $1 trillion. Others, such as Luxembourg, may struggle to meet the threshold because of the limited size of their militaries and defense industries.Trudeau told NATO that Canada will never meet spending goal, Discord leak showsMost NATO allies are spending a greater share of their GDP on defense than they were in 2014. That year, Russia invaded the Crimean Peninsula and annexed it, inflaming tensions in Eastern Europe and prompting NATO to double down on its 2 percent spending goal.At the time, only three allies were meeting that target. The number increased to seven in 2022. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February of that year, defense spending spiked in several countries.Poland again topped the list, with its defense spending jumping from 2.4 percent of its GDP to 3.9 percent. In total, Poland spent more than $29 billion on defense last year, nearly $12 billion more than it spent in 2022 and three times what it spent a decade ago. France, Slovakia, Hungary and several others also ratcheted up defense spending after the Russian invasion.Earlier this year, Turkey voted in favor of Sweden’s membership after months of delay.  Pending Hungary’s ratification, Sweden is expected to join NATO this year as the 32nd member, and has committed to spending 2.1 percent of its GDP.Some member states are spending more but have yet to exceed the 2 percent mark. Others have flatlined. But the pressure to ramp up defense spending hasn’t gone unnoticed.Following Trump’s remarks, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday pledged to meet NATO’s 2 percent goal. “That is urgently needed,” Scholz said. “Because as harsh as this reality is, we do not live in times of peace.”",

  "text": "Skip to end of carouselWe here at the Department of Data are dedicated to exploring the weird and wondrous power of the data that defines our world. Read more. The hearing-loss model — led by David Rein, a health-data virtuoso at NORC at the University of Chicago — teases out detailed geographic estimates from hallowed, top-shelf data sets from around the government, including professional measurements of Americans’ hearing from the National Center for Health Statistics, demographics from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and Medicare claims. (NORC had help from Johns Hopkins’s Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and Burness.)\n\nIf we set aside those groups and look only at people between the ages of 35 and 64 — people who have yet to experience most age-related hearing loss but are old enough to have been exposed to a lifetime of aural assault — we saw some new patterns. For example, hearing loss shows up most frequently in communities with more jobs in the natural resources, construction and maintenance industries, which makes sense given the exposure to workplace noise.\n\nGiven those associations, we weren’t surprised to see that areas with higher hearing loss tend to have higher rates of Republican support. After all, former president Donald Trump dominates the Republican Party and his enduring appeal among blue-collar, White and older Americans has defined American politics for almost a decade now. (Really! He came down the Trump Tower escalator in 2015, and it’s now 2024.)\n\nAmericans who have fired 1,000 rounds or more face three times the rate of hearing loss as those who have never fired a weapon, according to an analysis of 2011 and 2012 observations from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. It’s a bit lower once you adjust for age and other factors — probably closer to 1.8 times the rate.\n\n“If ever there was an epidemic in the hunting community, it’d be hearing loss,” begins former editor Sam Lungren in MeatEater, an outlet that embraces hunting but not the culture wars that often go with it. “When target practice is a way of life, it’s easy to become blasé about earmuffs. When that buck is about to get over the ridge, jamming in ear plugs is the last of our worries.”\n\nThat kind of heavy gun use ranked up there with diabetes, heavy smoking and prolonged exposure to very loud noise at work as one of the most significant risk factors for hearing loss in the 2011-2012 data. And it’s not a niche hobby. In 2011 and 2012, 13 percent of U. S. adults were heavy firearms users, meaning they’d fired more than 1,000 rounds, and nearly half said they were exposed to gun noise for their hobby or job.\n\nAnd gun ownership tilts heavily rightward. As recently as the early 1990s, Democrats were almost as likely to own guns as Republicans, according to the long-running General Social Survey from NORC (an organization that began as the National Opinion Research Center just in time to measure U. S. attitudes toward entering World War II). But a partisan divide has emerged with alacrity. In 2022, 52 percent of Republicans had guns at home, compared with just 28 percent of Democrats.\n\nSo, is it possible that the partisan gap in hearing loss is actually a gun-ownership gap? To know for sure, we’d have to map gun ownership, and we don’t have that data. But — and this might honestly be the most depressing fact we’ve learned in a lifetime of data journalism — we do have a very good proxy: firearm suicides.\n\nMost gun deaths in America are suicides, and most suicides in America involve guns. Academics have found gun suicide so pervasive and predictable that it can be used as a reliable measure of gun ownership in an area. While the impulse to kill yourself may be somewhat evenly distributed, guns are not. And firearms make suicide attempts much deadlier.\n\n“I see men who spent their whole lives that way who now are very aggressive about what they’re outfitting their children and their grandchildren with when they go into the same situation.” Turning the corner on hearing loss is “going to take time,” she said, “but I can see it happening.”",

  "text": "For Abood Okal and his family, the nights are the worst — and each night is worse than the last. When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.\n\nOkal and his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son Yousef left their home outside Boston last month for a long-planned reunion with their parents. They were supposed to fly home on Friday. Now they don’t know when they’ll be able to get back to the United States.\n\nOkal’s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday’s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.\n\nAs Okal spoke over the phone from the home of his wife’s parents in the wee hours of Friday, there were at least eight audible explosions, with others in the distance.\n\nSleep is elusive. The bombs shake them awake, Okal said, and they find themselves coughing in air heavy with dust from pulverized buildings. He and his wife get up early, taking turns caring for their toddler and trying their best to pretend, for his sake, that everything will be all right.\n\nThe electricity is gone. The family is relying on a few solar panels, some batteries and power banks to recharge their phones and turn on a television for news. Their supply of milk and diapers is dwindling.\n\nThe market across the street has no bottled water left. Soon they will have to choose whether to risk going farther away in search of it, exposing themselves to more potential danger, or start drinking the water from a tank usually only used for washing or bathing.\n\nOkal works at pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb and lives in Medway, a small town southwest of Boston. He went to college in New Jersey and did graduate studies in Utah, where he developed a taste for snowboarding.\n\nOnce, when he was hiking in Zion National Park, he and a group of friends were trapped by a flash flood. After many hours, they managed to get out, but park rangers told them they were lucky to survive. Now that sense of visceral fear is with him almost all the time.\n\n“This is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,” he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. “I’ve never seen things on this scale,” Okal said.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have tried to get on a list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but they’re not sure if it’s functioning or if they would be turned back. When Okal’s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far — even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.\n\nIf his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws.",

  "text": "If you were surprised by the two country-infused songs Beyoncé dropped on Sunday night, hold your horses — this isn’t her first rodeo. In fact, fans have long speculated that such a genre-shifting project from the pop icon was imminent: There was the custom Louis Vuitton fit she wore to the Grammys last week — complete with a ribbon tie, a studded leather jacket and a matching skirt, plus a Stetson cowboy hat. A source told Variety in 2022 that Beyoncé had recorded “country-leaning tracks.” Not to mention the Houston native has always repped her country roots: with her lyrics (“I’m goin’ back to the South/ … Where my roots ain’t watered down”), her past performances with artists such as Sugarland and the Chicks, her rodeo appearances and her western aesthetics in her Ivy Park clothing line. (“The Houston Rodeo is a gumbo of family, connection, delicious food and eclectic genres of music,” she said of the latter project’s inspiration.)\n\nAfter teasing new music in a Verizon ad that aired during Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, Beyoncé has dropped two fast-charting country- and Americana-inspired hits, “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages.” The singles are the first releases of her long-anticipated “Act II” project, debuting March 29 as a follow-up to her acclaimed Act I “Renaissance” album from 2022.\n\n“I anticipate that this album is going to take us in a direction that both refines and redefines what country is and takes country up to another level,” said Alice Randall, a songwriter, author and professor of African American and diaspora studies at Vanderbilt University. “That it deconstructs and reconstructs country. That is what modern sounds in country and western do.”\n\nSkip to end of carouselStyle is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here. Randall pointed to the impact of Beyoncé’s first country song, “Daddy Lessons,” a twangy single that many critics regarded as one of the best tracks on the star’s 2016 “Lemonade” album. In a historic and widely shared moment at the Country Music Awards, Beyoncé performed the song with the Chicks, who later released their own cover. And it is credited for influencing the “Yeehaw Agenda,” an internet movement to reclaim Black cowboy culture through music and fashion.But “Daddy Lessons” also exposed the deep divides that still roil the country music industry. There was an outcry from some country music fans who thought the song didn’t belong in the genre. And the Recording Academy seemingly agreed, rejecting the song from consideration in the country music categories at the Grammys. The events echo the barriers Black artists have often faced in the genre’s more than 100-year history — from Ray Charles to Lil Nas X.\n\nDarius Rucker, a Grammy-winning country singer with 10 No. 1 hit songs, has often recounted the resistance he met after stepping out solo from rock band Hootie & the Blowfish to pursue country music. “When I started doing the radio stations and stuff, I had people say to me, to my face, ‘My audience would never accept a Black country singer,’” Rucker told ET Canada in an interview last year.\n\nMusicologists speculate that the precursor to the plucked string instrument originated in Africa and arrived on American shores during the 17th century with enslaved people taken from West and Central Africa. “As I understand Black country music, it goes back to the arrival of the first Black child to an enslaved African woman in these Americas,” said Randall, whose upcoming book, “My Black Country,” chronicles the Black influence in country music’s past, present and future.\n\nIn her book, she examines the unsung roles of Louis Armstrong and Lil Hardin Armstrong on Jimmie Rodgers’s “Blue Yodel #9,” which scholars consider one of the most influential country songs of all time; spotlights Florence (Givens) Joplin as a lost foremother of the genre; and recounts modern-day contributions from the likes of Beyoncé, whose work has long echoed a commitment to honoring and drawing upon music legends and Black history.\n\n“To me, one of the greatest albums in the history of country music is Ray Charles’s ‘Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music,’” Randall said. Charles’s music experimented with jazz, gospel, and rhythm and blues before he released the acclaimed country album in 1962.\n\n“I think that Beyoncé’s album is a similar kind of moment,” she said. “She is going to do with this new album what Ray Charles did with [his album]. And I think she’s going to take it even further if the things she’s already done in country is any indication.”\n\n“I hope the country music establishment embraces this album and Beyoncé’s presence as we should have embraced Ray Charles from the beginning,” she said. (Charles wasn’t inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame until 2022 — though critics have often cited his work for reviving and introducing the genre to new listeners.)",

  "text": "Snowfall totals were generally rather light across the area ranging from trace amounts (no accumulation) in our southern areas to an inch to the far north and west. This will be our last update in this article.\n\n8:35 a.m. update: Things have behaved pretty much as expected this morning, with the rain changing to snow during the past couple of hours, but roads mainly just wet within a one-county radius of D. C. The snow will be briefly heavy in some locations during the next hour before tapering, leaving a light accumulation on grass for some.\n\nFrom Northwest D. C and I-95 toward points west, temperatures have dropped to 32-34 degrees. That hasn’t been cold enough for snow to accumulate on roads, which have been relatively warm in recent days. The snow -- in some places a mix of snow, rain and even some sleet -- is on track to taper and exit the DMV from west to east between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m. Temperatures should quickly climb back into the mid- to upper 30s thereafter, and into the 40s this afternoon.\n\n7:30 a.m. update: The transition from rain to snow, possibly mixed with sleet in some places, has reached a line approximately from Gaithersburg to Manassas and will continue to advance from northwest to southeast toward the Beltway and D. C. during the next hour.\n\nWatch out for sudden drops in visibility and possibly some slush on roads and sidewalks north and west of D. C. in Montgomery, Howard and northern Fairfax counties, especially the northern and northwestern portions of those counties as temperatures dip to around 32 to 35 degrees. Roads and sidewalks are snowier farther north and west (Frederick, Carroll, northern and western Loudoun, and northern Fauquier counties) where the snow started earlier and it’s colder.\n\n6:25 a.m. update: Radar shows a lull in the rain around the Beltway now. The rain has changed to snow to the west and northwest of D. C. in Frederick and northern Loudoun counties, and is now doing so in northwest Montgomery County.\n\nRain will change to snow from northwest to southeast across the DMV now through about 8:30 a.m. Temperatures will drop into the low 30s as that happens, with the best chance of snow accumulation on roads north and west of D. C. and I-95.\n\nSome will see the snow heavy at times with reduced visibilities, which could come on very quickly without warning. Precipitation should exit the area from west to east around 9:30 to 11 a.m.\n\nA departing storm should throw some wet snow at us this morning before departing this afternoon and leaving behind lots of wind. The rest of the week is relatively tranquil with a warming trend into Thursday and Friday before a chance of light precipitation on Saturday. Seasonably nice weather returns for Sunday and Presidents’ Day.\n\nToday (Tuesday): Early morning rain should gradually mix with and shift to wet snow from northwest to southeast across the area before ending between 10 a.m. and midday. Snow could briefly fall heavily between about 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., reducing visibility and perhaps causing some slushy roads, especially in colder parts of the region. The accumulation, mainly on grassy areas, probably ranges from up to an inch or two in our far north and west suburbs to a wet coating around the District and to the south. Skies clear and it becomes blustery in the afternoon but highs climbing well into the 40s should quickly dispense with any snow that sticks. Gusty winds also help dry us out as they blow from the northwest at 15 to 25 mph with gusts as high as 30-40 mph. Confidence: Medium\n\nThe start of the holiday weekend is tricky as a weak weather system rolls through. Saturday leans cloudy with scattered light rain and snow showers possible. No significant accumulation is anticipated. Highs are expected to range through the 40s. Saturday night could still see a rain or snow shower under partly to mostly cloudy skies as lows range from the upper 20s to mid-30s. Sunday and Presidents’ Day Monday feature mostly sunny conditions with highs in the upper 40s to low 50s. Sunday night is clear with lows in the 20s to low 30s. Confidence: Low-Medium",

(Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post)\n\nOn Monday local time, Israel carried out a round of deadly airstrikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 1.4 million Palestinians have sought refuge. The strikes killed at least 67 Palestinians, including women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nIsrael said its aim was to rescue hostages taken by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack. Under the cover of the strikes, Israel’s special forces freed two elderly hostages. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the operation.\n\nThe airstrikes touched off a wave of fear in Rafah, which has become a last resort for Gazans fleeing violence farther north. The operation has also raised questions about Israel’s strategy and drawn fresh international criticism over the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Miriam Berger breaks down this latest operation and what we know about Israel's plan.\n\nToday’s show was produced by Rennie Svirnovskiy, with help from Emma Talkoff. It was mixed by Sean Carter.

  "text": "LAS VEGAS — The last time the Kansas City Chiefs lost a game, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid engaged in a physical confrontation more intense than the Super Bowl bump seen around the world. It wasn’t as shocking, however, because the 65-year-old coach was the aggressor. During a Christmas Day home game against the Las Vegas Raiders, the Chiefs were such a desperate sloppy mess on offense that Reid called a fake punt play that didn’t involve Kelce. It actually worked. Punter Tommy Townsend threw a pass to the sideline for the first down. But Kelce was frustrated. He slammed his helmet to the Arrowhead Stadium turf. A staffer picked it up and went to take it back to Kelce, but as he lifted it in the air to alert the superstar tight end, Reid swatted it from his hand like a skilled shot-blocker. Then the coach walked over to a helmetless Kelce, scolded the player and ended the conflict by thrusting his right shoulder into Kelce’s left side. Unlike Sunday night, Kelce was the one who lost balance. Reid stormed away, and Patrick Mahomes tapped Kelce on the stomach to settle him.\n\nThe Chiefs went on to lose for the fourth time in six games, their most prolonged slump during this era of trophy hoarding. And Kelce-Reid I was just the most heated skirmish of a tumultuous holiday in which Mahomes humiliated his offensive line during a screaming sideline fit. The next day, many wondered whether all the feuding confirmed that they were, finally, broken.\n\n“He caught me off balance,” Reid said, intimating that slow-motion replays of the incident made it look worse than it felt. “I wasn’t watching. He was really coming over [to tell me]: ‘Just put me in, I’ll score. I’ll score.’ So that’s really what it was. I love that. It’s not the first time. I appreciate him.”\n\nIn the aftermath of a 25-22 overtime triumph that made even neutral hearts pound, Kansas City couldn’t simply celebrate a dynasty-affirming victory over the San Francisco 49ers. The conversation couldn’t end with a contemplation of the greatness of Patrick Mahomes, whose unlimited talent gains substance and nuance each season. Praise of the Chiefs’ stellar defense and magnificent roster management had to wait. And Kelce’s romance with Taylor Swift, a relationship made in pop-culture heaven, now came with a sidebar.\n\nMeanwhile, in our sadistically divided nation, the rest of America handled it quite unwell. Everyone is looking for their own disgusted view of the country in everything, and our grandest annual sporting event provided the perfect grievance canvas. If Kelce were Black, would the thug accusations be louder? If he weren’t a coronavirus vaccine endorser, would the crowd that does its own research scrutinize him so heavily? Somehow, a football player’s rage became as much a politically divisive issue as a societal concern about anger management.\n\nKelce was the first to do wrong, and when you get caught raging at the Super Bowl, it becomes more than a fairly typical football argument. It’s important to have a deep conversation about tempers and inappropriate, cartoonish masculine behavior. But this incident is not the Swiss army knife to carve out any greater point.\n\nSome of the extreme indignation has been akin to the wrath Kelce displayed Sunday. However, Kelce stepped back, collected himself, played his best football in the second half and helped his team win a third championship in five seasons. And Reid saw the bigger picture. He’s a coach who looks beyond flaws and enjoys managing complicated relationships. He often gets the best out of his players by embracing them as individuals without barking for them to conform.\n\nTragedy has taught him to connect in this way. He’s a father who has experienced the heartbreak of addiction with two of his sons. His oldest, Garrett, died of an overdose 12 years ago. Another son, Britt, was sentenced to three years in prison in 2022 for driving while intoxicated and injuring a 5-year-old girl. Time and pain have transformed Reid into a man who coaches like a father who yearns to keep improving his leadership.\n\n“He’s one of the best leaders of men I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelce said. “And he’s helped me a lot with that, with channeling that emotion, with channeling that passion. I owe my entire career to that guy and being able to kind of control how emotional I get. I just love him.”\n\nReid and Kelce have been together since 2013, forming one of the strongest head coach-star player relationships in the NFL. In college at Cincinnati, Kelce failed a drug test for marijuana and served a suspension for the entire 2010 season. Reid, who epitomizes tough love, has been a key figure in his maturation into a transcendent player who, at 34, projects to have a successful life after football, even if his relationship with Swift doesn’t last.\n\n“I’m someone who did some things, who might have been considered a loose cannon early in my career,” Kelce told me four years ago, reflecting before his first Super Bowl. “This organization does an unbelievable job of helping guys find who they are as a professional and as people, and we learn how to conduct ourselves with that.”\n\nStill, he stumbles. Or, in this case, he made Reid stumble. In football, there’s often an overzealous need to promote a violent game’s virtue. Listen enough to the waxing about the teamwork, discipline and attention to detail that the sport demands and how it molds boys to men, and you start to forget it is also a vicious and debilitating game with a 100 percent injury rate.\n\nThey aren’t all madmen. But they play mad out of necessity. It’s inevitable that kind of fire will get uncontrollable on occasion. It happened Sunday, but it also happened six weeks before that. And in previous seasons, the wunderkind Mahomes has been caught screaming at Reid and barking almost nose to nose with Eric Bieniemy, his fiery former offensive coordinator.\n\nBut this is a dynasty that can absorb confrontation, that can rise above the ugly side of football. It says something about the character of the Chiefs that they can show their worst and still find a pathway back to being their best.\n\nThe cameras didn’t catch Kelce apologizing and embracing Reid shortly after the incident. But onstage for the Lombardi Trophy presentation, you could see the love that both men spoke about afterward. Kelce hugged Reid from behind. The coach didn’t stumble this time. He didn’t ram his shoulder into the tight end, either. He reached back and tapped him to show his appreciation.",

  "text": "Former president Donald Trump said Monday night that he wants his daughter-in-law and one of his top aides to take prominent roles at the Republican National Committee as his team attempts to exert control over the party ahead of the November election. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.In a statement, Trump backed Michael Whatley, the chair of the North Carolina GOP, as the new chairman of the party to replace Ronna McDaniel, a longtime ally he has recently soured on, according to people familiar with the discussions. But Trump also said he would support Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, as co-chair of the party and Chris LaCivita, a top aide, as the top operating officer.\n\n“The RNC MUST be a good partner in the Presidential election. It must do the work we expect from the national Party and do it flawlessly,” Trump said in the statement. “That means helping to ensure fair and transparent elections across the country, getting out the vote everywhere — even in parts of the country where it won’t be easy — and working with my campaign, as the Republican presumptive nominee for President, to win this election and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe moves come amid Trump’s growing criticism of current RNC chair McDaniel, who is expected to leave her job after the Feb. 24 South Carolina primary amid Trump’s unhappiness over lagging fundraising and other problems. LaCivita has told others he wants to make widespread changes at the organization.\n\nThe 168 members of the Republican Party will have to vote on Whatley and Lara Trump, and LaCivita would have to be hired by the party’s leadership. But Trump’s endorsement makes the appointments likely to happen, longtime party observers say.\n\nThe plan for a Monday statement surprised some of the party’s officials, who have been negotiating a transition with Trump for weeks after he began telling others he wanted to push McDaniel out.\n\nTrump decided to move up his announcement, planned for after the South Carolina primary, “because it had all sort of leaked out,” an adviser said. “It was just to rip the Band-Aid off and get it all over with.”\n\nMcDaniel has not officially said she was resigning. A meeting of the party to pick new leadership is expected to happen in March.\n\nInstalling a family member and a top aide would probably give Trump far more operational control over the RNC and how it spends large sums of money in the election. The party has paid millions of dollars of Trump’s legal bills before he became an official 2024 presidential candidate and could do so again.\n\nLara Trump — who is married to the former president’s son, Eric Trump — weighed a Senate run and has been heavily involved in the former president’s political efforts in recent years. The co-chair salary is set by the RNC’s budget committee but is usually around $250,000, a party official said.\n\nMcDaniel, who is in her fourth term as chair of the RNC, was expected to serve until 2025 but has considered leaving for months. Her relationship with Trump soured over the Republican primary debates featuring his challengers this past fall, according to the people familiar with the discussions. Trump wanted her to cancel them and she declined.\n\nTrump and his allies were also unhappy with the lackluster fundraising record of the RNC, which had about half as much money as the Democratic National Committee at the end of December.\n\nBetsy Ankeny, the campaign manager for Trump primary challenger Nikki Haley, said in a statement Monday night that “Trump just announced he is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.”\n\n“Under Donald Trump and current RNC leadership, Republicans lost elections in 2018, 2020 and 2022, and now the RNC is effectively bankrupt,” Ankeny said. “Nikki Haley’s plan for the RNC? Blow it all up.”",

  "text": "Dear Miss Manners: As someone who doesn’t eat candy, I don’t know how to handle holidays like Valentine’s Day, Halloween and Easter, when co-workers and neighbors often give out small bags of candy. If they're handing it out to everyone, I'll often say something like, “Thank you so much for thinking of me! I don't eat candy, though, so maybe you could give this to someone who will enjoy it more.” My problem occurs when someone leaves candy on my desk or they give me a personal card with candy attached.\n\nI'd like to give the candy to a friend, but should I let them know that I'm regifting it? I don't want to take credit for a cute bag and candy that I didn't pay for, but I also don't want my friends to think I'm just trying to get rid of the candy, especially because I know they'll genuinely enjoy it.\n\nIt is true that secrecy is an important element of regifting. The original donor should not know that the present has been given away, nor the recipient that it was given to you and rejected.\n\nBut if you were to run around redistributing all these treats, wouldn't you be turning into a well-intentioned candy person who perpetuates the problem?\n\nBefore you conclude that the garbage can is your only polite choice, Miss Manners assures you that such small, edible tokens — we are not talking about 5-pound, heart-shaped boxes wrapped in red bows — do not quite rise to the level of serious presents. You are free to accompany the regifting with an offhand, “I can't eat this — would you like it?”\n\nDear Miss Manners: In groups, my mother tends to suggest things that someone could tell the others about: “Bill and Sarah have some exciting news!” or “Bob and Laura might be making a change soon, too!” This has led to more than one awkward moment when someone clearly did not want to talk about a situation, or else they would have mentioned it on their own. How to handle this?\n\nIf you cannot restrain your mother — and Miss Manners supposes that you have tried, only to be told that shy people appreciate being prompted — you can become her co-anchor. That would consist of saying, “We’re going to take a break now” while shooting a sympathetic look to her targets and beginning another subject.\n\nDear Miss Manners: If no one responds to your party invitation, are you required to let them know it’s been canceled? Very often, when trying to host a gathering, I get few, if any, responses. I am beginning to lose interest in trying to provide hospitality to those around me because of this.\n\nIf no one responds to your invitation, you are evidently not giving a party. Any who accepted can be told that it has been postponed. But while you are not obliged to inform non-respondents that the party has also disappeared, Miss Manners would advise you not to be home that night.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice. You can send questions to Miss Manners at her website, missmanners.com. You can also follow her @RealMissManners.",

  "text": "Adapted from two online discussions, here and here. Dear Carolyn: Someone I’m close to recently had a major relationship disagreement with their partner. They only disclosed the disagreement to me after it had been “resolved” with their partner and never directly asked for my input on the disagreement. I have some questions as to whether the disagreement was actually resolved in a fair way, or whether this person just kind of decided to live with their partner’s version of the disagreement. But my thought is that, generally speaking, people shouldn’t weigh in on someone else’s relationship unless directly asked. Do you agree with that premise?\n\nSay Something?: There’s always this: “Are you asking me what I think, or are you just sharing?”\n\nWhen the moment has passed, you can go back to it with: “I was thinking about what you told me the other day. Were you asking my opinion or just sharing? I erred on the side of shutting up, but it occurred to me that I might not have been helpful.”\n\nAs for your premise, I generally agree on shutting up, but it’s okay to account for human variety. Some people will ask directly when they want something, some won’t, some think they don’t want your opinion but really do, and some think they want your opinion but really don’t. The way to navigate any doubt is to ask what would be most helpful to them — and then don’t press it.\n\nDear Carolyn: I’m allergic, so I never grew up with dogs, never got excited by them — or any pet, really, not to pick on dogs. My husband grew up with dogs, and his whole family currently have dogs except for us. I take an allergy pill when I visit — their house, their dog, their rules.\n\nI just found out that they ask to bring the dogs when they come to visit, for the day and overnight, and Husband has said no, citing my allergy and not wanting dog hair in our house.\n\nI appreciate him looking out from me, but I’m feeling like the naysayer in something that is totally normal for them. Is there any compromise that still keeps dog hair out of my house? Thanks!\n\nThis system is working perfectly. 1. You’re not a “naysayer,” you have a physical condition that rules out dogs in your house. 2. You are already compromising by taking a pill and visiting their dog-hairy homes. 3. Your husband gets that and is standing up for you.\n\nI guess I’m wondering why you still feel like the bad guy, as if you need to apologize. Is anyone in his family giving you a hard time? Besides continuing to ask whether they can bring their dogs when they know you’re allergic, which is rude, if that’s what they’re doing.\n\nCarolyn: No one is giving me a hard time! In fact, they are all so lovely about it — and virtually everything else — I want to make sure I’m seeing all options and not just the “no dogs” version, since that has been my life up until now. I will count my blessings!\n\n· I’m someone who has apologized to a rug for tripping on it, but even I can see no reason to apologize for a medical condition.\n\n· Once upon a time, it was entirely normal for people NOT to bring their dogs when they went to visit people’s homes, although I suppose it may be more common nowadays. There’s absolutely no need to do anything differently or even to feel any kind of way about it.",

  "text": "I am often asked by friends, extended family, co-workers etc., “How’s your dad doing?” or, “How are your parents?,” especially after I return from a visit home. After years of trying to spin things more positively than truthfully, I’ve been defaulting lately to, “Not good” or “He’s worse; he’ll never be better.” These responses typically make people grimace or apologize. I certainly don’t intend to bring on this response.\n\nMy question to you: Is there a better way to answer this question honestly without being a real Debbie Downer? The people asking already know about his condition, so they aren’t expecting sunshine and rainbows, but I know that just because I’ve fully accepted how bad things are doesn’t mean other people want an honest answer from me.\n\nFollow up question: When people apologize regarding his condition, how am I supposed to respond? I usually shrug and say that I’m at peace with the situation, but again, this seems needlessly awkward and often makes me feel (and probably appear) callous.\n\nDaughter: I’m so sorry you are going through this. Do you perceive that statement as an apology? Because it is not. In this context, “I’m sorry” is an expression of commiseration and empathy. Your friends are saying “I’m sorry this is happening.” Because they are. (Occasionally, people delivering tough personal news respond to an “I’m sorry” response by saying, “Why? It’s not your fault,” and this is a dismissive response to a person who is trying to be kind.)\n\nDoes telling the truth about your father’s condition make you a “Debbie Downer?” No. “Woe is me, I don’t deserve this, every visit home is a depressing nightmare for me and nobody is stepping up to help” is how Debbie would spin her tale.\n\nYou suppose that your local friends and extended family members “don’t want” an honest answer to their polite queries, but I think they do want your honesty, even if the unvarnished truth makes them feel inadequate in the moment. You can encourage further communication (if that’s what you want), not by shrugging, but by saying, “Thank you so much for always asking about my folks. I really appreciate it, even when the news isn’t good.”\n\nDear Amy: When people die, are items their children (or grandchildren) gave them considered property of the parents, or are the items given back to whomever gave them to the deceased?\n\nExample: A grandchild gave grandparents a valuable item years ago. The grandchild slept in the house for a couple of days after the funeral. When they left, they took the item off the wall and took it with them. Also, one of the grandparent’s children visited the house and took some items that their sibling had given to the grandparent.\n\nWondering: This isn’t an etiquette question. It’s more about theft, really. The grandparents’ belongings are property of the estate, and should be left in the home until the estate is settled. The executor or administrator of the estate is in charge of administering the will and the process of dispersing possessions. The best way to divide possessions is with the heirs’ full assent and cooperation.\n\nIf a grandparent left her property to her children, ideally these children would gather in the house and peacefully divide possessions according to an organized system (my family used a lottery system). Yes, gifts given to the deceased are often returned to the person who gave them, but it is vital that the heirs agree to this.\n\nDear Amy: “Alarmed Wife” was concerned because her older husband was private messaging with a much younger woman on Facebook. Thank you for pointing out that this is likely a “catfish.” You didn’t suggest the ongoing ramifications of this, however. Catfish scams are popular, and they often lead to financial abuse.",

  "text": "“In the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters,” Johnson said in a statement. “America deserves better than the Senate’s status quo.”\n\nThe aid package has been long awaited by the White House, which requested the funds in October, shortly after Israel came under attack by Hamas. Republicans, including Johnson, demanded that a border security piece be attached to it in exchange for their votes. But they abandoned the proposal amid opposition from former president Donald Trump, who has made the border crisis a core campaign issue and has complained that the border reforms would help President Biden and Democrats.\n\n“These past few months have been a great test for the U. S. Senate to see if we could escape the centrifugal pull of partisanship and summon the will to defend Western democracy when it mattered most,” Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said after the bill passed in the Senate. “Today, the Senate has resoundingly passed the test.”\n\nBiden also urged the House to pass the bill. “If we do not stand against tyrants who seek to conquer or carve up their neighbors’ territory, the consequences for America’s national security will be significant,” the president said in a statement.\n\nUkraine funding has become unpopular among GOP base voters, and Trump said at a recent rally that he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO nations that he views are not spending enough money on defense. (NATO nations aim to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, a standard that 11 countries met in 2023.) Trump also explicitly opposed the foreign aid package, saying in a recent social media post that he believes aid should be given as a loan.\n\nThere are efforts underway to go around Johnson and pass the bill through a Democratic-led discharge petition. Democrats need to gather at least four signatures from Republicans supportive of Ukraine funding to be able to introduce the petition, which probably wouldn’t happen until the end of the month given the congressional calendar.\n\nIts path would still be tricky in the House, given that some Democrats have objected to the Israeli government’s handling of the war in Gaza, where most homes have been destroyed or damaged, more than 12,300 Palestinian children have been killed and a quarter of the population is starving, according to the United Nations. Enough Republicans would need to support the bill to make up for those Democrats who would not vote for the bill over the aid to Israel.\n\nBringing the legislation to the floor through a discharge petition — which requires 218 members to support it — would avoid Johnson having his fingerprints on the proposal amid calls by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and others to remove him as speaker if he puts a Ukraine funding bill on the House floor for a vote.\n\nIn addition to the $60 billion for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel, the national security legislation also includes more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza, Ukraine and other nations; spends nearly $5 billion on Indo-Pacific allies, including Taiwan; and prohibits any of the bill’s humanitarian funds from going to the U. N. Relief and Works Agency that operates in Gaza and the West Bank, following allegations that some of its employees were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nGOP senators have been fighting with each other for weeks over the package, with some critics arguing that McConnell led them into a political box in which Democrats have claimed the edge on border security after the GOP defected from the border deal that the generally pro-Republican Border Patrol union endorsed.\n\n“Why did Republicans stab their voters in their back?” Sen. J. D. Vance (R-Ohio) asked Monday on the Senate floor, referring to the decision to vote for the package without securing the southern border. (Vance, along with almost every Republican, voted against the border security component last week.)\n\nA vocal faction of McConnell critics has grown louder over the past several days, with a handful even calling for his ouster, as Senate Republicans gathered in meeting after meeting arguing about the uncomfortable political situation in which they find themselves. “Clearly there is more objection to foreign involvement in the Senate now than there used to be,” McConnell told The Post in an interview last week. But he said he was “willing to take the heat” to force the politically divisive issue.",

Willis (D) engaged in an improper personal relationship with the lead prosecutor on the election interference case, his lawyer announced Tuesday. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.“President Trump will be attending court in New York on Thursday,” Steve Sadow said in an email to reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the former president was considering attending the hearing and skipping a separate appearance in the New York case, according to two individuals who were familiar with the plan and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss it. In the New York case, Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.\n\nIt’s not known what scuttled the idea — nor why Trump wanted to attend the Georgia hearing. The possibility raised questions about how a visit to the Fulton County Courthouse could have caused a chaotic scene in downtown Atlanta and in the courtroom of Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case. At the hearing, Willis will likely face having her personal life and professional integrity scrutinized and questioned.\n\nCourtrooms have in many ways become campaign stops for Trump as he runs for the Republican presidential nomination while facing 91 felony charges across four cases. By casting these charges as political persecution and attacking the prosecutors and judges involved, Trump has galvanized Republican support for his candidacy.\n\nMcAfee ruled Monday that the hearing would continue over Willis’s objections because an actual conflict or appearance of one is grounds for disqualifying Willis from the case. McAfee said the hearing would focus on whether Willis benefited financially from hiring Nathan Wade, when their romantic relationship began and whether it continues.\n\nMcAfee’s decision came more than a month after Mike Roman, one of the former president’s co-defendants who worked on Trump’s 2020 campaign, claimed in a court filing that Willis and Wade had been involved in an “improper, clandestine personal relationship” that has financially benefited them both.\n\nRoman’s lawyer, Ashleigh Merchant, claimed Willis may have broken the law by hiring Wade and then allowing him to pay for “vacations across the world” with her that were unrelated to their work on the case. Roman’s filing, which offered no proof to substantiate the sensational claims, called for the prosecutors to be disqualified and for the charges against him to be dismissed.\n\nRoman’s motion to disqualify Willis and her office was later joined by Trump and several other co-defendants, including former Georgia GOP chairman David Shafer, Atlanta area attorney Bob Cheeley, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Cathleen Latham, a 2020 Trump elector.",

  "text": "The Michigan House of Representatives stripped Republican lawmaker Josh Schriver of his staff members and a committee position on Monday, days after Schriver posted online about a racist conspiracy theory. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.Schriver sparked furor last week when he shared a post on social media of an image captioned, “The great replacement!” The image referenced the far-right conspiracy theory that non-White immigrants are deliberately brought into White-majority countries to undermine the political power and cultures of White people.\n\nMichigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D) announced the sanctions Monday morning and accused Schriver of promoting a “sustained campaign of racist rhetoric and hate speech.” Schriver doubled down on his post Monday evening, denying that sharing the image was racist.\n\n“I’m not (and never have been) a racist,” Schriver wrote. “So I cannot offer a fake political apology for views I don’t hold.”\n\nSchriver, who was elected in November 2022 to represent parts of Macomb and Oakland counties in the Michigan House’s 66th District, will be removed from a position on the House Natural Resources, Environment, Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee, though he will still be able to cast votes in the House, Tate announced. Schriver’s office staff will be reassigned.\n\nTate said he punished Schriver to ensure the safety and security of House staffers.\n\n“Representative Schriver has a history of promoting debunked theories and dangerous rhetoric that jeopardizes the safety of Michigan residents and contributes to a hostile and uncomfortable environment for others,” Tate said.\n\nThe “great replacement theory” referenced by Schriver, once a fringe term largely associated with white nationalists, slowly entered the political mainstream after being increasingly embraced by Republican politicians to stoke fears about immigration, election integrity and border security. The conspiracy theory has inspired horrific violence in the past several years, and mass shooters — specifically in Buffalo and El Paso — have cited it as a reason for targeting communities of color.\n\nSchriver on Tuesday shared a crude illustration of the conspiracy theory, depicting a map of the world with small groups of White figures in North America, Europe and Australia surrounded by Black figures across the rest of the planet.\n\nState politicians on both sides of the aisle criticized the posts. Tate and two Republican colleagues, Rep. Donni Steele and Sen. John Damoose issued statements condemning the post as racist. They were joined by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II (D).\n\n“The abhorrent rhetoric pushed by a member of the Michigan House of Representatives goes against our state and national values,” Whitmer said in a statement. “We have a moral obligation to speak out against hatred.”\n\nAs Schriver’s colleagues spoke out, he appeared to reaffirm his invocation. “What did I tweet that was false?” he wrote, alleging in follow-up posts that the denouncements against him were signs of an “anti-white agenda.”",

  "text": "Hi, Elaine: I had a friendship of 50 years that ended abruptly, though my ex-friend had often said that she hoped we could be friends forever and that she felt like we were sisters. The breakup, which ended by her ghosting me, was due to her saying, “You always criticize me.” I didn’t think I ever did, but I asked her for an example. She refused.\n\nWe continued on as usual, but her comment bothered me, so I asked her again for an example. She responded by ghosting. Does this happen frequently? I wrote to her expressing my sorrow for how things ended, but she gave me no response. Anything else to do? We met in college.\n\nGhosted: I’m sorry you’re going through this. I don’t know how frequently it happens but as someone who has been on both sides of this scenario, I do know it is often more complicated than it seems on the surface. And it can be extremely painful, no matter which role you play. Especially when you have made honest attempts to better understand where things went wrong so you could repair the damage.\n\nAs trite as it may sound, I encourage you to search for what this situation can teach you. There are always lessons in the pain, for both parties, if you look for them. Once, after a friendship breakup left me reeling, I was so heartbroken that I resorted to speaking with a psychic (don’t judge me!) who helped me see that I would grow exponentially more from this glorious friendship plus its devastating breakup than I would from the friendship on its own. Both were meant to be. And both taught my former friend and me some essential lessons that will stay with us. This helped me accept the good with the bad, let go of the urge to fix what was invariably broken and remember that even painful endings happen for you, not to you.\n\nNow, there’s no telling if this is actually the end for you and your old friend. Sometimes people just need time to process from a distance before they feel ready to face an issue. It can feel easier for some people to just disappear for a while rather than communicate directly when they are upset. Is it the most mature or loving way to handle conflict? No, of course not. But people are imperfect and, if we love them, we must accept them, flaws and all.\n\nSpeaking of, have you stepped back to really take stock of your own flaws and how they may have shown up in your friendship? What are the challenging parts of your personality that she may be pulling away from? Rather than putting the onus on her to provide examples that justify her hurt feelings, can you own that her expressing hurt feelings to you is enough of a reason to apologize and reflect on your role in this? In the absence of immediate or direct answers from your ex-friend, it is important that you go into deeper reflection on why she felt criticized by you. Are you self-critical or critical of others? Does that come through in your words or actions? Sit with yourself and these questions; journal about what comes up.\n\nAs you work on yourself, you must make peace with letting her go and loving her from afar — at least for now. While it is impossible not to take something like this personally, it is helpful to zoom out to contextualize this experience a bit. You said you’ve known each other since college. Have you ever noticed a pattern of avoidance come up in any other areas of her life? How has she handled conflict with other people? Is ghosting a trait that surprises you or are you just surprised she could ghost you — someone she said she loved like a sister? Was your connection strained in other ways before this breakup?\n\nAfter taking inventory of it all, does this friendship feel in alignment with where you are now and what your expectations of friendships are? Is this a friendship that you still genuinely want to invest in? Or are you more interested in getting closure? It is important that you get clear on these questions.\n\nFor now, give it time. You can’t control what happens next with this friendship. The only person you can control in this situation is yourself. Focus your energy on being more mindful of your words going forward to preserve other important relationships in your life. My husband says embedded in almost every interaction is an opportunity to build someone up or tear them down. You may not be aware of how your words impact people until it’s too late.",

  "text": "Matt Griffin, 54, who works in communications for a school district in Vancouver, Wash., said he thinks about his father, Grady Griffin, every day, and he remembers what he was doing the night his father died. But he can’t remember the exact date of his death from terminal brain and lung cancer. (He looked it up, and it was 19 years ago this month.) “I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect everybody to recall everything,” he said. “The thing I know that is ever present is my dad is gone, and I miss him.”\n\nMental acuity has been a flash point affecting both presidential candidates, but it has taken on new urgency following a special counsel report into Biden’s handling of classified documents. The report noted that Biden, 81, had trouble recalling the years he served as vice president and didn’t remember the exact date his son Beau had died, among other issues. Trump, 77, has struggled with his own memory lapses, most recently confusing former U. N. ambassador Nikki Haley, his last-remaining rival for the Republican presidential nomination, with former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n“Most of us have memory slips all the time,” said Earl K. Miller, professor of neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We can’t remember where we put our car keys. We can’t remember dates or names. But we don’t really notice the mistakes when we’re young. It’s when people get older that mistakes in memory seem to have more significance. Memory lapse really is normal at every stage of life.”\n\nThat’s why the stories we tell about our real memories may shift and change over time, and misremembering is common. Mitt Romney once shared a memory about a jubilee in Detroit that took place before he was born. Hillary Clinton once spoke of being under sniper fire in Bosnia, only to later admit that she had her facts wrong.\n\n“Memory is never perfect even when it seems perfect,” said Miller. “We remember what we want to remember. That’s true for everyone at every stage of life. If we literally remembered everything, it would be too much for our brains. Our brains would be completely overwhelmed. We always have selective memory.”\n\n“The possible consequences of retaining every detail of every experience might be a very cluttered mind and an inability to sort through relevant and irrelevant experiences,” Schacter said. “So the fact that we don’t encode and retain typically every detail of every experience leaves us prone to forgetting, but on balance is probably a good thing because we end up, by and large, remembering the most important things.”\n\nThe effects can be seen most clearly during speech, he said, an activity that takes place at relatively high speeds and requires considerable mental juggling and swift recall. “But word retrieval becomes more difficult with age, so people stumble while talking,” he said. “It’s not that they don’t know what a word means, but retrieving it takes more time.”",

  "text": "The violence in Israel and Gaza has reignited tensions on U. S. college campuses over a conflict that for decades has fueled student and faculty activism, and divided academic communities. The reaction at Vanderbilt is just one example of the tightrope some college leaders appear to be attempting: renouncing the violence and pleading for security and civility on their campuses, while often sidestepping the contentious politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAt Vanderbilt, it was unclear why the university took down the chancellor’s earlier statement about the war. When The Washington Post asked if it had been pulled because of criticism, Vanderbilt spokesperson Julia Jordan said that the “statement from the chancellor,” as it was labeled online, was actually not a “statement.”\n\nHigher education has long provided a staging ground for contentious debates related to Israel, whether it’s students pushing for universities to divest from the nation or protesters clashing with campus speakers on either side of the political divide. But the immediacy of the current conflict has created what some students described as a profound unease on campuses, however far they may be geographically from the front lines of the war.\n\nChanie Goldman, co-director of the Chabad Jewish Student & Community Center at UF, said that a loud sound during the vigil — apparently a steel water bottle hitting the ground — was misinterpreted by some as a gunshot. Students had arrived at the event fearing something might happen, she said, and it didn’t take much to cause alarm. “Jewish kids are very scared and very on edge,” Goldman said. “It’s a rough time now.”\n\nSome students said this week they hoped to set politics aside and focus on the profound loss of life. Jacob Bigelman, a junior at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said he was so distraught by the events in Israel, where he had studied during a gap year after high school, that he couldn’t focus in the library on Sunday morning. Instead, he channeled his energy into organizing a vigil. “Let’s just do something,” Bigelman recalls telling a friend.\n\n“There’s obviously going to be time to engage in talks about all that is going on and all that’s unfolding,” Bigelman said in an interview Monday. “But our message [at the vigil] was about unity and being just one strong Jewish community. I told one of our rabbis, I was so blind to how large and how strong the Jewish student body on campus is.”\n\nJohaer Jilani, a student director of the Muslim Students Association National, said he worried that any “geopolitical event” of this kind might trigger anti-Muslim sentiment. Jilani, a medical student at Howard University, said he condemns violence against civilians, whether perpetrated by Palestinians or Israelis. He expressed disappointment, however, that university leaders have not generally given voice to the Palestinian cause. This is particularly regrettable, Jilani said, given how Muslim students have rallied in support of other social justice and liberation causes, such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the Ukrainian resistance, which are widely embraced in higher education.\n\nDiverging views on the conflict are already creating divisions on campuses. Over the weekend, Students for Justice in Palestine at Rutgers University issued a statement standing with the “Palestinian resistance” and calling the attack on Israel a “justified retaliation.” The message was deeply offensive to Jewish students, said Lisa Harris Glass, chief executive of Rutgers Hillel, one of the nation’s largest chapters. In addition, she said stickers with QR codes leading to an Arabic language website were placed on bollards outside the organization’s building, which Glass interpreted as hostile. Hillel requested and received additional security in response, she said.",

  "text": "Donald Trump on Monday asked the Supreme Court to block a lower-court ruling that he can be criminally prosecuted for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, insisting that presidents are shielded from prosecution and that a trial would “radically disrupt” his reelection bid. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.If a president can be criminally charged for actions taken while in office, Trump’s lawyers warned, “such prosecutions will recur and become increasingly common, ushering in destructive cycles of recrimination.” They added: “Without immunity from criminal prosecution, the Presidency as we know it will cease to exist.”\n\nIt was the second time in less than a week that the leading Republican presidential candidate turned to the nation’s highest court to intervene in an unprecedented legal question that could shape his political future, in this case explicitly requesting that the Supreme Court keep his criminal trial on hold to allow his political campaign to move forward unimpeded. At oral argument in a separate case on Thursday, the justices seemed inclined to reverse a ruling from Colorado’s top court that Trump should be barred from the ballot because of his conduct around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol.\n\nMonday’s filing asks the justices to temporarily suspend — pending a formal appeal to the Supreme Court — the sweeping rejection by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit of Trump’s claim that he is shielded from prosecution for actions he took while in office.\n\nIt came on the same day that Trump attended a court hearing in Florida in a separate criminal case, in which he faces federal charges of mishandling classified documents and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them. In Georgia, a different hearing addressed allegations of misconduct against a state-level prosecutor who has charged Trump in connection with alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results there.\n\nForcing Trump into a months-long criminal trial, his lawyers said in their Monday filing to the Supreme Court, effectively sidelines him from campaigning, undermines the First Amendment rights of American voters “whether they support him or not, and threatens to tarnish the federal courts with the appearance of partisanship.”\n\nThe request gives the justices a potentially key role in determining whether and when Trump, who is closing in on the Republican nomination, will face a federal criminal trial in Washington. U. S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, had paused pretrial proceedings while the appeal was pending and postponed a scheduled March 4 trial date until the appeal is resolved.\n\nThe 57-page D. C. Circuit opinion delivered last week was a forceful and unanimous rebuke from an appeals court panel with two judges nominated by President Biden, a Democrat, and one nominated by Republican George H.W. Bush. “We cannot accept former President Trump’s claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power — the recognition and implementation of election results,” the judges wrote.\n\nThey said trial preparations could resume in the case in D. C. unless Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the proceedings by Feb. 12, giving the former president little choice but to go directly to the justices instead of seeking a review from the full appeals court.\n\nAs they decide whether to grant Trump’s request to keep the proceedings on hold, the justices are also likely to consider whether to schedule the immunity issue for argument before the Supreme Court’s term ends in late June or early July. The justices could deny Trump’s request and allow the D. C. Circuit’s ruling that Trump can be prosecuted to stand, clearing the way for trial proceedings to resume immediately.\n\n“Conducting a months-long criminal trial of President Trump at the height of election season will radically disrupt President Trump’s ability to campaign against President Biden—which appears to be the whole point of the Special Counsel’s persistent demands for expedition,” said the filing from his legal team, led by attorney D. John Sauer.\n\nTrump’s attorneys also objected to the appeals court’s order that he take the case to the Supreme Court in just four business days or risk having trial proceedings restart. They called the timeline an “unprecedented and unacceptable departure from ordinary appellate procedures.”\n\nSome legal experts say there is good reason to think at least four justices will vote to take up Trump’s immunity appeal; he is the first former president to be charged with a crime, and the justices may want to have the final word on such a significant issue as whether he is shielded from prosecution.\n\n“Everyone knows that’s been Trump’s goal,” Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, said during a panel discussion last week that focused on the former president’s legal troubles. “If he can drag this on until after the election, and if he wins, he will quickly kill this case.”\n\nEven though the immunity case and questions about Trump’s ballot eligibility are distinct, legal observers have suggested the justices may seek a compromise when it comes to resolving the matters involving the former president. After oral argument in the Colorado case, Richard Hasen, a UCLA law professor, said a “grand bargain” appears to be emerging.\n\n“For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,” the panel wrote. “But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as president no longer protects him against this prosecution.”",

  "text": "The Wexner Foundation, a philanthropic organization focused on cultivating Jewish leadership, is cutting ties with Harvard over what it described as the university’s inadequate response to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, which killed at least 1,400 people in Israel. Why are Israel and Hamas at war? A basic explainer.The split is the most recent development in an ongoing controversy at the Ivy League university resulting from a statement signed by a coalition of Harvard student groups in response to the attack, which said that the Israeli government was “entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” Critics have said that Harvard was too slow to respond to the letter and not forceful enough when it did.\n\nThe university has become a microcosm of tensions arising at U. S. higher education institutions, where donors have distanced themselves and protests have broken out on campuses — all over responses to the war.\n\nIn a Monday letter, the Wexner Foundation wrote that it is “stunned and sickened” by Harvard’s failure to “take a clear and unequivocal stand” against Hamas’s “barbaric murders” of civilians in Israel, particularly after the student letter.\n\nFor more than 30 years, The Wexner Foundation, founded by Leslie Wexner, a controversial billionaire retailer, has partnered with the university to fund fellowships for Israeli government and public service professionals to pursue a master’s degree at Harvard Kennedy School. The organization donated more than $2.4 million to Harvard in the 2021 fiscal year, the Boston Globe reported. In the letter this week addressed to the Harvard Board of Overseers, the foundation writes that the two “are no longer compatible partners” and they will seek other ways to develop Israel’s leadership.\n\nIn a statement, Harvard Kennedy School pointed to leaders’ recent public condemnations of Hamas and said they are “grateful to the Wexner Foundation for its very longstanding support of student scholarships.”\n\nThe Harvard students’ letter was considered incendiary as it did not mention Hamas and blamed the Oct. 7 killings on what they called Israel’s “apartheid regime.” For years, “millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison,” the groups write, invoking an analogy often used by human rights organizations to describe Israel’s blockade on the densely populated strip, which has limited Palestinian movement for more than 15 years. The groups pointed to targeted killings and family separations among other struggles, and called on Harvard to “take action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians.”\n\nBacklash to the letter came swiftly, including from fellow students, prompting some signatories to publicly retract their signatures. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a Harvard graduate, said it was “intellectually weak and morally repugnant,” writing in a statement that, “Terrorism is never justified nor someone else’s fault” and “you can stand up for Palestinian rights while condemning Hamas terrorists.”\n\nWhen Harvard did not immediately respond to the letter, the university’s former president Lawrence H. Summers wrote on social media that he was “disillusioned and alienated” and that the silence allowed the institution to “appear at best neutral toward acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel.”\n\nHarvard’s President Claudine Gay in a later statement condemned the “terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas,” and added that the student groups that signed the letter do not speak for the university. Harvard Divinity School released a statement on Oct. 11 calling for acknowledging “decades of oppression” faced by Palestinians when considering “the story about Hamas’ horrendous attack on Israeli civilians.”\n\nFor the Wexner Foundation and others, the administration’s actions were not forceful enough. A letter from Harvard faculty members said that the student groups’ letter “could have been a teaching moment” to remind students that “some acts such as war crimes are simply wrong.” The statement “fell short” and “failed to condemn the justifications for violence that come from our own campus,” the faculty members wrote.\n\nKenneth Griffin, a billionaire who pledged $300 million to Harvard earlier this year, urged Harvard to more forcefully defend Israel in a call to a senior Harvard leader, the New York Times reported. Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer and his wife Batia quit the Harvard executive board, saying in a statement to CNN that they “denounce those who seek to place blame on the people of Israel.”\n\nMeanwhile, students accused of signing the letter have faced threats and doxing (publishing a person’s private information on the internet). Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman wrote on social media last week that he had been asked by “a number of CEOs” if Harvard would release the names of members of organizations that issued the letter, so they could avoid hiring them. A billboard truck drove around campus with photos and names of the students said to have signed the letter, labeling them “antisemites.”\n\nThe human rights and literary organization PEN America condemned the “harassment of any students, regardless of their viewpoint” and called the campaign against the students “an undeniable threat to freedom of expression.”",

  "text": "Come Valentine’s Day, the world rhapsodizes about romance — what causes it, and what keeps it going. But the conversation often overlooks a key ingredient to a successful relationship: a sense of humor.\n\n“Humor between partners is both a lubricant that oils the gears of our relationships and a social glue that binds us,” says Steven Sultanoff, a psychology professor at Pepperdine University and former president of the Association for Applied and Therapeutic Humor. “It signals our ongoing interest in each other as well as compatibility, cooperation and commitment.”\n\n“Humor can help or hurt a romantic relationship,” says Jeffrey Hall, a communications studies professor at the University of Kansas. Hall has researched the effects of humor in relationships for more than 20 years, and his 2017 meta analysis on the subject is cited widely. “Humor’s value all depends on how it’s used,” he adds.\n\nA 2023 study in the journal Current Psychology reported that romantic partners rated humor the second-most-important predictor of relationship satisfaction, just after “valuing” and before “receptive listening.”Humor is a language Elvira and I speak fluently, ranging from the clownish to the cerebral. We call each other silly names, we make silly faces, gestures and sounds, and we crack wise.\n\nThen again, Elvira occasionally accuses me of kidding around too much — full disclosure: She’s right — only for me to reply, true to form, “Surely you’re joking.” Likewise, she often asks me to stop my self-deprecating humor, my go-to habit of putting myself down to get an easy laugh.\n\nEarly in our marriage, after I went too far with my wisecracks, Elvira mailed me a sympathy card. “Because you are so annoying,” she wrote inside, “my heart goes out to you.”\n\n“Malign humor toward oneself and others can foster toxicity in and between people,” says Andrea B. Horn, psychologist and psychotherapist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. “Irony, for example, can be very funny but also brutally mean. If humor leads to someone feeling devalued or misunderstood, it can negatively affect a relationship.”\n\nIndeed, a small study provocatively titled “Bad Humor, Bad Marriage” looked at 98 married and 48 divorced couples. It found that antisocial humor from men and self-defeating humor from women proved to be predictors of divorce. “Humor styles were unique predictors of divorce beyond the impact of insecure attachment,” researchers from Université Catholique de Louvain wrote.\n\nIt’s all well and good, naturally, for a husband or wife to be individually funny. But are they also funny together? Do the two senses of humor match up? According to some research, partners most value humor that is shared.\n\n“Individuals belonging to couples with higher shared laughter durations reported feeling closer to and more supported by their partners,” wrote the authors of “Putting Laughter in Context: Shared Laughter as Behavioral Indicator of Relationship Well-Being.” Humor in a couple, at its best, is reciprocated, a collaboration that balances competing priorities.\n\n“What is strongly related to relationship satisfaction is the humor that couples create together,” Hall says. “That’s the most important takeaway. It’s good to have humor yourself, but it’s better to see it in your partner, and it’s best of all to share it. You affirm your relationship through laughter.”\n\n“Relationships take work, so you should work on your humor together, especially if you feel out of sync with each other,” says Robert W. Levenson, a psychology professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who has studied positive emotion in relationships, including humor, for more than 25 years. “Talk about it — say what makes you feel good and what makes you feel bad. Give each other feedback so you can calibrate your humor accordingly.”\n\nIn our 48 years as a couple, humor has turned out to be among the most important tools in our marital survival kit, ranking right up there with respect, trust, loyalty, honesty and the spirit of compromise.\n\nCall our attitude a matter of philosophy. We kid around with each other because life  is much too serious for us to take too seriously.",

Two of her children have been taken hostage by Hamas. (Ofir Berman for The Washington Post) TEL AVIV — At 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 7, Hadas Kalderon received the last message from her son.“Mom, be quiet, don’t move,” Erez, 12, texted. Hamas militants had stormed his father’s house, in their southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Oz, where he and his 16-year-old sister, Sahar, had spent the night. Erez and his sister had jumped out the window and were hiding in the bushes. But he was thinking of his mother, just down the road, trying to protect her. Gunmen were rampaging through their tiny pastoral community, shooting entire families, some at point-blank range, as they clung to each other in beds and safe rooms.“I love you forever. I hope you survive,” she texted back. There was no reply.For hours, Hadas called Erez’s cellphone again and again, even as she fought for her life, physically blocking militants from breaking down her safe room door. She heard them screaming, “Allahu akbar” as they set fire to parts of her home.When Israeli forces finally arrived in the late afternoon, the Kalderon family emerged from hiding, and Hadas’s older daughter found an 18-second video circulating on social media. It showed Erez in a black T-shirt, being gripped by both arms and led into captivity. The militants referred to Erez and another group of children who do not appear in the shot as “child settlers.”Kalderon has replaced eating and sleeping with chain-smoking. Her voice is raw from overuse. She is in a “living hell,” she said, having told her children for years not to be afraid. Now, “the nightmare has come true.”Five members of the family were taken, including Erez, Sahar and their 50-year-old father, Ofer; their 80-year-old grandmother, Carmela, and a 12-year-old cousin, Noya, were grabbed from another house in the community. There are 203 people being held hostage in Gaza, according to the Israeli government, including civilians with passports from at least 31 other countries.Hadas’s childhood friend from Nir Oz, whose relatives are also being held in Gaza, has commandeered her cellphone, shielding her from the relentless, looping horrors on social media — the celebrations of the bloodshed, the parading of humiliated captives, some stripped down to their underwear, others huddled together in what could be Hamas’s vast network of tunnels. In one case, militants uploaded a video showing the killing of an elderly woman to her own Facebook page. Her granddaughter discovered it.The militants’ decision to film their reign of terror has deepened the anguish of Israelis, but it has also given experts in Israel’s vaunted cybersecurity and intelligence sectors a great deal of evidence to work with. They are leading a grass-roots effort now to comb through the footage and the photographs for clues about where hostages are being held.“The state has the tools and the information, but they don’t have the apparatus to work as quickly as we do,” said Ido Har-Tuv, a former member of Shin Bet, Israel’s secretive national security service, and the chief executive of Gitam BBDO — an advertising agency that has opened a makeshift “war room” out of its offices in a gleaming high-rise in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hahayal, Israel’s Silicon Valley.“We’re running our operation here like a lean, efficient start-up,” Har-Tuv said. “We don’t have time.”Many of the roughly 100 men and women in the “war room” have deep military and intelligence experience, and some are being called up by Israel’s most elite units. They include 8200, the Israeli military’s cyberintelligence division, and Duvdevan, its undercover counterterrorism unit, which was the basis for the Netflix series “Fauda.”Refael Franco, the former deputy head of the National Cyber Directorate, is overseeing the construction of the group’s platform, which is based on cutting-edge AI and facial recognition technology. It is a sophisticated system that cross-checks images posted by militants posted on social media against photos of the hostages provided by families. When a match occurs, the system can geolocate — within seconds — the approximate location of a missing person. Open-source intelligence experts then try to zero in further, relying on contextual clues like mosques, local shops or the angle of the sun.The teams have already built a database of an estimated 1,000 people, including hostages and hostage takers. They are getting personnel and logistical help from Google, which has offices across town. They have shared their platform with Israeli security officials, who will use it to further their own search.Hamas took at least 64 captives into Gaza, visual evidence suggestsBut it is a time-consuming and inexact process. One of the biggest challenges, Franco said, is that hostages have been moved repeatedly.“That being said, every time someone picks up their phone and uploads footage in the strip, we can cross-check it in the system to know where they are,” he said. They will keep following the digital clues, he said, for “as long as this mission takes.”Most of the videos were filmed and posted during or shortly after the initial abductions, flooding social media sites such as Telegram, Facebook, Snapchat and X, formerly known as Twitter — oftentimes all at once. Many were easy to find because they were posted with the same set of hashtags. In rare instances, Palestinian gunmen could be heard discussing where to take their captives.One set of videos, believed to be filmed by militants and passersby in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, showed a hostage being led by gunmen; on a wall in the background was a phone number of a local businessman, tipping off the team to the neighborhood.“We’re figuring all of this out as we go,” said one volunteer, among a group hunched over their laptops as they toggled through spreadsheets filled with translated posts, hashtags and geolocations.The man spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a reservist with Duvdevan. As time goes on, he said, the militants are posting less and, when they do, they are focusing more on themselves and their injuries.And as Israel expands its punishing air campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 3,700 people, hostage takers may lose electricity or cell reception and go dark entirely.Kalderon has not turned on the news since the attack. All she knows is that 80 of her 400 neighbors are dead or missing. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.She was unaware of the grass-roots efforts to locate the hostages, but she was not surprised. Across Israel, civilians have mobilized to provide aid to victims in the south and equipment to the troops, filling gaps left by the government.For a week and a half, Kalderon and her relatives heard nothing from Israeli officials about the status of their loved ones, or efforts to bring them home.On Wednesday, a military notification officer told Kalderon that her mother, Carmela — a peacenik immigrant from New York who for years helped Gazans receive medical treatment in Israel — and her autistic niece Noya — who was sleeping over at her grandmother’s — were both dead. There was no information about the others.Kalderon and other relatives of hostages say have they experienced a double trauma: first left to fend for themselves when militants overran their communities, now left to navigate a deafening silence from their government.“Every second, every second, that our children are there is one second too much, and yet all Netanyahu talks about is ‘winning the war,’” said Kalderon, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.He has met with only a handful of families — days after President Biden and members of his administration first reached out to them — and has provided few assurances.Kalderon, who also holds French citizenship, has met with French diplomats, including former prime minister Manuel Valls. But she is terrified that her own government, in preparing for a full-scale invasion of Gaza, may cast her children off as collateral damage.“We are simple people; we are good citizens,” she said. “We gave whatever we could to our country. It’s the Israeli government that just forgot us.”Israel-Gaza war: Israel’s military said it rescued two hostages from the southern Gazan city of Rafah while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza’s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing political pressure to reach a hostage release deal, after rejecting a cease-fire and vowing to continue war.Middle East conflict: Tensions in the region continue to rise. As Israeli troops aim to take control of the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, officials in Cairo warn it would undermine the 1979 peace treaty. Meanwhile, there’s a diplomatic scramble to avert full-scale war between Israel and Lebanon.U.S. involvement: U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria killed dozens of Iranian-linked militants, according to Iraqi officials. The strikes were the first round of retaliatory action by the Biden administration for an attack in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops.Middle East conflict live updates: CIA Director Burns in Egypt for hostage talks; Gazans look to flee RafahMiddle East conflict live updates: CIA Director Burns in Egypt for hostage talks; Gazans look to flee RafahBiden and Jordanian king warn about planned Israeli invasion of RafahBiden and Jordanian king warn about planned Israeli invasion of RafahPanic mounts in Rafah over looming Israeli offensive after night strikesPanic mounts in Rafah over looming Israeli offensive after night strikes",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

  "text": "Dear Sahaj: My husband and I are at a crossroad about having more children, but it’s complicated. We have been married almost a decade, have successful careers, and are parents to two amazing and beautiful children — a 2-year-old son and a nearly 1-year old daughter. Recently I brought up having more children. He blindsided me by saying he doesn’t know if he wants more. The reason I say “blindsided” is because I have always been open about my desire to try to have four children — two boys and two girls. It sounds very specific, because it is.\n\nYou see, in addition to the two children we have, we have two frozen embryos (one boy and one girl) waiting in a lab for us. Our children, and these remaining embryos, were created through IVF. We had a very painful and long journey to having children. After years of trying unsuccessfully, countless appointments and procedures (endured mostly by me) we were finally diagnosed with male factor infertility. Even though our diagnosis was male factor, I was the one to take countless shots, pills and supplements before, during and after egg retrieval and eventual pregnancy. And I did most of this alone.\n\nI will “age out” of being eligible to become pregnant via IVF before long. We don’t have the option to revisit this in a year or two. IVF is never a guarantee, but I want to try for these two babies. Two embryos created through literal blood, sweat and tears. I look at my children and can’t imagine not having one of them because they remain frozen indefinitely.\n\nWhat should I do? How can I talk to my husband about this? He refuses to have any conversation or even give me a timeline for when we can discuss. I fear I will resent him if we never have more children. To me, these frozen embryos are my babies.\n\nMother of Four: You say you fear you will resent your husband, but it sounds like you already do. Your question indicates that you carry a lot of unaddressed pain from your journey to have your first two children. This is an incredibly hard position to be in within your marriage, but there are several things you can consider.\n\nErica Djossa, a registered psychotherapist and founder and CEO of Momwell, a community focused on empowering and supporting moms, says your loneliness during this process only makes this impasse with your husband more challenging. “Your partner deciding he is done having children overlooks the mental and physical load you carried during this time and feels dismissive and invalidating,” Djossa says. You may need to address a deeper issue around fairness in your marriage.\n\nThere’s also a level of grief that you have yet to process. Grief over the journey of discovering and navigating his infertility. Grief due to your body’s biological limits. Grief regarding the unfairness of it all. “Coming to a decision often means having to confront loss and trauma,” Djossa says, “Having embryos feels like there is a door of possibility open, often delaying the processing and closure of being ‘done’ and with embryos that you have worked so hard for, deciding when to be ‘done’ is never easy.” It could be helpful to make space to explore your feelings outside of your marriage in support groups around infertility and motherhood, or by finding a therapist who specializes in working with these concerns and struggles.\n\nWith or without professional help, I encourage you to reflect deeper on how you really feel. Did you want four kids before going through IVF? Would you want two more kids if you didn’t have two other embryos created already? Or do you feel like, because you have invested so much time, “blood, sweat and tears,” you have to see this through? There’s no right answer, but you hold a specific version of your family and it’s holding you back from imagining something different. “There are many reasons why we may hold tightly to wanting to expand our family. Perhaps this is the idealized family we always imagined, or maybe we had a traumatic birth or experience and want a do-over. It could also be that we don’t have a sense of our family being ‘complete,’ but all of these reasons are rooted in our emotions,” Djossa says. Although it’s tempting, she says to try not to make big decisions when experiencing these big emotions.\n\nRight now, you and your husband are not connecting and may even feel like you are opposing each other. You need to find a way for you both to be on the same side, approaching the shared problem together — i.e., the question of whether to have more kids — rather than seeing each other as the problem. “It’s important to enter these conversations with the goal of actually listening to the other person’s perspective — to understand their experience as a parent, their hopes for the future, their fears, and why they feel differently than us,” Djossa says. Your husband sounds unsure of what he wants next; maybe he has fears and concerns about parenting, birth trauma, and his own unmet expectations of family and parenting.\n\nYou carried the heavier invisible load when it came to having your children, and it may feel like if you’re willing to try again, despite that, he should, too. You want to be heard, but that means also listening to your husband and being curious where he is coming from. Right now he shuts down, which raises the question of whether this is a communication issue you have experienced historically in your marriage, or if this is a coping skill he deploys because of a repeated communication dynamic that isn’t working. You wanting more kids is okay! You wanting more kids and not being open to hearing or talking about other feelings and options may be leading to a fracture in your relationship.\n\nYou can’t force your husband to get on board just because this is something you really want. You want to speak up for your own needs and desires while also not rejecting or invalidating your husband’s. It’s a delicate dance, but ultimately, you have to decide what is nonnegotiable for you and what that means for your relationship and life moving forward.",

  "text": "“Older teeth are more brittle, which makes them more prone to fracture and wear and tear,” says Olivia Sheridan, a professor of clinical preventive and restorative sciences at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine. Illnesses that are more common with age, like Type 2 diabetes, may also play a role.\n\nWhile dental problems can certainly cause pain, they can have other negative effects as well. Loose or missing teeth can make it more difficult to chew, especially foods such as produce with a hard consistency, says Athanasios Zavras, chair of the department of public health and community service at the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in Boston.\n\nDental issues may even harm your heart. A study in the Journal of Periodontology in 2021, for example, found that people with gum inflammation were more likely to have inflammation in their arteries, which raises vascular disease risk. “Gum disease creates gum pockets where anaerobic bacteria can thrive and travel to vulnerable sites in your body, such as your heart,” Zavras says.\n\nAll of this makes getting good dental care important as we age. But that can be challenging. Traditional Medicare doesn’t cover most dental services (though some Medicare Advantage plans offer some coverage). Here, experts weigh in on how to handle three common dental problems, including what you can do and what you need a dentist’s help with.\n\nReceding gums are often part of the problem. “When the gums recede, the tooth root is exposed, which can make it more prone to getting decay,” says Sally Cram, a dentist and spokesperson for the American Dental Association. And if fillings fracture over time, bacteria can collect in the cracks and lead to more tooth decay under the old fillings.\n\nThe best steps: To reduce the likelihood of cavities, brush and floss twice a day as recommended, and be especially diligent before bed, particularly if you snack at night. “Saliva [which helps protect teeth] naturally decreases as you sleep,” says Edmond Hewlett, a professor in the division of restorative dentistry at the UCLA School of Dentistry. “Anything you eat before bed — even just a cracker — will leave debris in your mouth that bacteria can feast on overnight.”\n\nIf you’re having pain, see your dentist as soon as possible. And if you’re especially cavity-prone, ask about prescription high-fluoride toothpaste for extra protection, Sheridan says. Your dentist may also recommend a custom tooth tray, which you fill with fluoride gel and place on your teeth for five minutes each night.\n\nGum (or periodontal) disease is an infection of the tissue that surrounds and supports your teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. It’s caused by plaque, the sticky film of bacteria that forms on your teeth. A less robust immune system hikes the risk of gum disease, Cram says, but difficulty brushing and flossing, dry mouth, and not keeping up with dental visits for cleanings can also have an effect.\n\nThe best steps: To prevent swollen, bleeding gums, make sure you’re vigilant about brushing. But remember to go easy: Too much pressure can lead to more gum recession. And floss as advised below. Older adults who floss regularly have a lower risk of gum disease, according to a 2020 study published in the Journal of Dental Research.\n\nWith age, your mouth produces less saliva, Cram says. This can lead to a condition known as dry mouth, which affects 30 percent of people over age 65 and 40 percent of those over 80, according to the ADA — and can raise the risk of cavities and gum disease. Certain medications can worsen the problem as well. Sometimes dry mouth is accompanied by a burning or tingling sensation (called burning mouth syndrome), which may be due to a vitamin B or iron deficiency, according to Cram.\n\nThe best steps: The first and easiest thing to do is to stay well hydrated, Hewlett says. “Keep a bottle of water with you all the time, and sip on it frequently to keep your mouth moist and wet and hydrated,” he says. Other drinks with no added sugar, like milk or herbal tea, are also fine, but alcohol and caffeine can dry out your mouth. If needed, the ADA recommends that you suck on ice chips.\n\nChewing on sugar-free gum or sucking on sugar-free candy that contains xylitol has been found to help ease the condition, Sheridan says. Talk to your doctor if you think your dry mouth may be related to medication, and see if you can switch to another drug. For burning mouth, you may want your primary care provider to check your iron and vitamin B levels, Cram says. If you’re deficient, they may recommend a supplement.\n\nBut which toothbrush is best? While a manual one can do a fine job, you might want to consider an electric toothbrush, Ballesteros says. A 2019 study in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology found that using one led to 22 percent less gum recession (a risk factor for gum disease) and 18 percent less tooth decay.\n\nSee your dentist regularly. There’s no hard-and-fast rule; it varies from person to person, but “at the very least it should be once a year,” Hewlett says. As you age and dental risk factors increase, it’s likely your dentist will advise a professional cleaning at least twice a year.",

  "text": "“The major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan to ensure the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there,” Biden said, referring to Israel’s publicly announced plans to invade the city. “Many people there have been displaced — displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north. And now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable. They need to be protected.”\n\nAbdullah was more direct. “We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to create another humanitarian catastrophe,” the king said. Referring to the war more broadly, he added: “We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end.\"\n\nThe joint comments by the president and the king Monday came after Biden met privately with Abdullah at the White House, the first face-to-face discussion the president has held with an Arab leader since the Israel-Gaza war began in October. The meeting came as U. S. officials have expressed deep concern about Israel’s plans to target the tiny town of Rafah, which borders Egypt and where about 1.3 million Palestinians are living in decrepit conditions after fleeing there under Israeli orders.\n\nDespite Biden’s growing willingness to publicly challenge Israel’s conduct of the war, he and his top aides have not publicly supported restricting aid to Israel or imposing conditions on it, as many of the president’s liberal critics demand. And while National Security Council spokesman John Kirby last week said an Israeli operation in Rafah “would be a disaster for those people, and we would not support it,” the White House has not threatened specific consequences if Israel proceeds with its plans.\n\nAn Israeli operation overnight Sunday in Rafah succeeded in rescuing two hostages, but it also killed at least 67 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, raising fears among Arab leaders that a sustained Israeli operation there could kill and injure thousands more. The planned Rafah operation has also escalated fears of a forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians, as Arab leaders fear they will be pushed into Egypt — a goal that far-right cabinet members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have openly embraced.\n\nAt a time when Biden has faced increasing criticism from Arab-American and Muslim voters angry over his staunch support for Israel and what they describe as a lack of empathy for Palestinians, Biden found a welcome ally in Abdullah. The president took the opportunity to highlight the suffering of the Palestinians, saying they are facing “unimaginable pain” and adding, “It’s heartbreaking. Every innocent life [lost] in Gaza is a tragedy, just as every innocent life lost in Israel is a tragedy as well.”\n\nJordan, whose population includes a large proportion of ethnic Palestinians, will almost certainly be key to any long-term American vision for the Middle East. Biden has said the war in Gaza must be followed by planning for a Palestinian state — a notion forcefully rejected by Netanyahu — and the United States believes that will require a thorough reform of the Palestinian Authority, which governs part of the West Bank. Jordan, which borders both Israel and the West Bank, would be central to any such effort.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has shown more willingness to take aim at the Israeli military operation in Gaza, last week calling it “over the top,” his strongest rebuke to date. But for months, Arab leaders in the United States and the Middle East have felt Biden’s public comments allowed little room for criticism of the hard-hitting military campaign.\n\nIsrael since then has mounted a fierce retaliatory campaign in Gaza, killing more than 28,000 Palestinians so far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. In addition, more than 80 percent of the territory’s residents have been displaced, and an Israeli siege has put hundreds of thousands of residents at risk of famine and disease.\n\nBiden and Abdullah have known each other for more than 20 years and have deep affection for each other, according to aides to both men. As vice president, Biden oversaw the Iraq portfolio for the Obama administration and made more than a dozen trips to the country. On each of those trips – either on the way over or the way back home – Biden stopped in Amman to visit Abdullah, Riedel said.\n\n“Abdullah can talk about all these issues in a level of candor that few other Arab leaders can because he knows Biden – they’ve been around together for a long time,” Riedel said. “I think he can be much more direct and candid. Part of the king’s objective here is to appeal to the empathetic part of Joe Biden and get him to show some empathy with the Palestinian people, which Biden needs to do for his own domestic political reasons.”\n\nThe conflagration in the Middle East, which has already spread to engage several Iran-backed militias in the region, carries the risk of significant political consequences for Biden. Arab Americans in Michigan and elsewhere are organizing to defeat him, and polls suggest that younger voters and people of color are deeply unhappy with his handling of the war.\n\nAbdullah’s trip to Washington is part of a tour to visit the United States, Canada, France and Germany, part of his effort to mobilize international support for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as well as the protection of civilians and for more humanitarian aid. Abdullah is also expected on Tuesday to meet senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as members of Congress.",

Here’s what it was like. This $3,499 headset is rough around the edges, but it made me optimistic about ‘spatial’ computingChris Velazco uses an Apple Vision Pro. (Carolyn Fong for The Washington Post) SAN FRANCISCO — I’ve fallen asleep watching movies on a Vision Pro, the $3,499 face computer Apple released earlier this month.I watched virtual planes land in Atlanta while listening to air traffic control, then edited a spreadsheet of addresses for wedding invites. I examined a roast through the headset’s cameras, and ate it without stabbing myself.Take it from me: Life inside this headset is equal parts mesmerizing and messy.When you get into the groove, using the Vision Pro can feel thrilling. But when things don’t work the way you expect — which in my case was pretty often — you may wonder why you didn’t just use the gadgets you already have.To see what “spatial computing” could really do for me, I wore the Vision Pro every day for two weeks. Here’s what you should know.Here's what you can and can't do Apple's new VisionProWhat it’s like to wear the headset for hoursComfort: I could wear the 1.3-pound Vision Pro for four or five hours before my neck needed a break, but I had to adjust the fit often. (And yes, taking it off is always a relief.) I never felt nauseous, and a colleague prone to motion sickness found the experience surprisingly bearable — but she still started feeling uneasy after 45 minutes.Navigation: When you open an app, it just floats wherever you stick it in the world around you, even if you walk away. Bring an app close to you, and you can interact with it the way you would on an iPad.But you’ll also have to get used to navigating with your eyes. For apps you’re not right next to, you can look right at them and put your thumb and index finger together to select something. I’ve watched total novices figure it out instantly — but there’s still a learning curve.Surrounding yourself with app windows can be helpful, but some may find it overwhelming. (Video: Chris Velazco/The Washington Post)Frequently, I’ve looked at some something I wanted to select and pinched my fingers, only for nothing to happen. I’ve “clicked” on the wrong thing because elements of an app or webpage were too close together. I’ve even flicked app windows someplace else completely, because I didn’t realize my fingers were touching before I moved my hand.“Spatial” computing: If the Vision Pro has one purpose, it’s to let you put the content and apps you want to use where you need them. You can have 9 or 10 apps running before the headset starts to struggle, and I’ve spent days trying apps in different places to see what feels useful. Surprisingly, those floating apps were most helpful when dealing with daily drudgery.I hand-wash dishes a lot, and it’s supremely tedious. But it’s less so when I have a YouTube video floating above my sink, one that I can interact with without drenching my phone or touching my ear buds.The Vision Pro's live video feed of the world around you is fast enough to cook with. (Video: Chris Velazco/The Washington Post)I also always forget about clothes in the dryer. Now, when, I do a load of laundry, I can hang a virtual timer in my hallway as a visual reminder.And on short afternoon workouts, I kept Slack and my email floating off to my side while (slowly) riding a stationary bike. By spinning a small dial (the “Digital Crown”), I could replace my apartment with a craggy Hawaiian landscape, complete with the sound of a lonely wind. I didn’t even need to reach for another device when someone needed me; I just pulled the app window over with a pinch and went to work.Silly? Maybe — but now that I’ve tried these things, I really want to keep doing them.In theory, the Vision Pro can be a portable, private office — just strap in, arrange your work apps, and get to it.I tried this for a few hours each day, and it’s definitely doable. It helps to pair a Bluetooth keyboard and one of Apple’s trackpads to the headset, since using the built-in virtual keyboard is a chore.But to get work done fast, I had to lean on the headset’s Virtual Desktop mode, which connects to a nearby Mac and turns its screen into a virtual window you can resize and stick where you like. When I’m editing my photos or tediously formatting all those wedding invite addresses, a big-screen version of my computer surrounded by vast, virtual environments is tough to beat.On Feb. 2, Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset went on sale. Help Desk reporter Chris Velazco tried the thing to see if it's worth the hype and the money. (Video: Monica Rodman/The Washington Post)But even this comes with quirks. If you have an Apple laptop,  you just have to look at it — a “Connect” button will appear over the computer. But if you use something like a Mac Mini, or a closed MacBook hooked up to a monitor, the Vision Pro may struggle to find it. (As I sat down to write this article, it took three tries to get the Virtual Desktop working.)The headset’s super-sharp screens also mean it’s wonderful for just watching things. I missed “Oppenheimer” in Imax earlier this year, but cuing it up on a virtual screen as big as my living room wasn’t a bad alternative. And the sound coming from a set of lump-like speakers was so good that I mostly left my ear buds behind.You’ll also want to keep the Vision Pro’s battery pack plugged in during longer movies; I generally got between two and three hours of use from a single charge.These are, arguably, what the Vision Pro is best at right now. The Vision Pro’s App Store could change that in time; for now it’s a funky a blend of the practical (like Microsoft’s Office apps), the gimmicky (like “Day,” which lets you spin VR turntables), and the odd-yet-earnest (like “Xaia,” an immersive AI therapy tool.)Apple’s new Vision Pro is a privacy mess waiting to happenPeople treat you a little differently when you’re wearing a Vision Pro.Sure, you can see them almost normally through the headset’s cameras. I say “almost” because you’ll see that video feed blur a little while moving your head. (Be careful walking over to them, too, since the headset blocks your peripheral vision.)But assuming you’re looking right at someone, they may be peering back at a set of hazy digital eyes on the headset’s outer screen. Those “eyes” are powered by the Vision Pro’s still-in-beta “Personas,” your virtual stand-for FaceTime video calls or Zoom meetings.My traveling fiancée was happy to cut our nightly FaceTime calls short after seeing it.I was nearly ready to write my Persona off until a friend with a Vision Pro FaceTimed me to catch up. The first half-hour of looking at his faux-face was unnerving. But as the conversation stretched into an hour, and then another, the weirdness had evaporated — it just felt like I was looking at my friend, not some weird facsimile. And he felt the same way.You can, and probably will, get used to these things. The real question is how fast, and who may avoid you until they get used to it, too.Unfortunately, the Vision Pro also has a sharing problem.A Guest User mode lets your friends see what the fuss is about, but two out of three people I’ve tried it with struggled to get through the setup process. (One person put the headset on four times before it even recognized it wasn’t looking at me.)And no support for multiple users means communal use at home isn’t possible the way it is with a Mac or iPad.Thankfully, there’s at least one way the Vision Pro can make you feel more connected to others: You can use it to view immersive  videos captured with an iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max, or another Vision Pro. (Don’t worry: You can watch them as normal 2D videos on an iPhone.) They don’t always feel lifelike, but when scenes were captured just right, I felt present — and a little less alone — in moments and with people who weren’t really there.You probably know you don’t need this right now. It’s bulky, expensive and very much a first-generation product. But it’s also a glimpse at a new way of living with technology; one I think a lot of people could find helpful if they get past some inherent weirdness.You might want to try it by scheduling a demo at an Apple Store. Better to lose 25 minutes than thousands of dollars.After these two weeks, I’m sold on what the Vision Pro can do. I want to keep app windows around me in just the right places, shut out the world sometimes when I need some alone time, and pop back in when I’m ready. I just don’t want to wear a hefty headset on my face to be able to do these things, or shell out at least $3,499 for it.Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

  "text": "Dear Carolyn: I’ve always been on the thin side, even getting screened for an eating disorder in high school — but I just had a high metabolism. My boyfriend of five years said I looked great, and emphasized it was better to be underweight than overweight. A while back, I got covid and ended up losing my sense of smell and even more weight. My boyfriend was very supportive, always telling me I was beautiful even when I felt like death.\n\nThis year, my sense of smell came back, and it’s been wonderful: Food tastes good again, and I’ve been treating myself. My doctor was pleased with my health and told me that I’d edged into the normal weight range for my height.\n\nWhen I got home, my boyfriend was happy to hear I’m doing well. Then he asked about my weight and seemed surprised when I told him. He said, “Wow, I’d never guess you weigh that much.” A few hours later, he brought it up again, asking whether I planned to get any heavier. I said no and that I’m fine where I am. He agreed but said about eight or 10 pounds less would be better. I asked him why, because the doctor was happy and all my labs are great. He said he thought it was normal for me to be on the thinner side and gave a definite weight he thought I should be. I repeated no, I’m running every day again, and I’m fine where I am.\n\nThe next day, he brought it up again, asking whether I was going to weigh myself once a week to keep track. When I straight-up asked him why he was so focused on this, he said he didn’t really care that much. I’m not convinced, because he’s still bringing it up. This morning, when I kissed him goodbye, he asked whether I’d weighed myself and tried to get me to check it with him right then. What do you think?\n\nI don’t see what there is to interpret. He tells you (daily!) exactly who he is and what he values. “Better to be underweight!” He’s as subtle as a wet T-shirt. But the effect of his bias on you was masked by your never having gained until now.\n\nSuggested script: “Hey, I’m glad you asked about my weight, again, for the fourth time in a week, as I feel the best I’ve felt in years. Here’s my plan: I plan to get heavier at times, and lighter at others, based on changing circumstances — because I am a normal person with a normal body. I plan to keep meticulous track of my weight, except when I don’t.\n\nRe: Weight: It doesn’t get better with people like this. They measure their self-worth by how attractive their partners are. I know because I dated one of these jackwagons. You are not a trophy. Put those running shoes back on and head for the door.\n\nAnonymous: I am posting this for its truth, efficiency and “jackwagons.” I flinched, though, at equating “thin” with “attractive.” Can we say “stereotypically ‘attractive’”? Or does that kill the vibe?\n\n· Break up with your boyfriend immediately. I hope a flood of people are writing to say this. That you don’t realize this is scary, controlling behavior is worrying to me.",

  "text": "It’s the second consecutive year Tesla critic Dan O’Dowd has run an ad campaign on television’s biggest night. He leads the Dawn Project, a group that has sought a ban on Tesla’s driver-assistance technology. The latest campaign is unequivocal: “Boycott Tesla,” it says, following footage of deadly and severe crashes involving its vehicles. One ad features footage of Teslas running over child-size mannequins, depictions that have previously led Tesla to issue a cease-and-desist letter.\n\nO’Dowd said he was compelled to bring awareness to the latest issue with what he calls “the most incompetent software I’ve ever seen” in part by The Post’s investigation. O’Dowd founded Green Hills Software, which makes operating systems for cars and airplanes.\n\n“What possible reason is there that they don’t disable Autopilot on roads that they say are not safe?” he asked of Tesla.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, did not respond to a request for comment. Musk’s followers have accused O’Dowd of a conflict of interest because one of Green Hills Software’s customers is Mobileye, which develops driver-assistance software. O’Dowd says his motivation stems purely from concerns over Tesla’s tech.\n\nTesla maintains that its software is intended to be used by a fully attentive driver and argues that it is “morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers,” citing figures it says show a lower prevalence of crashes when its software is activated.\n\n“The people would have it banned if they only knew the truth, if they only understood what it would do,” O’Dowd said. “Well, that’s our job. The politicians aren’t going to move until the public moves.”\n\nThe two ads highlight three significant crashes alleged to have involved Autopilot. In one, a 17-year-old was severely injured when a Tesla struck him at 45 mph as he disembarked a school bus in North Carolina that had its stop sign out and warning lights flashing. “Still Tesla does nothing,” the ad concludes. “Boycott Tesla to keep your kids safe.”\n\nThe ad makes reference to prior Dawn Project videos depicting the alleged failure of Teslas to react to child-size mannequins in the road — including last year’s Super Bowl commercial, which aired weeks before the North Carolina crash.\n\nThe other ad set to air during this year’s game shows the crash that killed a 50-year-old father in 2019 when his Tesla drove under a semi-truck trailer and the moment a Tesla blew through a stop sign and blinking lights on a rural Florida road as it barreled toward a parked vehicle and flung a young couple into the air, killing one of them and leaving the other severely injured — footage first published by The Post. In both cases, Autopilot was operating in locations where it was not intended to be used.\n\n“Tesla dances away from liability in Autopilot crashes by pointing to a note buried deep in the owner’s manual that says Autopilot is only safe on freeways,” the commercial opens, pointing to federal pleas to restrict it.\n\n“Shockingly, Tesla refused,” the commercial continues, leading into footage of the semi-truck crash and the crash involving the young couple. “This caused many tragic accidents when Autopilot was enabled on roads where Tesla knows it isn’t safe. Tesla must be held accountable. Boycott Tesla to keep your family safe.”\n\nThe company is facing concerns over stagnating revenue, mounting worries about its capacity to deliver long-promised “Full Self-Driving” technology, and Wall Street hand-wringing over the persistent distraction of its mercurial CEO. It has shed billions in value, down around 15 percent just in the past month.\n\nMusk has asked for a larger stake in the company as a condition for “growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics,” saying that without 25 percent control he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” But some investors have not given the idea a warm reception. In January, a Delaware judge ruled that an unprecedented $56 billion pay package awarded to him in 2018 was unfair.",

  "text": "The agency is also cautioning that the heft of the snow combined with strong winds could damage trees and knock out power. But the forecast for what areas will see the heaviest snow is proving to be difficult.\n\nBoston’s projected snowfall dropped from 7 to 13 inches to 4 to 8 inches. But in Philadelphia’s north and west suburbs, previously predicted to see just an inch or so, the forecast increased to 3 to 5 inches. In downtown Philadelphia, temperatures may be too mild for much more than an inch.\n\nFarther south, mostly rain is expected around Washington and Baltimore, but a possible brief period of snow is possible before the storm pulls away; the Weather Service said a slushy accumulation is possible in the north and west suburbs of the two cities.\n\nThe sweet spot for accumulating snow, previously expected from around Scranton, Pa., to Boston, has shifted to between Allentown, Pa., and Providence, R. I., where 5 to 10 inches could fall between Monday night and Tuesday. While heavy, these maximum totals are decreases from previous projections of at least 8 to 12 inches as model forecasts on Monday afternoon not only simulated a more southern storm track but also a somewhat less intense storm.\n\nThe storm follows an unusually mild weekend in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where temperatures reached the 50s and 60s. Snow cover is well below normal for this time of year across the contiguous United States due to a recent nationwide warm spell.\n\nRain should arrive from the south Monday night around midnight. As the precipitation becomes heavier and temperatures cool to the lower 30s, it should change to snow from north to south around 3 to 6 a.m., perhaps mixing with sleet during the transition. Snow could be moderate to heavy at times during the morning commute before leaving from west to east in the early afternoon. Long Island, especially eastern sections, could get a mix of snow, sleet and rain later into the morning.\n\nThe Weather Service is predicting around 4 to 8 inches in the city and Long Island, but amounts could be lower than that if temperatures don’t cool enough. The forecast increases to 6 to 9 inches in the Lower Hudson Valley.\n\nA mix of rain and snow should arrive early Tuesday around 4 to 7 a.m., then change to all snow around 7 to 9 a.m. as temperatures drop to near or below freezing, making deteriorating conditions during the morning commute. The snow should be moderate to heavy at times before moving out by early Tuesday evening.\n\nWinds could gust 30 mph to 45 mph Tuesday around Boston, and 40 mph to 55 mph on Cape Cod. Moderate coastal flooding is possible in eastern Massachusetts, where the Weather Service is predicting a surge as high as 3.5 feet at the time of Tuesday afternoon’s high tide.\n\nScattered rain showers should develop Monday by 6 p.m., becoming steadier during the evening and heavy at times overnight into Tuesday morning. The rain could mix with or change to snow around 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., perhaps mixing with sleet, before moving out from west to east by around noon.\n\nIt looks like temperatures will remain above freezing, which should limit snow potential in the city to around 1 inch. But amounts could quickly increase to several inches just north and west of the city, where winter weather advisories are in effect. Small shifts in the storm track could change the forecast to a snowier one.\n\nScattered rain showers could develop Monday afternoon around 2 to 5 p.m. The rain should become steadier during the evening and should be heavy at times overnight. It may mix with or change to snow around 6 to 9 a.m. Tuesday, especially north and northwest of the cities, before the precipitation leaves the area from west to east around 10 a.m. to noon.\n\nTemperatures should remain above freezing throughout the storm, with only a chance of a light snow accumulation, mainly north and northwest of Washington and Baltimore. Winter weather advisories are in effect for Baltimore as well as Washington’s far north and west suburbs.",

  "text": "Theoretically, solar thermal offers a big opportunity to slash emissions. Nearly 20 percent of an average home’s energy is used to heat water, and nearly 50 percent globally, according to MIT. By adopting solar water heaters, the average household can keep 2 tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, the equivalent of not driving your car for four months, estimates the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe basic principles haven’t changed much in the intervening century. Solar water heaters, perhaps the simplest way of turning the sun’s energy into heat, are made from little more than copper, aluminum and glass. Water in these solar collectors routinely reaches temperatures around 180 degrees Fahrenheit and can soar as high 400, before being mixed and stored in a standard water heater tank. A backup gas or electric heating element provides supplemental heat.\n\nOver the next few decades, the popularity of photovoltaics exploded as prices fell and the government poured millions into incentives for homeowners. But several factors doomed solar thermal’s national expansion: unskilled installers and shoddy designs, plunging natural gas and solar photovoltaic prices, and, crucially, the end of tax incentives in 1986 under the Reagan administration. By 1990, the industry had nearly collapsed.\n\nWherever the sun comes out, solar thermal collectors work well. Since they can cut fuel consumption to heat water by 50 percent to 70 percent, other countries are embracing the technology: Almost all new residential buildings in Israel must include solar thermal, while in countries as far north as Canada and Denmark, solar thermal energy warms millions of homes with district heating systems.\n\nMaybe, but it is likely going to require more than a dollars-and-cents calculation. The United States enjoys an abundant supply of cheap and reliable gas, unlike many places in Europe and Asia. But the cost of solar thermal could look like a bargain if we consider increasingly unreliable electric grids and the cost to the climate from burning fossil fuels.\n\nAnd for many homeowners, like my dad, the idea of getting nearly all their energy from the sun holds enormous appeal. He already wants solar power back on his roof. The home he bought about a decade ago came without it. So when he replaces the roof, he plans to add a couple of solar photovoltaic panels and batteries.\n\nChrisman at SunEarth has a rule of thumb: Solar water heaters can be effective anywhere below the 55th parallel (just north of the Canadian border) with high energy prices. But finding a skilled contractor can be difficult if you’re not in one of the handful of states with a history of solar thermal.\n\nAt the moment, he estimates, home solar water heating for single-family homes can theoretically pencil out in places along the West Coast and Northeast if energy prices are at least 20 cents per kilowatt hour or $1.50 per therm for natural gas, slightly above national averages. While the technology works elsewhere, the payback period — not counting emissions and its cost to the climate — may not materialize quickly or at all.",

  "text": "At some level, that’s not surprising — the past 12 months have been scorching, as a warm El Niño cycle combined with the signal of human-caused warming generated heat waves and extreme weather events around the globe.\n\n“This El Nino maximum is riding on top of a base climate that is continuously warming due to climate change,” Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, said in an email. “The combination of them is what’s giving us such hot global temperatures.”\n\nBut does this mean that the world’s most famous climate goal is out of reach? Not ... exactly.\n\nIn the 2016 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 nations agreed to keep the global average temperature from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels — and to “pursue efforts” to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The latter addition largely came from pressure from small-island states, who are at risk of disappearing under rising seas if temperatures get much higher.\n\nScientists have shown that holding the temperature rise to 1.5C could mean the survival of coral reefs, the preservation of Arctic sea ice and less deadly heat waves.\n\nMomentum has gathered around that more ambitious goal — even as carbon emissions continue to rise. Activists and environmentalists have chanted “1.5 to stay alive” and pointed out that emissions will have to be cut dramatically by 2030 to meet that target.\n\nNo. There’s actually some disagreement about what exactly counts as breaching that threshold — but scientists and policymakers agree that it has to be a multiyear average, not a single 12-month period. Scientists estimate that without dramatic emissions reductions, that will happen sometime in the 2030s. But there could be other single years or 12-month periods that cross the line before then.\n\nScientists and economists use complicated models to try to predict how fast the world can transition away from fossil fuels. The Washington Post analyzed 1,200 modeled pathways for the world to shift to clean energy and found that only four of them showed the world hitting the 1.5C target without substantially overshooting or using speculative technology (like large-scale carbon capture) that doesn’t yet exist. At this point, many experts believe that the economy is too stuck on fossil fuels to transition fast enough for 1.5 degrees.\n\nThat’s a more difficult question. Scientists don’t know exactly when certain tipping points — like the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet or the release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost — will occur. It’s very hard to predict and model these types of catastrophic changes.\n\nAnd 1.5C isn’t a magic threshold; it’s not as though as soon as we pass that number, Antarctic ice sheets will collapse and ocean circulations will grind to a halt. But one thing is certain: For every tenth of a degree of warming, tipping points are more likely. Two degrees is worse than 1.9 degrees, which is worse than 1.8 degrees, and so on.\n\nAnd at each tenth of a degree, the infrastructure and systems that the world has built — electric grids, homes, livelihoods — will become more strained. Our modern world simply was not designed for temperatures this high. At some level, the final temperature of the planet isn’t what matters most. It’s where countries can actually get carbon emissions to zero — and stop contributing to future warming altogether.",

  "text": "Dear Miss Manners: A major snowstorm was due to arrive. My friend called me and offered for me to come over to her house if I had a power failure, saying she had an extra bedroom and a generator, so her home would be warm. I thanked her. The next day, she called to remind me of her generous offer, and added that I should bring my little dog with me, too. She said, “I really mean it — please do not sit in a cold home.” I thanked her profusely for the offer.\n\nWell, the next day the blizzard started, the phone rang, and it was her husband, who never has called me. He said hello, and then: “I know you were invited, but do not drive in a blizzard” (which I wouldn't, anyway). He continued, “If your power goes off, just cuddle with your dog until it comes back on. Don't leave the house to come here.”\n\nI felt terrible. He called back in a second and said, “It’s not that we don’t want you here; we just want you safe.”\n\nYour friend doesn’t need a generator. Her house must be warm enough just from exchanges with her husband. Such as, “You said what? You call her right back and tell her she is welcome to come here!”\n\nWhether or not this exchange was preceded by the husband's saying, “It would be crazy for her to drive in this blizzard — it's too dangerous,” Miss Manners cannot say. She would prefer to think so, and advises you to do the same. You could probably find out if you complimented your friend on the thoughtfulness of her husband, but that seems like a risky idea.\n\nGeneral etiquette demands that I am thanked at the end of games for refereeing. How do I properly respond to the thanks? After all, I am getting paid to be there and enjoy my job, so I don’t think a “You’re welcome” is appropriate. How do you advise I respond to expressions of gratitude for just doing my job?\n\nWe thank lots of people for doing their jobs, and rightly so. But if you do not like the conventional “You are welcome,” Miss Manners suggests, “I appreciate your saying that.”\n\nShe has heard of a lot less gracious treatment of referees by those who are dissatisfied with the outcome of the game.\n\nWho cares if someone is married or not? I don’t want to give an extra thought to whether they’re married or single when I’m writing or speaking their name. Why can’t we pivot to a universal title like men have? No one cares if they are married/single/widowed, etc.\n\nGuess what? Miss/Mrs./Ms. Manners (who keeps 'em guessing) is happy to tell you that we do have a female courtesy title that is unrelated to marital status: Ms. Do not believe anyone who deprecates it as a 20th-century invention. It dates back at least to the 17th century, when it did just what you are requesting. Why do people keep resisting it?",

  "text": "Temperatures some 30 degrees above average broke numerous records and helped fuel the unusual episode. Scientists say such severe thunderstorm activity will probably become more common in the winter months as temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change.\n\nIn addition to the twister in Wisconsin, tornadoes were also reported in Marshall County and Putnam County in Illinois, where a semitruck was overturned. In Chicago, thunderstorms sparked a dramatic display of lightning.\n\nMore severe weather, inducing the possibility of a few tornadoes, is expected over portions of the Deep South this weekend and the Southeast by early next week.\n\nThe tornado appears to have been on the ground for a formidable distance in southern Wisconsin — perhaps 15 to 20 miles — on a southwest to northeast path about 20 to 30 miles south of Madison, the state capital.\n\n“We do have reports of damage in Albany, northeast toward Evansville and all the way northeast of Edgerton,” Taylor Patterson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Milwaukee, said in an interview. “Reports were a lot of tree damage, snapped power poles. There was damage to multiple outbuildings, and then we heard of a lot of homes that were missing their roofs.”\n\nThe setup for the tornado began with an area of low pressure system over Minnesota on Thursday. That low inhaled air from all sides. From the south, it drew a filament of mild air northward with a hint of moisture. From the north, a surge of cold, dry and dense air crashed southeast. The air masses met along a cold front.\n\nTornadoes usually happen when dew points, a measure of humidity, are in the 60s and 70s but can occasionally occur at somewhat lower levels. On Thursday, they managed to sneak into the 50s during the evening hours as a small pulse of moisture arrived from the south along a warm front. A dew point of 54 degrees was logged at the Monroe Municipal Airport shortly before the tornado touched down.\n\nTornadoes and rotating supercell thunderstorms require two things: storm fuel (referred to by meteorologists as convective available potential energy or CAPE) and wind shear. Wind shear is a change of wind speed and/or direction with height that promotes spin in the atmosphere. There was exceptional wind shear, but the amount of fuel available to the storms from moisture and warm air was marginal at best.\n\nThat said, the amount of moisture and warm air was considerably greater than typical for the time of year — and this seems to becoming increasingly common in winter storm environments because of climate change.\n\nNumerous warm weather records were set across the Upper Midwest on Thursday, including in Wisconsin, where some records were exceeded by as much as 10 degrees. Eau Claire hit 59 degrees, surpassing a previous daily record of 49 degrees. Its average high on Feb. 8 is 26 degrees.\n\nIn Monroe, near where the tornado touched down, the average high this time of year is 28.9 degrees, but the airport hit 58 degrees.\n\nAs climate change continues to influence the weather, the extent to which unseasonably mild and/or humid air masses can waft north in the wintertime is growing markedly. That is allowing thunderstorms and tornadoes to spread into what once were the typically quieter months.",

  "text": "But now, Intuitive Machines, a company based in Houston, is planning to launch its spacecraft to the moon early on Wednesday, setting up a possible landing later this month. If successful, it will be the first landing for the United States since the last of the Apollo missions in 1972 and the first commercial spacecraft ever to touch down on the lunar surface. The company’s phone-booth-size lander, Odysseus, is aiming for near the moon’s south pole, a region that is of particular interest to NASA because of the existence of water in the form of ice in its permanently shadowed craters.\n\nAlthough the spacecraft is owned and operated by Intuitive Machines, NASA has several science experiments on board and is paying the company $118 million to deliver them to the surface. The flight is part of a $2.6 billion space agency program designed to send a fleet of robotic spacecraft, operated not by NASA but private industry, to the moon over the next several years to bolster the space agency’s attempt to land astronauts there.\n\nThe effort demonstrates the growing role the commercial space industry has assumed in space exploration. NASA now relies on contractors not just to fly cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station, but also to develop the spacecraft that will land astronauts on the moon and the spacesuits they will wear while there. It is also looking to the corporate sector to build the habitats that could eventually replace the space station in Earth orbit.\n\nA successful lunar landing by a commercial vehicle would mark a significant milestone in the exploration of space by private enterprise, which NASA hopes will eventually help open up new economic and scientific activity on and around the moon. “By advancing our capabilities to operate on the lunar surface, the mission sets the stage for more ambitious endeavors, including the establishment of lunar bases and the exploration of potential resources,” Intuitive Machines said in a statement.\n\nAll of that remains years away, and landing on the moon is extremely difficult. In the first of the uncrewed flights to the lunar surface, a spacecraft developed by Astrobotic, a company based in Pittsburgh, suffered a problem with its propulsion system last month and sprang a leak, preventing it from reaching the lunar surface. Shortly afterward, a spacecraft operated by the Japanese space agency landed softly, making Japan the fifth country to land on the moon’s surface. But the spacecraft ended up on its side.\n\nNASA’s moon program has had some recent setbacks, as well. The space agency had been hoping that a quartet of astronauts would fly around the moon in its Orion spacecraft later this year, a mission, known as Artemis II, that would be somewhat similar to the Apollo 8 flight in 1968. But last month, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the flight will be delayed to September 2025 because the space agency needs to further study Orion’s heat shield, which showed more charring than anticipated.\n\nArtemis III, the flight that will transport astronauts to the surface, was also pushed back from 2025 to no earlier than September 2026. This time, the issue is delays in SpaceX’s development of its Starship spacecraft, which is supposed to ferry the crew to and from the lunar surface. Nelson said there are also delays with developing the spacesuits the astronauts will wear on the moon. That effort is being led by Axiom Space, another private space company.\n\n“The vehicle is ready,” Stephen Altemus, CEO of Intuitive Machines, said in an interview in October. “It’s performing wonderfully. … We know the odds of what we’re up against. We’ve done extensive testing beyond development testing, to make sure that the vehicle is performing as designed. And we’re confident coming out of our reviews that we’ve hammered all those issues flat and that we know how the vehicle behaves.”\n\nOdysseus will be carried to space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and will then speed toward the moon while undergoing complicated steps along the way. Once the spacecraft separates from the rocket, it will use special cameras to take images of stars that will allow it to autonomously orient itself in the correct position so that its solar arrays point toward the sun. Once powered up, it will turn on its communication radios to make contact with controllers on the ground.\n\nOn the way to the moon, the spacecraft will use its propulsion system to make course corrections to keep it on the right path, “like a car driver making minor adjustments with the steering wheel along a straight stretch of road,” the company said. It will aim for a spot near the moon that will allow it to enter lunar orbit, similar to how basketball players aim for the square on the backboard of the hoop. “If a basketball player hits the backboard square with a shot, the ball is likelier to go in the hoop,” it said.\n\nAs it approaches the moon, the spacecraft will fire its engine again, this time to put it into an orbit about 62 miles above the lunar surface. The plan calls for it to orbit the moon approximately 12 times while waiting for the lighting conditions to be right on the lunar surface. Each pass also will present a challenge for the spacecraft, as it alternates between the heat of the sun and the cold of darkness that will require “heat drawn from batteries to keep systems warm.” The spacecraft will lose communications with the ground for about 45 minutes on each orbit when the moon blocks Odysseus’s radio signal.\n\nAs the vehicle begins its descent toward the surface, it will fire its engine to drop from 62 miles to just over six miles. Then its cameras and lasers will feed data to the onboard navigation computers that will autonomously guide it to a safe place on the surface. At about 100 feet, it will flip itself to a vertical position with its landing legs pointed down. During the descent, the engine thrust will continuously decrease as the lander burns fuel and, as a result, gets lighter and lighter.\n\nBecause lunar dust will kick up as the vehicle approaches the surface, it won’t use cameras or sensors for the final touchdown, relying instead on what the company calls “inertial measurement,” which the company said senses acceleration and rotation like a human’s inner ear. “Terminal descent is like walking toward a door and closing your eyes the last three feet,” the company said. “You know you’re close enough, but your inner ear must lead you through the door.”",

  "text": "Dear Amy: My husband has been irritable, tense, short-tempered and basically taking things out on me and our 16-year-old son. I confided in my 39-year-old stepson (my husband’s son) and let him know that I was worried about his father regarding stress and potentially some depression issues. I did mention that we were not getting along well and suggested that perhaps the son could give his father a break and take him away from the stress of the family business. The getaway ended up being a trip to Vegas which included drinking, gambling and yes, strip joints. This of course put a bigger wedge in our marriage.\n\nWould it be appropriate to let my stepson know how hurt I am, since he coordinated the “bachelor trip,” or did I learn a painful lesson?\n\nBamboozled: Your intentions were good, but the essential error you made was to share your marital problems with your husband’s son. Confiding your concerns about his stress and possible depression is one thing, but entrusting children (no matter how old) with deeply personal relationship issues between parents is tricky. This knowledge can divide their loyalties, or — in your case — inspire a son to align with and enable his father. So, were you bamboozled when the son chose to take his dad for a Vegas blowout, versus a de-stressing yoga retreat in the woods? It was unrealistic of you to expect a different outcome.\n\nYour husband is unhappy. He is not treating you and your son well. His problem has come home to roost, and you and he should pursue marriage counseling right away. Couples’ counseling does not always repair relationships, but it does facilitate communication and create pathways for behaving differently. And sometimes, counseling sessions can uncover intractable issues which lead to couples deciding to part.\n\nMy instinct is that your husband might be toying with leaving the marriage; he is forcing the issue by treating you badly, which is a cowardly — but common — way to transfer unhappiness onto family members.\n\nDear Amy: I am a stay-at-home mom to a 9-year-old daughter. She’s, well, she’s great. She is mainly well-behaved and as an only child I try hard to give her lots of experiences with other kids. We have a cool “attic” room in our house that has low-sloping ceilings. We’ve set it up as something of a play space and we also store suitcases and extra bedding there.\n\nLast week, we invited “Sophie” to come on a Saturday for a playdate. I set up the play room with some craft supplies and snacks. The two girls were there for most of the afternoon and seemed to have a great time. After taking Sophie home I went into the room and it was a shambles. The suitcases were opened, bedding and food were strewn everywhere. I was completely shocked. This is absolutely not the way our daughter would ever treat our home.\n\nNow I don’t know whether I should call Sophie’s mother to let her know how destructive her daughter was, or whether I would ever welcome this child into our home again. Your advice?\n\nFrustrated: Never, ever, leave two 9-year-olds alone for several hours in a room full of temptations, because they will imagine and conspire and create their own world full of strewn bedding, snacks, and overall mayhem. One child does not play this way. Two children do. They trade ideas, come up with storylines about being orphans on a camping trip, and things have a way of going sideways.\n\nMy first piece of advice is to leave the snacks out of the playroom. This way, every now and then you will pop your head in and invite them into the kitchen to take a break from their play. This will allow you to see what they're up to and either marvel at their creations or course-correct them.\n\n“Sophie” might have inspired this destruction, but this could very well have originated with your child, who decided to push her well-behaved boundaries (perhaps showing off). Your daughter should do the cleanup, which is part of the responsibility of hosting.\n\nDear Amy: “Stressed” was a divorced mom who didn’t like it that her ex-husband showed up for games and school events on “her” custody days. I appreciated your response and would only add one reminder: The children didn’t get divorced, the parents did.",

  "text": "Artificial intelligence tools have made it easier than ever to generate images almost instantly. And AI tools peddling professional headshots for a fee are helping job seekers and workers quickly update their close-ups to appear as the best versions of themselves — or even better versions in some cases. But despite the ease of the process, the technology still has some kinks that could affect people’s body types, facial features or even alter ethnicities. And while using an AI-generated photo of yourself may impress and intrigue some, others could associate it with lying or being superficial.\n\nThe Help Desk tested three AI headshot web applications — Aragon.ai, Secta Labs, and Try It On. Though the three providers had different requirements, settings and styles of photos, they all had a couple of things in common: Each offered at least one photo that closely resembled the person and were professionally appropriate, and each provided results that had issues ranging from comical to borderline offensive.\n\nAragon.ai only requires six photos of yourself, while Try It On asks for at least 10, and Secta Labs needs a minimum of 15 photos. The services have a set of questions or options for users to help its systems better understand the images. Aragon.ai asks questions such as gender, age range and ethnicity, while Secta Labs allows you to include comments about preferred results including specific facial expressions, backgrounds or clothing. Try It On allows you to pick specific styles of photos you want to see, like whether you want them to be glamour shots or more professional.\n\nOnce the photos and options are selected and approved by the system, AI takes over. The tech uses artificial intelligence, some which was originally built on Stable Diffusion but are now proprietary models, to intake everything it knows about different types of people, options you chose and your uploaded photos. The result is an image that is ultimately a conglomeration of all three.\n\nWhile altering an image isn’t new, the scale at which people can make changes and create images — and the speed and ease in which they can do it — is what has made AI photo generators so transformative. Some providers say their technology is just the next advancement in photography following digital cameras, editing applications like Adobe Photoshop and filters on social media, smartphones and photo apps.\n\nIn our test, all three providers seemed to have trouble gauging a person’s body type since the uploaded photos are only from the shoulders up. So the results included depictions of the person that were thinner, heavier or taller than they really are.\n\nIt also took liberties with the chest, and for women specifically, how much they want to accentuate it. So clothing options ranged from high buttoned-up shirts, to tops showcasing cleavage to low-cut blazers worn bare-chested. One reason women may see more scantily clad results is because more sexualized images of women exist on the internet, which could be reflected in the AI’s training data. But it also may be offered intentionally.\n\nFirst, ask yourself what you are trying to convey and consider what your industry cares about, said Olivier Toubia, marketing professor at Columbia Business School. For example, for actors, headshots are really important, but it may not matter at a call center.\n\nAI headshot customers are using their photos for their LinkedIn profiles, company websites, internal email or chat apps, and even dating profiles and passport photos, providers said. The State Department, however, says it doesn’t allow digital alterations on passport photos, though it is unclear if it can identify AI-generated ones. Having an AI profile photo is not a violation of LinkedIn’s policy as long as it reflects someone’s likeness. But it has systems aimed at detecting and removing accounts that use AI photos for fake profiles.",

It’s an anthem of sorts for the weather community, and perhaps the first time that weather nerds were portrayed as “cool” or adventurous in a major motion picture.\n\nNow, nearly three decades later, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures are gearing up to release “Twisters” on July 19. The movie’s debut trailer aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday, and meteorologists are having a hard time containing their excitement.\n\n“The trailer looks amazing!” wrote Reed Timmer, extreme meteorologist and star of Discovery’s former series “Storm Chasers.” “It looks like a realistic depiction of up-close tornado chasing and extreme field science. The tornadoes look realistic and I love the focus on legendary tornadoes.” Timmer mentioned an apparent reference to the violent twin twisters that struck Pilger, Neb., in 2014.\n\n“Twisters” is a stand-alone sequel to the original, meaning it will build upon the backstory but has a self-contained plot, according to Vogue Magazine. It stars Daisy Edgar Jones and Glen Powell.\n\nThere’s no official word on whether Helen Hunt, who starred in the original alongside the late Bill Paxton, will make an appearance. That said, she was noticeably absent from the trailer.\n\nThe trailer chases groups jockeying for position as they track down tornadoes on the Great Plains. There are one or more brushes with death as chasers venture too close to the tornadoes. Some scenes were filmed in Oklahoma, including Chickasha, El Reno, Okarche and Cashion, last spring and summer with a budget of about $200 million, the Oklahoman reports.\n\n“I’m naturally interested and excited to see how it all comes together,” he wrote in an email. Smith has been keeping a watchful eye over Oklahomans since 2002, and has led warning issuance for hundreds of severe weather events in the heart of Tornado Alley.\n\n“A movie about tornadoes: so of course as a meteorologist, I am going to watch it. That’s not even a question,” he said in a message.\n\nSome on social media wondered if “Twisters” would encourage even more people to flock to the increasingly popular sport of storm chasing, which in recent years has caused chaser traffic jams and contributed to accidents and casualties.\n\n“My first impression was it looks like too much CGI,” she wrote on X. “There’s a lot of real footage out there, doesn’t need to be faked. I’m sure I’ll watch, but I don’t have high hopes.”\n\nMany who saw the trailer couldn’t overlook its depiction of the main characters sheltering beneath an overpass. That’s a massive safety risk during severe weather, since the winds are actually funneled and made faster under a bridge span.\n\n“There are some strong reactions to the trailer within the weather community, particularly with a scene which appears to show characters sheltering under an overpass,” Smith said. “Trailers showing a bunch of brief action shots don’t always give us the full context to understand what’s actually happening in a scene, and I think we just need to wait and see what it looks like in the final edit in July before getting too upset.”\n\nLarmeu, on the other hand, was unhappy with that scene even making it into the trailer. “I don’t think that things like that should be shown in a major motion picture, let alone a trailer that’s aired during the largest television event in America,” he wrote.\n\nOther meteorologists felt that the movie should simply be enjoyed for its entertainment value. Violeta Yas, a meteorologist at NBC New York, encouraged colleagues to “enjoy the commercial for like one hour before people start tearing apart the most trivial of technicalities.”",

  "text": "These and other incidents have rattled Jewish communities on campuses across America as they mourn victims of the Oct. 7 massacres and kidnappings. For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state. But the outbreak of war has elevated those tensions even further in recent days and raised new alarms about intimidation and antisemitism on campus.\n\nColleges and universities usually take pride in hosting demonstrations and debate, as long as no one gets hurt. Fiery rhetoric is tolerated and often encouraged as students and faculty members engage on politics, the climate, the economy, racism and war. But Jewish leaders say that too often debates over the Middle East take a problematic turn, leading to a threatening atmosphere for Jewish students. For them, that phenomenon is not new.\n\n“The campus climate for Jewish students has been degrading over several years, and that has been aggravated by broader increases in antisemitism and virulent demonization of Israel on campuses,” Adam Lehman, president and chief executive of the Jewish organization Hillel International, said in an interview. Lehman said the climate in recent days has worsened.\n\nAfter the surprise Hamas attack that left more than 1,400 people dead in Israel and thousands more wounded, the Georgia Tech chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi hung a banner from a balcony that declared solidarity with Israel. On Saturday, its members found the pro-Palestinian message written in shaving cream underneath the banner. The message was washed off, but it left a deeper impression: Their home, the fraternity members felt, had been violated.\n\n“We are deeply saddened by the defacing of our property that was committed last weekend,” the chapter said in a statement. “As a Jewish fraternity, we have all been deeply affected by the current events in Israel, and we are profoundly disheartened to see that this conflict has allowed antisemitism to gain a foothold on our campus. With our fellow Jews under attack in Israel, we feel that it is important to visibly display our support for the Israeli people as Jewish leaders at Georgia Tech.”\n\nAt Stanford, the Jewish news organization the Forward reported last week, an instructor had asked Jewish and Israeli students in a class to identify themselves, take their belongings and stand in a corner. The apparent point of the exercise, according to the article, was to show students how the instructor believed Israel treats the Palestinians.\n\nUniversity leaders acknowledged in an Oct. 11 statement that they had received a report of a class in which an instructor “addressed the Middle East conflict in a manner that called out individual students in class based on their backgrounds and identities.” Stanford President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez said the instructor, who was not identified, “is not currently teaching” while the university in California investigates. “Without prejudging the matter, this report is a cause for serious concern,” they wrote.\n\nAt Tufts University in Massachusetts, Micah Gritz, 21, a senior from Rockville, Md., who is a leader in a group called Jewish on Campus, said he was horrified to read an email in which a campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine used paraglider emojis to advertise a rally in nearby Cambridge. The email also praised “liberation fighters” — an allusion to Hamas militants — who had used paragliders in the cross-border attack and showed “creativity necessary to take back stolen land.”\n\nCornell was roiled after an associate professor of history, Russell Rickford, spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in Ithaca, N. Y. The Cornell Daily Sun, a student newspaper, and others published video of his remarks. In the speech, Rickford cited “many Gazans of goodwill, many Palestinians of conscience, who abhor violence — as do you, as do I.” But he also said many who support the Palestinian cause had strong feelings after learning of the Oct. 7 attack.\n\n“It was exhilarating,” he said. “It was energizing. And if they weren’t exhilarated by this challenge to the monopoly of violence, by this shifting of the balance of power, then they would not be human. I was exhilarated.”\n\nBut he told the Cornell Daily Sun that he believed the Hamas attack signaled that “the Palestinian will to resist had not been broken.” He acknowledged that in subsequent days, “we learned of some of the horrifying realities.”\n\nMartha E. Pollack, Cornell’s president, and Kraig H. Kayser, chairman of the university’s board of trustees, rebuked Rickford in a statement Tuesday and said the university was reviewing the matter. Faculty members at universities, especially those with tenure protections, are often given significant leeway in matters of free speech and academic freedom.",

  "text": "A sprawling winter storm known as a nor’easter is expected to bring significant weather and travel impacts to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Monday and into Tuesday, after first dumping heavy rain and causing possible severe thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast and in the Southeast on Sunday and Monday. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.The storm is likely to produce plowable snow across interior and mountain regions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Closer to the coast, along the Interstate 95 corridor, a mix of rain and snow is probable from New York City to Boston.\n\nConfidence remains low regarding how much snow will accumulate near I-95 because of uncertainty about the exact storm track and how cold it will get. Total precipitation — rain plus melted snow — across much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast looks to be in the range of about 0.75 to 1.25 inches.\n\nThe sweet spot for accumulating snow may stretch from central Pennsylvania into Massachusetts, where 6 to 12 inches could fall between Monday night and Tuesday. Population centers that could be affected include State College and Scranton in Pennsylvania; Poughkeepsie, N. Y.; Hartford; Providence; and Springfield and Worcester in Massachusetts. Because it will be a heavy, wet snow — especially at low elevations — there will be a risk of damage to tree limbs and power outages.\n\nHowever, with the storm still three days away, the predicted zone of heaviest snowfall could shift. Some models suggest that the snow jackpot zone could be focused farther north, from interior New York (including Albany) through Vermont and New Hampshire and into southern Maine. In this scenario, less snow would fall from central Pennsylvania into Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts.\n\nThe storm will follow an unusually mild weekend in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and even record-breaking warmth in some areas, where temperatures are forecast to reach the 50s and 60s. Abnormal warmth has swept through much of the nation this week while, as of Friday morning, snow covered only 27.6 percent of the contiguous United States — among the three lowest percentages on record for the date.\n\nCooler air moves into the Northeast on Sunday and Monday. But temperatures on Monday should still reach the 40s to near 50 along the I-95 corridor. A key ingredient for significant snow along I-95 is a zone of high pressure to the north over Canada that would funnel freezing air southward. But that ingredient is absent for this storm.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, temperatures should dip at least to the mid-30s from New York City to Boston. But whether they drop to right around or just below freezing depends on the precise track of the storm and how heavy the precipitation is. Heavy precipitation can chill the lower atmosphere by a few degrees, increasing the odds of more significant snow accumulation.\n\nSunday into Monday: The storm gets started with heavy rain late Sunday into Monday across portions of the Southeast, where 1 to 3 inches of rain could fall from the Florida Panhandle northward through Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. The Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center is highlighting an elevated risk for severe thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast both days, affecting New Orleans and Birmingham on Sunday and progressing to Tallahassee, Atlanta and Jacksonville on Monday.\n\nMonday evening into Tuesday: A mix of rain, snow, sleet and strong winds sweeps through coastal areas of the Northeast and New England on Monday night and Tuesday, while heavy snow falls in the interior. The precipitation should head out to sea by Tuesday evening, with gusty coastal winds lingering into Wednesday.\n\nRain should arrive Monday night, perhaps within a few hours of midnight, and could become mostly snow from the city toward points north and west Tuesday morning before tapering in the afternoon. A little sleet could mix in as well.\n\nA first guess is around a half-inch to 3 inches of snow in the city. But scenarios with more snow, perhaps as much as 3 to 6 inches, or less snow mixed with more rain, are still possible. The best chance of 3 inches or more is north and west of the city, while Long Island is likely to see less than an inch of snow or mostly rain.\n\nForecast confidence is low and thus subject to significant change, because of uncertainty in how heavy the snow will be and how cold it will get. Winds on Tuesday and Tuesday night could gust 30 to 40 mph around the city and 40 to 50 mph on Long Island.\n\nRain should arrive early Tuesday, probably after 2 a.m., potentially becoming mostly or all snow by around sunrise as temperatures drop to near or below the freezing mark, before moving out Tuesday evening. A little sleet could mix in as well.\n\nA first guess is around 3 to 7 inches of snow. But forecast confidence is low and thus subject to significant change, because of uncertainty in the exact storm track. So a little more snow than that is possible, as is less with more rain mixed in.\n\nIt looks like temperatures will remain above freezing, which should limit snow potential to around one inch or less, with the best chance of accumulating snow on grassy areas north of the city. But small changes in the storm track could change the forecast to a slightly snowier one.\n\nInterior snowfall could range from around 6 to 12 inches across much of central and northeast Pennsylvania, the Hudson Valley, Connecticut, parts of Rhode Island, central and western Massachusetts, and far southern New Hampshire and Vermont. Because it will be barely cold enough to support snow, heaviest amounts are probable in the higher elevations. Lesser amounts, around 3 to 6 inches, are probable for Western Maryland and portions of West Virginia.",

  "text": "This cataclysm was happening only in a computer simulation — the product of a complex model that scientists use to understand the effects of climate change. But it was the first time anyone had used this particular model to show how the Atlantic Ocean’s sensitive circulatory system can collapse, said Van Westen, a climate scientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. And it hinted that the ocean might be on course for a “tipping point” ending in abrupt and irreversible change.\n\nIt starts near the equator, where the surface of the ocean is warmed by the tropical sun. As that water moves northward, some of it evaporates, which increases the salt concentration — and the density — of the water that is left behind. By the time the water nears Greenland, it has also cooled down, which makes it even more dense.\n\nThe Gulf Stream plays a role in the AMOC, but the two are not synonymous. Whereas the AMOC is a complex system of many currents, the Gulf Stream is a single fast-moving current that carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico, along the east coast of the United States and across to northern Europe. It is driven primarily by winds and the rotation of the Earth, which means that even if climate change disrupts the deep ocean portion of the AMOC, the Gulf Stream won’t necessarily shut down.\n\nThink of it like someone leaning back in a chair. As long as they don’t lean too far, they are able to return to their original stable state, with all four legs of the chair on the floor. But if they tilt past a certain threshold — the tipping point — the chair will topple over, and they will be in a new stable state: lying on the floor.\n\nBut evidence from Earth’s past shows how an influx of freshwater could throw a wrench into the system. By studying sediments at the bottom of the ocean, scientists know that huge pulses of meltwater entered the North Atlantic at the end of the last ice age, as the massive ice sheets that covered Europe and North America started to disintegrate. The fossilized shells of tiny ocean organisms show how that pulse diluted the salty water that accumulated just below Greenland. That dilution made the water less dense, which prevented it from sinking, which meant there was nothing to push the deep ocean portion of the AMOC.\n\nThese observations have revealed a strange cooling spot at the southern tip of Greenland — one of the only places on the planet where the ocean isn’t getting hotter. This suggests that the AMOC isn’t delivering as much warm water to the North Atlantic and hints that the system is slowing down. Other studies have combined direct observations with computer simulations to conclude that the AMOC has already weakened by about 15 percent since the 1950s.\n\nIn their Science Advances study, Van Westen and his colleagues found that the amount of freshwater being moved around the southernmost portion of the Atlantic Ocean was a good indicator of the strength of the feedback system powering the AMOC. When that metric was a positive number, it meant that the system was self-reinforcing. But when Van Westen’s team looked at real-world data, it found that its measure of freshwater transport was negative.\n\nVan Westen’s study modeled how quickly the impacts of an AMOC collapse could unfold. Once the system passed its tipping point, he said, Western Europe would start to cool down by as much as 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) every decade. Sea levels in the North Atlantic would surge by up to a meter as water piled up in the region, and the bottom of the ocean would run short on oxygen — killing the creatures that live in its depths. Meanwhile, the rest of the world would continue to get warmer, thanks to humanity’s heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nClimate scientist Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, has also used computer models to assess how an AMOC shutdown could affect the world’s food supply. The dramatic cooling in the Northern Hemisphere would cause a shift in the band of clouds and rainfall that encircle the globe at the tropics. The monsoons that typically deliver rain to West Africa and South Asia would become unreliable, and huge swaths of Europe and Russia would plunge into drought. As much as half of the world’s viable area for growing corn and wheat could dry out.\n\nDespite the signs that the AMOC is getting weaker, scientists still can’t say how soon a shutdown might occur. The AMOC is huge and slow-moving — it would take a drop of water hundreds of years to cycle through the whole ocean — which means that a mere 30 years of observations is not enough to assess how much the system is changing.",

  "text": "Redfin launched the new feature this week. Users can find it in the “climate” tab above the listing, along with information about other environmental risks, such as fire, heat, drought and storms, which Redfin has included in its listings since 2021. As with information about schools, walkability and pricing history, the company says that understanding a property’s climate risks is essential for home buyers looking to make an educated decision, especially as those risks intensify. While poor air quality isn’t always as visible a threat as wildfires or hurricanes, the effects can accumulate over time and harm a person’s health.\n\n“Seeing all the data helps people quantify the risk when deciding if they’re going to live in one county or another county,” said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. “What’s probably going to happen over time is that [poor air quality] is just another type of weather that people either can adapt to, or they say it’s not worth it” and move to a different region. Recent studies have shown that wildfire smoke has had a significant impact on air quality, slowing or even reversing improvements made since the passage of the Clean Air Act.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Redfin, people are indeed moving out of areas with a higher risk of unclean air. The company studied U. S. Census Bureau data and air quality risk scores, finding that from 2021 to 2022, 1.2 million more people moved out of areas where at least one out of every 10 properties is at major, severe or extreme risk of poor air quality. That’s more than double the number of people who left those areas during the two previous years.\n\nCrucially, though, these high-risk places, such as Pierce County in Washington state and San Bernardino and Fresno counties in California, are largely clustered on the west coast, where housing costs continue to soar. The study notes that the majority of those decamping for other regions are motivated by affordability, not air quality woes.\n\nAnd they aren’t necessarily moving to parts of the country with better environmental prospects. Places such as Las Vegas, Orlando and Tampa are among the most popular destinations for people relocating because of affordability. While they offer a cheaper cost of living, they also face heightened climate risks, including severe heat, extreme winds, hurricanes and flooding, according to Redfin.\n\nTo determine the air quality risk of a given neighborhood, Redfin relies on First Street, a climate risk data firm that analyzes the number of poor air quality days expected in the current year and three decades into the future. It assigns each home one of six ratings, ranging from minimal to extreme.\n\nFairweather said there is reason to believe the new air quality data could influence buyer decisions. Before the company began including flood information in 2021, it ran a controlled experiment involving 17.5 million users. Half of them were able to see property-specific flood-risk scores, and the other half did not have access to that information. “In this experiment, people did use that flood information, and they ended up making offers on homes with half as much risk” as the homes they had previously been viewing, she said.\n\n“We know that people do use this information,” Fairweather said. “They are using it on some level to decide between one home or another.”",

  "text": "The United States and Canada throw out 32 tons of hair per day, according to a report from the waste management firm Green Circle Salons. But Kollar says there’s a better use for all those wasted locks: weaving them into clothing. In 2021, she launched a start-up, dubbed the Human Material Loop, to turn hair swept off the floors of salons and barbershops into fabric for clothes, curtains, carpets and furniture.\n\nKollar is part of a group of entrepreneurs and environmentalists looking for ways to recycle human hair. The wig industry has been putting long strands of cut hair to use for centuries. But more recently, companies and nonprofits have been turning shorter scraps of hair into fertilizer, using it to clean up oil spills or breaking it down into its essential amino acids for use in beauty products.\n\nHair is so common that we often forget how remarkable it is. It has a strength-to-weight ratio similar to steel: One head of hair could suspend two elephants in the air. It holds heat, sheds water and traps oil. It springs back into shape when bent and can stretch up to 70 percent of its length without breaking — a trait that once allowed Greek and Roman soldiers to braid human hair into elastic ropes for catapults.\n\nThat’s high praise from Meyers, who has dedicated much of his career to studying the structure of natural materials to find ways to put them to use or to draw inspiration for new products. Meyers has scrutinized tough but lightweight toucan beaks to come up with ideas for building airplane fuselages and studied the puncture-proof scales of the arapaima, an Amazonian fish that must fend off piranha bites, to suggest designs for body armor.\n\nMeyers, along with colleagues at UC San Diego and the Swiss research university ETH Zurich, studied the structure of human hair in 2017. He says hair’s strength and its tendency to spring back into its original shape could help strengthen building materials in the same way steel rebar reinforces concrete walls.\n\nBut even Meyers, who saw airplanes in toucan beaks and body armor in fish scales, hadn’t considered weaving hair trimmings into a sweater. “The hair of sheep has been used for thousands of years as insulation in clothing. Now, can you use human hair? This is a complex technological problem,” he said. “I don’t have any answers.”\n\nThe process involves treating the hair with chemicals, which clean it and change its color and texture so that it can be spun into yarn. Kollar says the chemicals are environmentally friendly and don’t pose a health hazard for humans or fish. The yarn can be dyed — any color but white, Kollar said — and woven into fabric like any other thread.\n\nAlthough some fashion designers have made artsy garments that emphasize the fact that they come from human hair (see below), Kollar has tried to make her fabrics look as normal as possible. “Many times if people hear a fabric is made out of human hair, they’re like, ‘Eww!’” she said. “But if I just show them a sample and say, ‘What do you think of this?’ they’re like, ‘Oh, it’s cool.’ And then when I tell them afterward it’s made of hair, it’s a very different reaction.”\n\nThere are two environmental advantages of weaving with human hair, according to Kollar. First, it keeps hair out of landfills and incinerators, where it would release greenhouse gases while rotting or burning. Second, it avoids the consequences of clearing land to grow cotton, drilling oil to make synthetic fibers or shearing wool from sheep, which belch tons of planet-warming methane.\n\nBut all the processing that comes afterward is expensive, especially because Human Material Loop is a start-up producing fabrics in small batches. Right now, Kollar says, her human hair fabric costs more than wool, cotton or polyester. “But once we reach a full-scale production, we can provide a very competitive price,” she said.\n\nFor the human-hair textile industry to take off, it would have to collect massive amounts of hair, which can be a logistical challenge. In India and Bangladesh, for example, the wig industry and fertilizer manufacturers rely on low-wage workers to sell their hair or collect it from salons.\n\n“There’s a lot of human labor involved in collection,” said Ankush Gupta, who teaches chemistry at the Homi Bhabha Center for Science Education in Mumbai and wrote a 2014 paper on the uses of recycled hair. “Depending on the country, the cost of collection will go up … so perhaps it will be difficult to make it profitable.”\n\nOne model for large-scale hair collection is Matter of Trust, a nonprofit that runs one of the biggest hair collection operations in the United States. It brings in hundreds of tons of hair each year to create mats that clean up oil slicks or fertilize soil. Over the past 25 years, the group has recruited a network of thousands of donors — including barbershops, hair salons and regular people collecting their own hair trimmings — who drop off or mail in bags of hair.",

And not in your car, office or coffee shop, either.\n\nThe research suggests that wearing computer headsets for long stretches could be risky to our brains, physical safety and social connections – and that the ways people have loved using the Vision Pro misjudge what the technology is best for.\n\nFew people are wearing the new generation of headsets, such as the $3,500 Vision Pro or Meta’s $500 Quest 3, for hours at a time. Bailenson said that researchers and technology companies need to pay attention to the benefits and downsides before the devices become widespread.\n\nImages are distorted; objects are farther away than they appear. Your field of vision is also narrower. But because you can see your surroundings, you might be overconfident.\n\nMy colleague Chris Velazco felt like he could move around a room normally while wearing the Vision Pro, but he repeatedly tripped. Bailenson compared it to walking while cupping your hands around your eyes.\n\nAfter only a few days of sales for the Vision Pro, some online posts appeared to show people wearing the goggles as they walked through a mall, rode a subway, lifted weights, crossed a street and drove a car. (These could be staged pranks.)\n\nThe research paper by Bailenson and his collaborators examined more than a century of research into wearing glasses or goggles that distort what we see. People generally adjust to the sensory distortions. Bailenson’s team found that, too.\n\nThe researchers couldn’t catch a ball at first when they wore headsets but they got the hang of it after 10 or 15 attempts. (They mostly wore the Quest 3. Some of them also tried the Vision Pro. Bailenson said the Vision Pro has fewer distortions but they’re still present.)\n\nThey did, however, alter how they threw the ball to compensate for the headset’s distortions. Bailenson is concerned about the warping effects of computer headsets during and after our use and the adaptations we’re forced to make.\n\nAnd he chafes at using headsets like the Vision Pro for hours to do office work or watch movies. But that is how Apple and Meta have imagined you’ll use their goggles.",

  "text": "Hope Tomkins lost almost everything in a tornado that destroyed her Iowa home in 2008.“When we got to our house, there were three walls left standing,” said Tomkins, who was about 30 miles away in Iowa Falls when the tornado tore through her community in Parkersburg. “It was indescribable.”The deadly tornado — which packed 205 mph winds — left dozens injured and killed nine people, including five of Tomkins’s neighbors.\n\nShe lost most of her possessions. One that particularly stung was a photo of Tomkins’s grandparents on their wedding day in 1942, which Tomkins had proudly displayed in her living room.\n\n“Does anyone recognize this couple? One of the many unclaimed tornado items from over the years,” the post — which included a timeworn photo of a young couple — said. “Cleaning out the closet at city hall and we found this! Let’s see if we can locate the family of the couple in this photo!”\n\n“I was in so much shock when the picture popped up,” she said, adding that she immediately called the Parkersburg City Hall to let them know the photo was hers. She also phoned her mother, Marcia Mull, whose parents are pictured. Mull was equally stunned.\n\n“I could not believe it,” said Mull, 76, who lived in Quarry, Iowa, when the tornado hit. She moved with her husband to an assisted-living facility in Parkersburg about a year ago, across the street from City Hall. She went right away to claim the photo.\n\nChris Luhring, Parkersburg City administrator, is the one who posted about the long-lost photo. He found it in a box of old items from the tornado that had been unclaimed.\n\nThat’s how the wedding photo landed in the city’s possession. Although Tomkins visited the lost and found on several occasions, she said, she never spotted the image of her grandparents, Maxine and Raymond Randall — both of whom grew up in Quarry.\n\nHer parents had a no-frills wedding, she said, adding that her mother wore a black dress because it was the only one she had. Their ceremony was at a local church, and there were just two people in attendance.\n\nMull’s father was drafted into the U. S. Army during World War II, shortly after the wedding, and was stationed in Normandy. He came back to Iowa in 1945 and worked at an appliance company for 33 years.\n\n“We were so thankful that we did get it back,” said Mull, adding that they’re planning to get it restored. They will also have several copies made.",

  "text": "RIGA, Latvia — A Russian military court on Tuesday sentenced Boris Kagarlitsky, a prominent sociologist, to five years in prison for criticizing the war in Ukraine — a shocking turnabout after another court originally ordered Kagarlitsky to pay a $6,500 fine but no prison time. The brutally toughened sentence was issued after an appeal from prosecutors, Russian state media reported, and it reflected a continuing harsh crackdown on the few dissident voices remaining in Russia after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKagarlitsky is the editor in chief of the Marxist online publication Rabkor and a university professor who has been designated as foreign agent, a label Russian authorities have attached to many of those who have criticized the war.\n\nThe previous court ruling, in mid-December, found Kagarlitsky guilty of “justifying terrorism” for an online post about a 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge, but levied only the fine as punishment. In many instances, defendants found guilty of criticizing the war now receive longer prison terms than those convicted of crimes such as rape or assault.\n\nIn the post that led to his arrest, Kagarlitsky said that the Crimean Bridge holds special symbolic meaning for “Putin’s era” and the “meaning” of Ukraine’s attack on it “from a military point of view is more or less clear” as it had disrupted Russian supplies to the southern part of the front line.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a post on Telegram, Kagarlitsky said that he was “in a great mood as always” after the new sentence was issued, and that he plans to continue collecting materials for new books, “including descriptions of prison life.”\n\n“Anyway, see you soon. I’m sure everything will be very good,” he wrote. “We just need to live a little longer and survive this dark period for our country.”\n\n“This verdict is a blatant abuse of vague anti-terrorism legislation, weaponized to suppress dissent and punish a government critic,” said Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s director for Russia. “By targeting Boris Kagarlitsky, a distinguished sociologist known for his critical stance against government policies, the Russian authorities are showing, once again, their relentless assault on all forms of dissent.”\n\nMoscow has cast a wide net against those who oppose the war in Ukraine. And on Tuesday, the Russian authorities sought to expand their reach, by adding Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas to a wanted list.\n\nThe spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, later explained that Kallas must answer for “crimes against the memory of the liberators of the world from Nazism and fascism,” adding: “This is just the beginning.”\n\n“Russia’s move is nothing surprising,” Kallas said in a post on X. “The Kremlin now hopes this move will help to silence me and others — but it won’t. The opposite. I will continue my strong support to Ukraine. I will continue to stand for increasing Europe’s defense.”\n\nKallas has been an unwavering supporter of Ukraine and has often called for more military assistance to Kyiv and tougher sanctions against Moscow. She has also advocated for the removal of monuments to Soviet World War II soldiers in Estonia. Russia considers the desecration or destruction of war memorials a crime under legislation that outlawed the “rehabilitation of Nazism.”\n\nLast fall, Kallas came under public pressure after Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported that her husband had remained a shareholder in a transportation company that was still operating in Russia after the invasion.\n\nKallas dismissed the reports as “a witch-hunt” by her political opponents, adding that her spouse is not a public figure and she cannot be held accountable for his business activities.\n\nHer husband, Arvo Hallik, said he sold his stake and resigned from the company. In November, Kallas was reelected to lead her party and has continued to push other European countries to sustain aid to Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have recently made confirmed advances south of Kreminna in the Luhansk region and around Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, according to the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\n\nBoth sides have been locked in a war of attrition for months, with Russian President Vladimir Putin betting on wearing out Ukraine and exhausting Western support two years into the war. In the West, there are mounting concerns about Ukraine running short of soldiers, and about depleted stocks of air defense ammunition.",

  "text": "A folksy, almost Santa-like figure who often donned a red vest or coat, Mr. Moore was immediately recognizable to anyone who ever bought a package of Bob’s Red Mill barley, bulgur or buckwheat. An illustration of his face, gently smiling under a flat cap and wire-rimmed glasses, adorns each of the company’s more than 200 products, alongside a salutation that conveyed some of the onetime seminarian’s easygoing charm: “To Your Good Health.”\n\nUnder Mr. Moore and his wife, co-founder Charlee Moore, the private company grew from an artisanal Oregon business into a global empire of stone-ground grains, cereals and flours, with annual sales of “well over $100 million,” Mr. Moore told podcast host Guy Raz in 2018. The company went on a hiring spree in 2020, buoyed by a surge of interest in baking during the coronavirus pandemic, and says it now has more than 700 employees, with sales in more than 70 countries.\n\nMr. Moore, who retired as chief executive in 2018 and continued to serve on the board until his death, was initially hesitant to embrace the health-conscious approach that his brand promoted from its founding in 1978. He once thought that gluten-free dieters “were nuts,” he said, and was skeptical of his wife’s interest in books like “Let’s Get Well,” by nutritionist Adelle Davis.\n\nWhile managing a J. C. Penney auto shop in Redding, Calif., Mr. Moore came across a library book, “John Goffe’s Mill,” in which Harvard anthropologist George Woodbury chronicled his attempts to restore a derelict mill that belonged to his family in New Hampshire. The book, with its evocative descriptions of traditional milling techniques and the glories of stone-ground flour and corn meal, inspired Mr. Moore to think that he might be able to run a mill of his own.\n\nMr. Moore began writing letters to millers across the country, seeking out antique equipment, and eventually acquired a few sets of 19th-century quartz millstones from a defunct mill in North Carolina. He went on to find modest success with his first milling company, Moores’ Flour Mill, which he founded in 1974 with his wife and two of his sons, working out of a vacant Quonset hut in Redding.\n\nBut a few years later, on the verge of turning 50, he decided to turn the milling business over to his children. He sold most of his possessions, moved to Portland, Ore., with his wife and enrolled at Western Evangelical Seminary, now part of George Fox University, where he sought to fulfill a long-held ambition of learning Hebrew and Greek so that he could read the Bible in two of its original languages.\n\nWithin six months, Mr. Moore was again seized by visions of stone-ground flour and grains. He and his wife were quizzing each other on Greek nouns and verbs, going over flashcards during a walk in nearby Milwaukie, a few miles south of downtown Portland, when they spotted an old mill and a “for sale” sign out front. Inside were bucket elevators and grain cleaners, along with virtually all of the milling equipment that Mr. Moore knew he needed to get started.\n\nUsing a set of 1870s millstones he acquired from another old mill, he soon launched Bob’s Red Mill. His wife did the bookwork and packaged many of the original products while Mr. Moore set to work promoting the business, getting on the evening news within a few weeks of opening the mill and filling the parking lot shortly after that.\n\nThe company grew with help from the Fred Meyer superstore chain, which began carrying its products in the Pacific Northwest. After a fire destroyed the mill in 1988 — an arsonist reportedly set the building ablaze — Mr. Moore moved the company into a larger plant in Milwaukie, expanding from about 18,000 to 60,000 square feet. Within a few years, the business was supplying wholesalers across the country. It started overseas sales in the early 2000s.\n\nFor years, Mr. Moore turned down prospective buyers, insisting on maintaining ownership of the company. In 2010, on his 81st birthday, he began transferring control to his staff through a new employee stock ownership plan. “The Bible says to do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” he later told Portland Monthly, explaining his belief that sharing profits and ownership would “make things more fair and more benevolent.”\n\nMr. Moore continued to come into the office daily, driving to work in one of his two 1931 Ford Model As, and sometimes played piano duets for visitors, performing Gershwin or Cole Porter songs with his executive assistant. More often he could be found checking the mill equipment, conducting product tests three times a day and singing the praises of old-fashioned techniques that he sought to marry with modern machinery.\n\nMr. Moore ran service stations in Gardena and Mammoth Lakes, Calif., before relocating to Sacramento, where he sold lawn mowers and hardware supplies at a Sears. For a time, he and his family lived on a five-acre goat farm, where Charlee baked with whole grains, raised chickens and tended to a garden. Mr. Moore described it as “heaven on earth.”",

  "text": "Genesse Moreno, 36, pulled up outside Lakewood Church about 2 p.m., walked inside with her 7-year-old son just before the start of a Spanish-language service and started shooting. The gunfire set off a panic in the cavernous building, with two off-duty officers confronting Moreno, who was wearing a trench coat, according to police and a search warrant executed early Monday.\n\nIn the ensuing moments, officials said, the boy was shot in the head and critically injured, and a male church employee was shot in the hip. Moreno was pronounced dead at the scene by the fire department.\n\nLocal and federal law enforcement officials, speaking at a news conference, said they believe Moreno acted alone. They said that a search of her home in suburban Conroe, Tex., about 50 miles north of Houston, had found “some antisemitic writings” that investigators will be “delving into.”\n\n“We believe there was a familial dispute that has taken place through her ex-husband and her ex-husband’s family, who are Jewish. That may be where some of this stems from,” said Christopher Hassig, commander of the Houston Police Department’s homicide special investigations unit.\n\nShe had also brought a .22-caliber rifle to the church but did not fire it, officials said. The car she drove there is being processed for evidence.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Moreno had a backpack, yellow rope and “substances consistent with the manufacture of explosive devices, which appeared to be a detonation cord,” according to police and the warrant. Investigators searched Moreno’s house — in Conroe’s Sterling Place subdivision — for evidence of a bomb hoax, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and/or possession of prohibited weapons, the warrant said.\n\nThough a post on Moreno’s Instagram indicated that she had once donated to Lakewood, the chief said it wasn’t clear why the shooter targeted the church or if she had any real connection to it. “I can’t speculate,” he said. “It could be any place of worship. Bad people or individuals suffering from mental illness, we all need to look out for.”\n\nOf the two off-duty officers who immediately responded, Adrian Herrera is employed by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission and Christopher Moreno (no relation to the shooter) by the Houston police force. The latter was working security for the church and wearing a body camera; investigators are now reviewing footage from that as well as from church security cameras.\n\nAt the briefing, Finner and the FBI special agent in charge were asked how Moreno was able to obtain guns when records show that a weapon was taken away from her in 2022 and that the FBI had questioned her attempt to purchase a weapon last year. Generally, Texas has few restrictions on gun purchases, with no firearm sales registry, no required waiting period to buy a gun and no red-flag law guarding against mentally ill or violent people having weapons.\n\n“That’s part of the investigation,” Finner said. “That’s the challenges that we have. That’s what law enforcement talk about all the time. We need to make sure everything is tight. We are not people standing up here against Second Amendment rights, but [against] people who are suffering from mental illness, criminals. We’re looking at that.”\n\nIntentional programs at faith-based organizations — especially at large churches, such as Lakewood — usually involve members who are in law enforcement, Chinn said. The average member would probably have been informed not to jump up and get involved in an incident, so that multiple people aren’t firing outside a coordinated plan, he noted.",

  "text": "The charismatic rebel leader, who in 2004 led the uprising that chased then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from the country for good, is now joining calls for Henry’s ouster. Freed last year from a U. S. prison, he has won the allegiance of an armed brigade in the Environment Ministry; called last month for “civil disobedience” across the country; and appeared in the capital on Tuesday alongside demonstrators demanding that the prime minister step down.\n\n“We’re telling the police and the army that we have zero problem with them whatsoever,” Jean Pierre Fritzner said in a video posted last week on social media. “If they put themselves against us, however, what happens to them is their responsibility.”\n\n“I’m sure there were legal considerations, so there were probably no legal options,” he said. “But I don’t know how people didn’t think outside the box and realize how devastating it would be to have him come back to Haiti, particularly this time.”\n\nIn the weeks since Philippe’s arrival, he has traveled the country to drum up support for a “revolution,” calling on Haitians to follow the example of protesters in Sri Lanka, who stormed the presidential palace in 2022 and forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign. He has railed against Western imperialism and pledged to end gang violence within 90 days. (He has declined to explain how.)\n\nHenry had not yet been sworn in when Moïse was killed in July 2021. But in the aftermath of the assassination, the Core Group, an informal bloc of envoys from countries including the United States, backed him to lead the country.\n\nHaiti hasn’t been safe for elections. Still, opposition leaders said Henry had to leave by that date, which was significant as the date in 1986 that Haitians pushed out the Duvalier dictatorship and, in 1991, swore in Aristide, their first democratically elected president. It’s enshrined in the constitution as the date for the presidential transfer of power.\n\nThe question now, Da Rin said, is whether Philippe’s call for a “revolution” will catch on beyond his traditional support. In the past, elites have taken advantage of rising social unrest to finance destabilizing demonstrations, but many of them are now under sanctions.\n\nA business leader in northern Haiti said Philippe had approached several people in the private sector for funding. The leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue, said those whom Philippe approached see in him for the first time “a real challenger to Ariel Henry.”\n\nThese people, he said, “are acting opportunistically, and are as damaging and destabilizing as the gangs.” These sectors have gone so far as to call for an insurrection and for civil disobedience, further aggravating the political dimension of the Haitian crisis.",

  "text": "MANILA — At least 55 people died and 32 were injured in one of the southern Philippines’ deadliest landslides in recent years, the government of Davao de Oro province said Monday. Search and retrieval operations are still underway for dozens more missing after the landslide that took place  Tuesday night on the southern island of Mindanao in the mining town of Maco, some 600 miles south of the capital, Manila. The death toll is expected to rise as the government verifies more dead and missing. A local official said during a live-streamed news conference late Monday afternoon that of the bodies that have been recovered, five  remain unidentified and that 51 people are still unaccounted for.\n\nThe landslide swept away three buses and a jeepney carrying miners and buried a village, according to authorities. The region was inundated by floods in the past week, hampering rescue operations. One of the survivors identified in recent days is a 3-year-old girl.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the U. S. Agency for International Development said it is providing about $1.25 million in humanitarian aid for communities hit by flooding and landslides in Davao de Oro and surrounding provinces on Mindanao.\n\nThe miners in the buses and jeepney, an elongated jeep-like vehicle widely used for public transportation, worked for the Philippine company Apex Mining, which operates a gold mine in Maco. The company said in a statement Saturday that it was assisting the government with relief and rescue operations.\n\n“The company is deeply saddened by this tragedy, and we can only imagine the pain that the families of the missing and the dead are going through,” said Luis Sarmiento, president and CEO of Apex Mining.\n\nEnvironmental groups have called for an independent investigation into the mining company. However, as of Saturday, government officials attributed the landslide primarily to heavy rainfall. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau said the affected area is outside the mining site, although the company’s transport vehicles were “temporarily stationed” there.\n\nLandslides occurred there in 2007 and 2008, according to local officials, but residents eventually moved back to be closer to their work, believing it was safe. Around 21 died in the last landslide, Edward Macapili, executive assistant for communications for Davao de Oro, told The Washington Post.\n\n“There is a policy that this is a no-build zone,” Macapili told radio station Teleradyo Serbisyo on Saturday. “After 2008, people went back, and it was tolerated by the previous administration of the provincial government of Davao de Oro and Apex Mining itself.”\n\nThe vulnerability of communities in hazard-prone areas is a common issue in the Philippines, an archipelago that is racked by such various disasters as earthquakes and typhoons.\n\n“People should not have been allowed to settle in that place, and there is no excuse for all who are responsible for allowing it,” said Mahar Lagmay, executive director of the Resilience Institute at the University of the Philippines. Lagmay urged the government to follow international guidelines on risk assessment and hazard mapping, not just for identifying danger zones but for spotting livable areas, too.\n\nExtensive rainfall in the southern Philippines has impacted more than a million people in the past week, leaving hundreds of thousands displaced, the U. S. Embassy in Manila said.",

  "text": "In his first statement on his recent cancer diagnosis, King Charles III expressed “heartfelt thanks” for the messages of support he received, while praising British cancer charities for their work.“As all those who have been affected by cancer will know, such kind thoughts are the greatest comfort and encouragement,” the British monarch said in a statement released Saturday evening.\n\nCharles also said it was “heartening to hear” that going public with his own illness had helped raise awareness of the disease and promote the work of cancer charities. “My lifelong admiration for their tireless care and dedication is all the greater as a result of my own personal experience,” he said.\n\nAlthough Buckingham Palace hasn’t yet disclosed what kind of cancer Charles has, his decision to eschew the usual royal practice of secrecy around health matters has already made him one of the world’s most famous cancer patients — and led many British people to look into their own risk of developing cancer.\n\nAccording to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, the cancer charity Prostate Cancer UK has seen a substantial increase in the number of people using its online risk checker for prostate cancer since Charles’s diagnosis was made public.\n\nThe charity recently posted a link to the test, along with a message wishing the king the best with his treatment.\n\nBuckingham Palace has said that Charles does not have prostate cancer, although doctors were alerted to an issue that led to his diagnosis while he was undergoing a procedure to treat a benign prostate enlargement last month.\n\nPalace officials also have not said what kind of treatment he is receiving or whether it includes radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nAnother U. K. cancer charity, Macmillan Cancer Support, recently said it hoped that by “sharing his diagnosis so publicly,” the king would “encourage others to reach out for support if they are concerned about cancer.” The statement was reposted by the royal family on social media with a green heart icon — commonly used to express support.",

  "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Four days after a shocking election result rattled Pakistan’s establishment, all eyes are on the powerful generals who have long been seen as the ultimate arbiters of politics in this country. Their grip, a constant since independence in 1947, suddenly appears in doubt, according to supporters of jailed ex-premier Imran Khan. Candidates backed by the former leader gained more seats in a general election last week than any other political bloc, posing a remarkable challenge to the establishment that appeared determined to suppress them.\n\nKhan’s party remains unlikely to be able to form a government because its candidates fell short of an absolute majority and other parties are unlikely to ally with it. They also all ran as independents and will be at a disadvantage in the complicated process of seat allocation that is expected to favor three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s party.\n\nBut the widespread perception among many Pakistanis that Khan’s party, Movement for Justice (known as Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI), is the real winner of last Thursday’s election could have deep implications for the delicate balance between Pakistan’s military and the country’s civilian leaders.\n\nFor many Khan supporters, their vote was as much about sending an anti-establishment message as it was about supporting the jailed former premier. “It is now evident that there is much anger against the establishment’s open and constant interference in civilian matters — interference which has only grown over the years because there has been no firm political consensus against it,” Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper wrote in a post-election editorial.\n\nAfter Khan ran afoul of the military two years ago, Pakistani officials all but dismantled his party. Many of its leaders were arrested — including Khan, who has been convicted in three separate cases so far — and the party’s offices were raided the week of the election.\n\nThe key question now is how the establishment will respond to their unprecedented failure to politically sideline the party: By further cracking down on Khan and his allies, or by trying to reconcile with the ex-premier they once backed?\n\nPakistan’s military is no stranger to challenges from civilian leaders and the public, however. It has weathered serious political storms in the past and reemerged more emboldened and with a seemingly even tighter grip on politics.\n\n“Some political leaders will always be willing to stand with the establishment and enjoy power,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a Pakistani political analyst. “This election result is a serious setback for the establishment, but ultimately it will prevail, as it has done in the past.”\n\nEven though Khan did not deliver on many of his core promises, as even some of his supporters acknowledge, the former prime minister’s appeal could grow further here if the next government excludes Khan’s allies and fails to boost economic growth.\n\n“We’re seeing a revolution,” said Shakir, 29, who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used because he works for a government department. But he cautioned that if Khan’s party does not come to power in the wake of this vote, fury may ultimately give way to despair and apathy. “Then nobody will come out and vote in the next election.”\n\nRarely have anti-establishment attitudes been so mainstream and been voiced so publicly than in the days since the vote. Objections to the voting process were raised across the political spectrum, and one candidate from a smaller, traditionally military-aligned party even objected to his own election victory, saying that he was unfairly handed a provincial assembly seat that should have gone to his PTI-backed opponent.\n\nStanding next to a shopping mall in Islamabad, Kashaf Mumtaz, a 26-year-old marketing freelancer, and 23-year-old medical student Shehzadi Najaf said it was clear to them that Khan’s party would not be allowed to return to power any time soon.\n\nBoth complained that the country’s military-dominated political system has neglected Pakistan’s younger generations of voters, continuing to elevate politicians such as Sharif, 74, who ran on a pro-business platform that has largely remained the same over the past three decades.\n\nMumtaz and Najaf pointed to the lengthy delays in vote counting as another symptom of the country’s political flaws. As PTI-backed candidates appeared to take a strong lead early Thursday night in unofficial polls published by media outlets, counting suddenly appeared to slow, prompting allegations of vote rigging and questions from international observers that remain largely unaddressed. It took three days for the final provisional count to be announced.",

  "text": "“The major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan to ensure the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there,” Biden said, referring to Israel’s publicly announced plans to invade the city. “Many people there have been displaced — displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north. And now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable. They need to be protected.”\n\nAbdullah was more direct. “We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to create another humanitarian catastrophe,” the king said. Referring to the war more broadly, he added: “We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end.\"\n\nThe joint comments by the president and the king Monday came after Biden met privately with Abdullah at the White House, the first face-to-face discussion the president has held with an Arab leader since the Israel-Gaza war began in October. The meeting came as U. S. officials have expressed deep concern about Israel’s plans to target the tiny town of Rafah, which borders Egypt and where about 1.3 million Palestinians are living in decrepit conditions after fleeing there under Israeli orders.\n\nDespite Biden’s growing willingness to publicly challenge Israel’s conduct of the war, he and his top aides have not publicly supported restricting aid to Israel or imposing conditions on it, as many of the president’s liberal critics demand. And while National Security Council spokesman John Kirby last week said an Israeli operation in Rafah “would be a disaster for those people, and we would not support it,” the White House has not threatened specific consequences if Israel proceeds with its plans.\n\nAn Israeli operation overnight Sunday in Rafah succeeded in rescuing two hostages, but it also killed at least 67 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, raising fears among Arab leaders that a sustained Israeli operation there could kill and injure thousands more. The planned Rafah operation has also escalated fears of a forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians, as Arab leaders fear they will be pushed into Egypt — a goal that far-right cabinet members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have openly embraced.\n\nAt a time when Biden has faced increasing criticism from Arab-American and Muslim voters angry over his staunch support for Israel and what they describe as a lack of empathy for Palestinians, Biden found a welcome ally in Abdullah. The president took the opportunity to highlight the suffering of the Palestinians, saying they are facing “unimaginable pain” and adding, “It’s heartbreaking. Every innocent life [lost] in Gaza is a tragedy, just as every innocent life lost in Israel is a tragedy as well.”\n\nJordan, whose population includes a large proportion of ethnic Palestinians, will almost certainly be key to any long-term American vision for the Middle East. Biden has said the war in Gaza must be followed by planning for a Palestinian state — a notion forcefully rejected by Netanyahu — and the United States believes that will require a thorough reform of the Palestinian Authority, which governs part of the West Bank. Jordan, which borders both Israel and the West Bank, would be central to any such effort.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has shown more willingness to take aim at the Israeli military operation in Gaza, last week calling it “over the top,” his strongest rebuke to date. But for months, Arab leaders in the United States and the Middle East have felt Biden’s public comments allowed little room for criticism of the hard-hitting military campaign.\n\nIsrael since then has mounted a fierce retaliatory campaign in Gaza, killing more than 28,000 Palestinians so far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. In addition, more than 80 percent of the territory’s residents have been displaced, and an Israeli siege has put hundreds of thousands of residents at risk of famine and disease.\n\nBiden and Abdullah have known each other for more than 20 years and have deep affection for each other, according to aides to both men. As vice president, Biden oversaw the Iraq portfolio for the Obama administration and made more than a dozen trips to the country. On each of those trips – either on the way over or the way back home – Biden stopped in Amman to visit Abdullah, Riedel said.\n\n“Abdullah can talk about all these issues in a level of candor that few other Arab leaders can because he knows Biden – they’ve been around together for a long time,” Riedel said. “I think he can be much more direct and candid. Part of the king’s objective here is to appeal to the empathetic part of Joe Biden and get him to show some empathy with the Palestinian people, which Biden needs to do for his own domestic political reasons.”\n\nThe conflagration in the Middle East, which has already spread to engage several Iran-backed militias in the region, carries the risk of significant political consequences for Biden. Arab Americans in Michigan and elsewhere are organizing to defeat him, and polls suggest that younger voters and people of color are deeply unhappy with his handling of the war.\n\nAbdullah’s trip to Washington is part of a tour to visit the United States, Canada, France and Germany, part of his effort to mobilize international support for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as well as the protection of civilians and for more humanitarian aid. Abdullah is also expected on Tuesday to meet senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as members of Congress.",

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday. Former president Donald Trump’s latest rhetorical grenade shook the West’s preeminent military alliance. Over the weekend, he said he would encourage Russia to attack U.S. allies in NATO if they failed to invest enough on their national defense. The remarks, as well as separate comments about ending U.S. aid to foreign countries, “set off fresh tremors across Washington and in European countries already worried about America’s reliability as an ally in a potential second Trump administration,” my colleagues reported.\n\nTrump has long grumbled about the United States’ outsize role in NATO and casts President Biden’s support for Ukraine’s struggle to resist Russian invasion as a costly drag on the U. S. taxpayer. The sentiment has captured a segment of the Republican Party, which has blocked the Biden administration’s attempts to earmark some $61 billion in fresh funding for Ukraine.\n\nTo European onlookers, Trump’s stated hostility is a line in the sand. “Everyone should watch this video from Trump and then understand that Europe may soon have no choice but to defend itself,” Norbert Röttgen, a senior German lawmaker and former chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German parliament, wrote on his Facebook page. “We have to manage this because anything else would be surrender and self-abandonment!”\n\nTrump, in the eyes of some European critics, is an existential threat to the Western alliance and its political ethos. “The current presidential campaign only confirms that he has not changed his reckless attitude towards allies,” Marko Mihkelson, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Estonian Parliament, told my colleagues. “Unfortunately, he is therefore a very convenient tool for Putin’s Russia, which is waging war against the West.”\n\n“Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U. S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n\nDuring his term, Biden reinvigorated the transatlantic alliance, assuring European counterparts about U. S. commitments to their security while coordinating a robust, collective effort to support Kyiv. European diplomats in Washington barely disguise their confidence and trust in the Biden administration, and their apprehensions of what may come should Trump defeat him in November.\n\nBut on the other key battlefront in the global conversation, Biden has unsettled myriad political elites with his perceived complicity in Israel’s relentless war against Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli campaign, which has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, many of whom were children, took another deadly turn Monday with the expansion of operations in Rafah, a southern city along the territory’s border with Egypt that’s now hosting more than a million cornered Gazan refugees.\n\nBiden is reportedly frustrated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s uncompromising approach to the conflict. But has resisted internal pressure from aides and Democratic allies to do more to restrain the Israeli campaign — which came after militant group Hamas’s invasion on southern Israel on Oct. 7 — let alone condition future military aid to the Jewish state.\n\n“Biden, who aides say has a visceral attachment to the Jewish state, has tended to view the prime minister and the state of Israel as one and the same, according to several people familiar with his thinking, and has struggled with the idea of criticizing a sitting prime minister, particularly during a time of war,” my colleagues reported.\n\nEven Europe’s top diplomat offered a thinly veiled rebuke of Biden’s muddled stance. “How many times have you heard the most prominent leaders and foreign ministers around the world saying too many people are being killed?” E. U. foreign policy Josep Borrell told reporters Monday, gesturing to Biden’s recent remarks that Israel’s conduct of the war was “over the top.”\n\n“If the international community believes that this is a slaughter, that too many people are being killed, maybe we have to think about the provision of arms,” Borrell added.\n\nBut Biden and many of his European counterparts have largely ignored calls from protesters and some lawmakers in their own countries to force a cease-fire or take action to thwart Israel’s latest offensive in Rafah. Also unheeded was an injunction from the International Court of Justice, the U. N.'s highest court, requiring Israel to take steps to better protect civilian life in Gaza. Some U.N. officials already believe Israel is in breach of those demands.\n\nAccording to a U. N. commission, one in every 100 people in Gaza was killed in the first 100 days of the war, a rate higher than any other armed conflict in the 21st century. “The ongoing war stands out as unprecedented in the scale of death, destruction, and suffering, with repercussions that will echo for generations to come,” noted the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.\n\nThe toll of the conflict has turned public opinion against Israel in much of the world. It has also sparked fury at Israel’s perceived Western enablers, chiefly the United States, for their selective approach to the “rules-based international order.” Biden has anchored this concept at the heart of why he claims the United States must defend Ukraine, arguing that Putin cannot be allowed to show that might makes right.\n\n“The Arab and Muslim world has lost faith in perceived Western norms: international law and institutions, human rights, and democratic values,” wrote Mohamed ElBaradei, former Egyptian diplomat and former head of the U. N.'s atomic agency, in a column last month. “In their view, the West itself is showing that brute force trumps all else.”\n\nThe stakes are arguably as high, perhaps higher, than what Europe is weighing when it comes to its future collective security. If the rules-based international order “publicly fails once again,” suggested Renad Mansour of Britain’s Chatham House think tank, “by proving incapable of agreeing an end to the unprecedented bloodshed in Gaza, it will further undermine the world’s faith in the institutions that were built to serve it, and possibly contribute to its complete unraveling. Western leaders should think very hard about this historic moment and what might come next.”",

  "text": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin underwent new medical procedures under general anesthesia on Monday to address a bladder problem that landed him back in the hospital over the weekend, the Pentagon said, as officials forecast he would resume his job duties soon. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters that doctors had performed “non-surgical procedures” on Austin, 70, related to an “emergent bladder issue.” Ryder declined to provide more information about what was entailed or what symptoms the defense chief had experienced before returning to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday, his third admission there since having surgery to treat prostate cancer in late December.\n\nIn an update shared by the Pentagon, doctors John Maddox and Gregory Chesnut said they would monitor Austin closely overnight. They described his cancer prognosis as “excellent” but did not say what caused the bladder problem.\n\n“We anticipate a successful recovery,” they said. Ryder, speaking at the Pentagon, said Austin was expected to remain in intensive care for the duration of his stay at Walter Reed, a medical complex outside Washington, but did not say how long that would last.\n\nAustin’s return to Walter Reed is the latest twist in a weeks-long saga over his health that has drawn intense scrutiny and raised questions about his handling of weighty national security duties and the limits of public officials’ right to privacy about medical matters.\n\nThe former Army general was criticized after news broke in early January that he had initially failed to notify the public, many of his top Pentagon aides and even the White House about his prostate cancer diagnosis, a subsequent prostatectomy and a later hospitalization for related complications that were severe enough to warrant a two-week stay at Walter Reed.\n\nAustin later apologized for the secrecy surrounding his health challenges, acknowledging that he should have shared more information given the need to ensure a seamless chain of military command. He is expected to appear before the House Armed Services Committee to testify about the episode later this month.\n\nAustin, who has been undergoing physical therapy as part of his recovery from his earlier hospitalization, also had been scheduled this week to make his first official trip since returning to the Pentagon. Given his hospitalization, officials said Monday that his trip to Brussels was canceled.\n\nRyder said the bladder issue was not related to Austin’s cancer but declined to say whether it was linked to the complications from his prostatectomy that caused his hospitalization beginning Jan. 1 or to something else.\n\nOliver Sartor, an oncologist who was not involved in Austin’s care, said the Pentagon’s disclosures are consistent with a bladder outlet obstruction, which essentially means you cannot urinate normally.\n\nThe urethra runs through the center of a prostate to connect to the bladder. After removing the prostate in a prostatectomy, a surgery that some men undergo because of prostate cancer, doctors must connect the urethra to the bladder, which can lead to complications, including urine leaks and obstructions.\n\nEstimates range widely for how prevalent that complication is after a prostate-removal procedure, but Sartor described it as a “plausible” outcome. The obstruction can be fixed with a cystoscopy, a non-surgical procedure.\n\n“It’s not a terribly big deal, but it’s really important, and you need to do it quickly,” said Sartor, who specializes in prostate cancer and practices at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “It’s unfortunate that a complication has developed, but based on the information provided, it seems like he should be able to make a full recovery.”",

Since the early 1970s, a group of 16 women have met up every December to celebrate their friendshipTen of the 16 women of the Sugar Hill Sisterhood sing together in front of Elkton Hall at the University of Maryland at College Park. (Video: David Carter for The Washington Post)They got ready for parties and shared countless laughs as freshmen inside the cramped rooms of Elkton Hall, a high-rise dormitory at the University of Maryland at College Park. They bonded over being Black women at a university where, in 1971, Black students made up only 4 percent of the student body. Friends dubbed the tightknit group of young women “Sugar Hill,” and the name stuck. “It was unique for that many African American females to be in one place,” said Elizabeth Gholston, 71, one of the early members of the group who now resides in Northwest Washington. “During that time, you needed that kind of camaraderie and cohesiveness.”On Dec. 14, 1973, the women, most of them college seniors, gathered to celebrate a birthday and an early graduation. But it wasn’t the end of the friend group. Before the evening was over, they had decided that the group should meet again in December the following year. They never imagined where the new tradition would take them.For the past 50 years, the women have continued to meet at least once a year for dinners, weekend sleepovers and vacations around the world. The Sugar Hill Sisterhood, as they now call themselves, has expanded to 16 women who have leaned on one another through five decades of milestones — weddings and graduations, baby showers and funerals.There’s no challenge too big for the sisterhood, said Everene Johnson-Turner, 71, who now lives in Columbia, Md., and attended the first December dinner. “I could call in the troops in a minute,” she said. “They would be there for me.”The enduring nature of female friendship has been well documented. Research shows that female friendships tend to be deeper than those of men, and women are more likely to rely on friends in addition to their spouses for support, said Marisa Franco, an assistant clinical professor at the University of Maryland and author of “Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make — and Keep — Friends.”While many people have friendships that span decades, the women of Sugar Hill are something of a case study in what it takes to maintain them. Although the bond among the women of Sugar Hill was forged during their college years, they say they have worked hard to stay connected and nurture their relationships. A daily WhatsApp group chat helps them stay in touch, as do phone calls, video chats and remote group activities like a 90-day fitness challenge. They are committed to their annual reunions and have maintained unwavering support for one another.“The character of all the women in this group is top-notch,” said Jonetta Hill, 71, who now lives in the Virgin Islands. “People are in awe that all these women in all these years, we haven’t had a fight, we haven’t had a breakup or anything like that. We respect each other’s individuality.”While the Sugar Hill reunions began with annual dinners, they later evolved to overnight stays at one another’s houses and then trips together around the world. The women say that whatever is going on in their lives, they can look forward to spending time with the Sugar Hill Sisterhood every December.The Sugar Hill Sisterhood has toured the world together, with trips to Jamaica, Spain, Italy, the Bahamas, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Argentina and Portugal, among many other places. In December, the group marked the 50th anniversary of the December reunions with a trip to Grenada.“These trips are meaningful because for a lot of years that was the only vacation I had,” said Cassandra Stewart, a 71-year-old who lives in Baltimore. “We have the best time ever, and it really sets the tone for my year. When I’m with them, it’s going to be nothing but good times.”To make sure the trips and reunions keep happening, the group each year designates someone who is responsible for selecting the location, figuring out the transportation and planning the activities. That person can organize the trip by themselves or in a committee with a few other women. Hosts are selected based on a rotation, and before the reunion is over, it is determined who will plan the following year. Once the destination is decided, there are no complaints.“It’s an unspoken agreement to not say anything discouraging about the choice of location,” said Linda Evans Cheek, 72, of Hyattsville, who also lived in Elkton Hall during her college years. “If you want to go somewhere when it’s your turn, we’ll go there.”The reunion coordinator will send a notice in mid-March or early April about the destination of the trip along with an estimate of the total cost, said Joyce Wynn Dawkins, 71, a former Elkton Hall resident who lives in Laurel, Md. Planning ahead is part of the fun.“The really key thing I loved about it was the excitement that nobody knew what they were going to do until the invitations went out,” Dawkins said.The daily group chat is lively and eclectic. Messages include prayers, inspirational quotes and life updates, Dawkins said. “Time and friends are two things that become more valuable, the older you get,” read one message.When it’s someone’s birthday, the group chat is filled with GIFs, emojis and well wishes. If the women ever need to have a deeper conversation, they will jump on a video call, like they did on Fridays during the height of the covid-19 pandemic.And if someone in the group mentions she isn’t feeling well, she knows she will hear from the others.Helen Jackson James, a 71-year-old resident of Columbia, Md., recently experienced a throbbing headache and mentioned it to Quentess Elizabeth Davis of D.C., whom she has known since middle school. The two, along with Novella Jones Sherman of Mitchellville, Md., originally became part of the Sugar Hill Sisterhood while they were students who commuted to the University of Maryland campus.Almost immediately after complaining about her headache, James started receiving concerned texts and calls from other women in the group. “They were on top of me, asking: ‘Did you go to the doctor? Did you go to the emergency room?’” said James, who later got a head scan and a clean bill of health. “They help me maintain my health and positive mind. We give each other strength, and when there’s something challenging for us, we try to lift that person up.”In the late 1970s, Dawkins’s boyfriend died in a car accident. She had moved back to Baltimore and was mourning the loss when one of the Sugar Hill sisters, Sheila Perkins-Hawkes, persuaded Dawkins to come back to D.C. and live in an apartment with her. They stayed roommates for the next few years. “She nurtured my soul,” Dawkins said. “That’s all I can say. She let me cry when I wanted to cry.”Stewart, a Baltimore native, befriended most of the women through Dawkins, whom she met in high school. The sisterhood was there for Stewart at her lowest moment nearly 40 years ago when the nonprofit where she worked closed its doors. She was without permanent employment for two years, and her friends in the sisterhood sent her cards, covered her dinners and even helped pay for her to attend the reunion trip that year.“That meant the absolute world to me,” Stewart said. “I don’t remember ever being that low in my life. It was just how they kept me encouraged. They just made me feel good about myself at a time where I didn’t have that at all. I don’t have any biological sisters — I have all brothers — but I don’t think I could’ve picked a better group of sisters.”Perkins-Hawkes, 71, a native of D.C. who grew up with several friends in the group, said she has leaned on the friend group to get through everything from “bad boyfriend breakups” to “my joys, my sadness, times when I’ve fallen and needed to be picked up.”And they can count on her for the same support. “If you call me up and you need me, I’m coming,” she said.The group continues to debate the origins of their name. Several said they believe it was started by male friends on campus. “Sugar” was a term of endearment toward the women, while “hill” referred to the fact that they lived on the top floor of Elkton Hall. “It was all girls, and we were supposed to be all sweet sisters,” said Angie Page, 71, of Ellicott City, Md. “Sugar is sweet and we were young ladies up there.”Group members say their name has become part of their identity and now extends to family members. Husbands are referred to as “sugar daddies,” Johnson-Turner said. Children are “sugar babies,” and grandchildren are “sweet tarts.”“Everything we call our families have to do with sugar,” said Johnson-Turner.The Sugar Hill friendships now span generations. The friends support one another’s children and grandchildren, and the children of the sisterhood also spend time together. “It’s a great feeling knowing that we’ve passed the Sugar Hill legacy to our offspring and they are passing it down to their offspring,” Dawkins said.And when Dawkins got married in 1985, Cheek’s husband explained to her fiancé that his commitment extended beyond his fiancée. “Just make sure you want to do this,” Dawkins recalls him saying at the time. “You’re marrying her, but you’re marrying 15 other sisters as well.”“He was laughing,” Dawkins said, “but he was right.”Well+Being shares news and advice for living well every day.

  "text": "First, a man rams a skateboard into the passenger window of a white vehicle. He exits the frame, then returns and slams his drink container into the windshield. Bystanders can be seen cheering the people vandalizing the car, as others record on their phones. Soon the car is engulfed in flames.\n\nScenes of chaos from San Francisco’s Chinatown spread across social media Sunday after a mob vandalized and set fire to a Waymo self-driving car using a firework on Saturday evening. Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, has been offering Californians a 24/7 taxi service in driverless cars since the summer.\n\n“Waymo Vehicle surrounded and then graffiti’d,” the San Francisco Fire Department said on social media hours later. “Windows were broken, and firework lit on fire inside the vehicle which ultimately caught the entire vehicle on fire.”\n\nPhotos uploaded by the fire department, which later reminded people that using fireworks is banned in San Francisco, showed the vehicle in flames and later its charred remains.\n\nOfficers responded to the fire at about 8:50 p.m. local time, the police statement said. When the officers arrived, the unoccupied car was “engulfed in flames,” according to the statement, which added that there were no reports of injuries.\n\n“Chinatown is one of the densest neighborhoods in San Francisco, and any fire could explode and spread among tightly-packed buildings to endanger lives, homes and businesses,” she said in a statement Monday afternoon.\n\n“People could have been hurt and most importantly, this was the day of the Chinese Lunar New Year,” Peskin said. “This is one of the most important days for families, there were thousands and thousands of tourists here, partaking in the events.”\n\nA Waymo spokesperson told Reuters that the passenger-less car was moving along a street in Chinatown when people surrounded it. Later someone threw a firework inside, setting the fire, the company said.\n\nAlthough cars without drivers have become a common sight on San Francisco’s winding and sloping streets, there are long-standing tensions between the city’s residents and the cars.\n\nA Waymo vehicle struck a cyclist last week in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, resulting in minor injuries, the Verge reported. The Waymo passenger was unhurt, and the cyclist left the scene on their own.\n\nDriverless cars have caused major concerns in San Francisco by disrupting first responders on multiple occasions, including driving into scenes cordoned off by caution tape and striking a firetruck responding to an emergency, The Post previously reported.\n\nLast year, a robotaxi operated by Cruise — a Waymo rival — rolled over a pedestrian and dragged her about 20 feet, after which the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended its operations. Days later, the company said it would suspend all driverless operations in the country to examine its process and earn back public trust.\n\nIn four videos uploaded by witness Michael Vandi, who heads Addy AI, an AI company, a man who is using his jacket to cover his face can be seen scribbling on the back of the car with what appears to be a sharpie. Others in the crowd appear unmasked. An unidentified voice encourages others to light the vehicle on fire.\n\nOnce the car is set on fire, however, people appear to back away from the vehicle. The Post could not access footage of the moment when the firecracker was thrown inside the car.\n\nVandi told Reuters in a direct message on X, formerly Twitter, that people were celebrating the Lunar New Year on Saturday evening by setting off fireworks. He said he saw a person jump onto the hood of the vehicle and break its windshield, and another later jumped onto the hood as the crowd clapped. Vandi could not be reached for comment Monday morning.\n\n“That was when it went WILD,” he wrote. “There were 2 groups of people. Folks who encourage it - and others who were just shocked & started filming. No one stood up - i mean there wasn’t anything you could do to stand up to dozens of people.”",

  "text": "Dictionary.com on Tuesday announced it had added more than 1,700 new or updated definitions — and with a range from “girl dinner” to “Barbiecore,” “slow fashion” to “climate breakdown,” they reflect online trends, health and well-being, social issues, anxieties over climate change and the economy, and more.\n\n“The intersection of language, learning and culture is boundless, and we recognize that words have the power to shape thoughts, bridge gaps and reflect our ever-evolving society,” John Kelly, vice president of editorial at Dictionary.com, said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nNot all the words are based on new trends, and some may have wider meanings than listed here; Dictionary.com says it adds words when its experts decide that they are used widely and largely in the same way, are likely to stay, and are useful for a general audience.\n\nThat dictionary’s team is “always monitoring” language usage, she said during a Tuesday phone interview, and, in addition to adding new words, also spends time “identifying existing words which are being used in new ways.”\n\nOne example of that was Cambridge Dictionary’s 2023 word of the year, “hallucinate,” which refers to when artificial intelligence produces false information. (Dictionary.com named “hallucinate” its 2023 word of the year, too.)\n\nThat was “one of a large number of AI-related updates” made by the Cambridge Dictionary last year, Fletcher said. “We all recognized that everyone was talking about AI, and we felt that the word ‘hallucinate’ as a word really got to the heart of why they were talking about it.”\n\nAccording to Tony Thorne, a lexicologist and language consultant at King’s College London, these types of lists have their own limitations, as they involve attempting to keep up with trends — which is in itself a “quite a difficult job.”\n\nDictionary.com says its own lexicographers “track a vast number of terms and topics, read a wide variety of writing and transcribed speech, and use corpora (big, searchable collections of texts) to see how terms are actually being used.”\n\nAnother issue is the inherent difficulty in trying to assess new forms of language, and the vast array of new terms that are being used, particularly online, Thorne said.\n\n“It’s impossible for any linguist to say how important a new term is, how long it’s going to last, how significant it is,” he said. “So that’s why a lot of the new terms that they add are not new terms but have usually been around on social media, on TikTok, in conversations, for some time — sometimes years — before they’re accepted into the dictionary.”\n\nThere’s also a generational component when looking at new words or expressions, as much of the language “is baffling at first sight, and most people over 30 are entirely ignorant of it and ignore it, or they ridicule it if they see it.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nWhy do people love D. C.? Reader letters show a deep affection for the city.In honor of Valentine’s Day, we asked readers to tell us what they love about living in D.C. The answers we received were buoyant, heartfelt and inspiring. Readers highlighted the people, the places and the vibes of the city; some even sent photos to illustrate the deep affection they have for it. Their letters to the District and surrounding areas remind us that, while many things can bring us down, there’s still plenty to appreciate.Reader letters have been lightly edited for length and clarity.When I was just a kid, I met you and I realized all I had known my whole life was winter. I came here, and for years I sat on top of a hill reading books and it was brighter and warmer and sweeter than anything I’d ever done — and at the time I didn’t even know you were to thank. I thought it was magic.Not magic, just drinking sunlight in November. Not magic, just a pretty city full of pink trees on the water. Not magic, just a skip and a hop (and a track) from my friends’ places in all directions. Not magic, just a friendly old lady who runs the import store and compliments my pronunciation. Not magic — just us, all walking your sunny spine.Have you heard someone really famous lives here? (Don’t be shy. They’re not all that.)D.C., I love you. I miss you when I’m gone. After years and years, I still climb to the top of that hill to see you down below, collecting puddles of sun. I’m lonely without you. Do you know how I can prove it’s for real? Let me prove it, let me say it plain: D.C., I love you in the summer.— Sasha Jovanovski, 24, Foggy Bottom, has lived in D.C. for more than six yearsLove living in D.C. for so many reasons! Beautiful architecture, well-educated people, great neighborhoods and restaurants, a pretty good public transportation system, and did I mention the abundance of mostly free and world-class museums?— Corinne Axelrod, 68, Cathedral Heights, has lived in D.C. for four yearsI love that you are the city that is the keeper of most of the country’s history.I love that you, the city, house so many monuments and memorials to our nation’s most prominent leaders, historical landmarks and major buildings where our top leaders govern from.I love that when I travel away from the city and fly back to DCA or drive home, the first sites to greet me are the proud Washington Monument and the dome of the Capitol to the side, all sitting along a sparkling Potomac River, which is bejeweled by the Kennedy Center and Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials.I love that this city is where so many people move and come for their occupations because there is a lot of important work happening in the federal government.I love that you, the city of D.C., are the center of so many things in our country and that I, as a resident of this place, can observe it all up-close and participate in it.— Stephen Padre, 51, Petworth, has lived in D.C. for almost 15 yearsWhile I think I could write at least 1,100 words in sharing what I love about the District, I’ll try to keep it brief. My No. 1 favorite aspect of living here has to be access to public transportation. WMATA is doing a fantastic job, and I consider it a privilege to not need a car. Not to mention, this new-to-me way of commuting has offered a new, dedicated hobby: I read a book every minute I’m on a bus or train. I’ll also throw an honorable mention to bike lanes, particularly in Ward 6.— Taylor Cogan, 34, Capitol Hill, has lived in D.C. for more than a yearWith the exception of four years in Illinois, north of Chicago, I have lived here since 1964 — including a year in Prince George’s County, two years in D.C. and the rest of the time in McLean and Vienna. I think that behind the formidable white government buildings and ongoing news events occurring between the Capitol and the White House, the area is basically a wonderful conglomeration of small towns.When you settle into one of those “towns,” you come to really know your neighbors; your kids and their kids go through all the school years together and you know you belong to a real community … a community that may contain people you suddenly see on TV, or neighbors who on first meeting realize they’ve met elsewhere in the world. I love that wonderful, eclectic mix.— Catherine L. Gaugler, 80, Vienna, Va., has lived in the D.C. area for almost 60 yearsI love that I can walk into Rock Creek Park and feel like I’m on a hike in the country within five blocks of my house. It’s the secret that tourists don’t know about — and RCP isn’t the only place this is true. Nature is a big deal in D.C.I should also add that there’s nothing quite like hearing lions, tigers and gibbons from your living room when you live next to the National Zoo!— Sarah Jencks, 49, Mount Pleasant, has lived in D.C. for 20 yearsI am a country girl by birth. I grew up on a Hereford cattle ranch in the Sandhills of Nebraska and rode a little brown pony named Dimples 3½ miles to school each day for the first six years.But I have always been fascinated by cities. They have a beat and a pulse, a diversity that attracts me. Cities have texture — old houses, tall glass office buildings, unpredictable angles and spaces — places where it seems possible for something interesting or unexpected to happen — sort of a nubby texture.And, D.C. has a nubbier texture than most. There are the “sightings” of the people you see on the national news each evening: Bob Dole shopped at my Safeway, David Broder walked by my apartment building each day, Condoleezza Rice had her nails done where I did.And Washington is a beautiful city — the monuments, the mall, the cherry blossoms, the Potomac winding its way throughout. When I ran along the Potomac in the early morning, and returned across Memorial Bridge, for one brief glorious moment, the sun came up ahead of me illuminating the Jefferson Memorial, the dome of the Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and to my left the turrets of Washington National Cathedral and the spires of Georgetown University. It was a breathtaking sight and I never failed to marvel at it.Part of each workday was the commute by Metro that required me to change trains in the center of the city. It kept me in touch with the realities of this city that I love. On my way, I passed the homeless men just leaving breakfast at the church across the street. And each morning as I left Union Station to walk to the Russell Building, I encountered the trumpet player who played “Winter Wonderland” on snowy mornings and “Hot Mama” on steamy, humid afternoons. I passed the Cat Woman, her face painted white with black whiskers, wearing a threadbare yellow winter coat.These people kept me in touch with the fact that not everyone has a college degree, not everyone wears a suit and tie, or eats three meals a day, and not everyone who is poor or homeless is a bum or a thief.Yes, it is the nubby texture of D.C. that I love. And now that I am retired and walking with a cane, I agree with Queen Elizabeth II who said, “Good memories are our second chance at happiness.”— Vivian Otteman, Foggy Bottom, has lived in D.C. for 33 yearsI love living here for the history, the natural beauty, and the amazing food scene. Like many D.C. transplants, I came down in the early 2000s for college and never left. I came from a small town and was excited to move to a real city. I’m not sure where I thought I’d end up after college, but I am so glad I stayed.I love sharing my city with friends and family when they visit! Especially surprising them with all the non-touristy things you can do. It does amuse me when they are in awe at the military airplanes and helicopters — things I barely even notice half the time because it is such a common occurrence.— Corrine Melissari, 40, Alexandria, Va., has lived in the D.C. area for more than 20 yearsI was born and raised in this town. I have lived here for 47 years and loved it for 47 years. I love my neighbors and my neighborhood. I love the little parks throughout the city, the number of trees almost everywhere, the flowers in the springtime and the height limit on the buildings. I love the rich food culture we have in the city. And I love go-go.— Sarah S., 47, Brookland, has lived in D.C. for 47 yearsMy car was side swiped beyond repair a year ago. Thankfully, I was not in it. I love living in D.C. because you can still have a lot of fun without a car! For example, so far this winter, I’ve gone to the National Museum of Asian Art, seen plays at Studio and Arena, gone ice skating at the Sculpture Garden Ice Rink, watched the MLK Parade in Anacostia to cheer on my Mason friend, auditioned for a play at St. Mark’s Players on Capitol Hill, gone to three restaurants for restaurant week, visited the Capitol and taken a train to Baltimore — all without a car.— Justin Latus, 55, Capitol Hill, has lived in D.C. for more than 30 years‘We were going to become part of history’My husband and I met at George Washington University as summer school students in 1963 and our first date consisted of joining others marching in August to the Lincoln Memorial. Unbeknownst to us at the time, we were going to become part of history. We heard Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech and Marian Anderson sing, “He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands.”We were married at Grace Lutheran Church on 16th Street in 1970. Both of us knew back then that we could never leave D.C. because as my husband says, “This place is the center of the universe.”We plan to be interred at Arlington National Cemetery in the columbarium so we can both boast of a long commitment to this city that we love so well.— Kathy Megyeri, 81, Upper Northwest on Oregon Ave., has lived in D.C. for more than 60 yearsIllustration by Emma Kumer.

  "text": "Using old family documents and consulting with historical societies, Mills’s sister uncovered details about Ned Mills, who grew up on a plantation in Georgia in the 1830s. He was enslaved until June 19, 1865 — the day the Union army arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared all enslaved African Americans in the state were free. He then toiled for the rest of his life as a farmer and blacksmith.\n\n“It was an emotional experience as I walked past this pristine, well-kept cemetery,” Mills said, adding that just a few of his family members had proper grave markers. “I only exist because these people were able to persist. I started being very prideful of these people who were treated poorly in life and in death.”\n\n“I spent most of my life not asking questions about African American history and not really being taught about it,” said Mills, who works as a software architect and launched a nonprofit in 2022 called the Alex Breanne Corporation — named after his daughter — to help support his research projects. “I’m doing this work now, and it’s hard work. I run into a lot of problems with a lack of documentation.”\n\nMills took a genealogy course at Boston University last year to advance his investigative skills. Through rigorous research over the past two decades, he has found harrowing details about dozens of enslaved people and African American Civil War veterans. In some cases, he has connected with their descendants — most of whom, he said, were unaware of their own family history.\n\nOne of the most interesting cases Mills has worked on, he said, is the story of Thaddeus and Mary Newton. They were the parents of Alexander Heritage Newton, an abolitionist and Civil War soldier. Although Alexander Heritage Newton’s own story is somewhat known, “there’s little to no knowledge of his parents, and I think his parents are the story,” Mills said. “The story of these individuals has never been told in its totality.”\n\nMills also contacted the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs to acquire a headstone for the Newtons’ son Stephen, who fought and died in the Civil War and whose remains were not recovered. It is expected to be installed next to Thaddeus and Mary Newton’s restored headstone this spring.\n\nMills’s organization is working on several other projects, including one that relates to his own lineage. Through his research, he learned about William Cooper — his third-great-grandfather on his mother’s side. He served in the Union Navy during the Civil War and enlisted in Baltimore in 1864. He was aboard the USS Wyalusing when it took possession of Fort Williams from the Confederacy and reclaimed Plymouth, N. C. — a significant region during the war, given its proximity to the Roanoke River.\n\nMills also petitioned to have a street in Middletown, Conn., renamed to honor an enslaved man named Prince Mortimer, who lived there. Through his research, Mills found that Mortimer was enslaved until he was 87, then sentenced to life in prison after being accused of attempting to murder his enslaver. He died in prison at age 110 and was supposedly buried in the prison’s cemetery, though Mills’s research has pointed him to a different conclusion: He believes Mortimer’s remains were sent to a medical institution. Mills’s effort to rename the street was chronicled last year in the Middletown Press.",

The George Washington University associate philosophy professor is giving a lecture on some of love’s biggest mysteries and paradoxes: Do those we love need to be lovable? Is love a morally sound act? How does our societal understanding of love shape our experience of it? Papish will start with a look at how ancient Greeks thought about erotic love and move forward in time, through our current pop culture. Presented by Profs and Pints, the talk is held at Penn Social (where drinks are discounted until 7 p.m.). Whether you come lovelorn or in love, you might learn why. Feb. 12 from 6 to 8:30 p.m. Penn Social, 801 E St. NW. profsandpints.com. $13.50 in advance or $17 at the door.",

  "text": "Mr. Edwards, who died Feb. 10 at 76, stayed at “Morning Edition” for nearly a quarter century and became as much a part of the begin-the-day rhythms for NPR listeners as coffee, commutes and getting the kids off to school. Then in 2004, a decision by NPR to pull Mr. Edwards from the show touched off an avalanche of complaints from his fans that even included statements on the Senate floor.\n\nBoth his long NPR run and the uproar over his departure reflected Mr. Edwards’s deep influence on public radio as it moved from the margins of the national conversation to become a mainstay. His “Morning Edition” interviews — more than 20,000 from 1979 to 2004 — served as an audio scrapbook for a generation and helped establish NPR as a forum for guests to make news or raise their profile.\n\nMr. Edwards interviewed diplomats and autocrats, scientists and artists, the quirky and the powerful. He conducted regular check-ins with personalities such as a former veterinarian turned cowboy poet, Baxter Black, and the wondrously erudite former Major League Baseball announcer Red Barber, who might talk about sports or maybe describe how the lovely dogwoods were blooming outside his home in Tallahassee.\n\n“Red Barber loosened me up, took me off-script,” Mr. Edwards recalled. His book about their collaboration, “Fridays With Red: A Radio Friendship” (1993), was as much about Barber as it was about Mr. Edwards’s fascination with radio — which began as a kid in Louisville perched in front of a hulking 1939 Zenith Long Distance Radio in its polished mahogany case.\n\nAt “Morning Edition,” he found his place as one of NPR’s most versatile and popular hosts. He pushed his producers to limit interviews with politicians (too predictable, he said) and seek out more artists, activists and lesser-known newsmakers. The goal, he noted, was to find guests who aren’t just spewing rage or talking points.\n\n“This may be a little island of civility and purpose,” he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1999. Once, Julia Child and Paul Prudhomme joined other famed chefs to share Thanksgiving recipes with Mr. Edwards. In 1999, Mr. Edwards chatted with Baseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays about playing in the fog and swirling winds of San Francisco’s Candlestick Park. (Not so easy, Mays said.)\n\nThat also may have contributed to his undoing at NPR, Harrison said. By 2004, the pre-taped interview format of “Morning Edition” was increasingly regarded as out of sync with demands for more breaking news coverage. This was not Mr. Edwards’s forte, said Harrison, and Mr. Edwards often seemed uncomfortable when forced into live situations (except for his easy banter with Barber).\n\nFor weeks before his final broadcast, the backlash to NPR’s decision boiled over. NPR received tens of thousands of calls and emails protesting the move, some claiming ageism (Mr. Edwards was 56) and noting the extra sting that NPR did not let Mr. Edwards reach his 25th anniversary on “Morning Edition.” A website gathered signatures with appeals for NPR to change its mind.\n\nHow Mr. Edwards described his breakup with NPR depended largely on the day he was asked. At times, he spoke of the bitterness about being shown the door when he felt he was still at the top of his craft. Other times, he joked he was grateful because he no longer had a 6 p.m. bedtime.\n\nRobert Alan Edwards was born in Louisville on May 16, 1947. His father was an accountant and his mother a homemaker. In his 2011 memoir, “A Voice in the Box,” he recounted the Zenith radio from which he could pick up stations as far away as New Orleans.\n\nHe served in the Army during the Vietnam War, producing and anchoring TV and radio news programs for the American Forces Korea Network from Seoul. He found his way to Washington after military service as a news anchor at WTOP while working toward a master’s degree in communications in 1972 from American University. He joined NPR in 1974, four years after its launch.\n\nThe run-up to the debut of “Morning Edition” was far from smooth, he recounted. First, the show needed a name; suggestions included “Earth Rise” and “FYI.” The initial concept for the show was spearheaded by two consultant producers hired by NPR from commercial radio. The consultants brought in their hosts: Mary Tillotson, who went on to work for CNN, and Pete Williams, later an NBC News correspondent.\n\nThe consultants were let go, and NPR tried to remake the show more in its own image, closer to a morning version of “All Things Considered.” Mr. Edwards and co-host Barbara Hoctor were given provisional contracts with the show’s future still in question. (Hoctor spent four months on the show, and then Mr. Edwards became the lone host.) The first broadcast included an interview with actor Martin Sheen about the film “Apocalypse Now.”",

  "text": "Usher stepped out in front of the biggest audience of his life during halftime at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, winning widespread acclaim for his high-energy performance. The platinum-selling R&B artist also found a quieter moment the same day to marry his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Goicoechea. According to the Clark County Clerk’s Office database, the pair applied for a wedding license Thursday and married Sunday.\n\nPeople magazine first reported on the Vegas wedding, citing a representative for the singer.  The ceremony was held at Vegas Weddings just hours after Usher’s halftime performance, the Associated Press reported, and witnesses included Usher’s mother, Jonnetta Patton.\n\nRepresentatives for Usher and the wedding venue didn’t respond immediately to requests for comment Monday.\n\nThe 45-year-old, whose full name is Usher Raymond IV, shares two children with Goicoechea, 40.\n\nIt was a busy week for the resurgent R&B superstar. On Friday, he released his ninth studio album, “Coming Home.”\n\nAt the Super Bowl, he was competing with the star power of Taylor Swift, who came to support the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, watching the game in a luxury box. (The Chiefs scored a game-winning touchdown in overtime to beat the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22)\n\nThe 15-minute halftime show featured a star-studded lineup that included Alicia Keys — who joined Usher in a duet of “My Boo” — plus longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, Will.i.am and H. E.R.\n\nThe Washington Post’s reviewer, Chris Richards, described Usher’s performance as “a blitz of retinal maximalism,” his voice “seemingly made out of elastic, silk, smoke and sunshine.”",

  "text": "Until recently, their only choice would have been a hospital emergency room. But on this cold January night, the paramedics had another option: the D. C. Stabilization Center, a place where people who’ve used drugs or alcohol can safely recover for up to 24 hours under the care of nurses and mentors who have been in their shoes.\n\nThe facility, one of about 60 across the country in cities such as Baltimore, San Francisco, Houston and St. Louis, aims to link patients with treatment — if and when they are ready. If successful, District officials say, the approach will free up overburdened emergency responders and alleviate strain on hospitals still confronting pandemic-era staffing shortages.\n\nYears later, they are betting millions in city funds annually on the center to help meet a still growing need. There were 427 opioid-related fatal overdoses in D. C. last year through October, according to the most recent data available from the chief medical examiner’s office, putting the District on track to outpace a 2022 high of 461 overdoses.\n\nThe location was an early hurdle. They looked back at a year of data to confirm known hot spots in Columbia Heights and east of the Anacostia River, as well as in central D. C. near Union Station and the homeless shelter at Second and D streets NW, one of the largest in the nation. Despite pushback from advocates who argued Wards 7 and 8 needed it more, officials chose 35 K St. NE for its central location and the relative ease of using a building where the city already ran an adult behavioral health clinic.\n\nOfficials say they do not yet have a plan for tracking the long-term progress of patients, knowing they may turn down treatment many times before giving it a try. One person visited at least 17 times in just over three months, Bazron said, adding their 18th visit could be the one that does the trick.\n\nAlert to verbal/tactile stimuli? Check. Blood pressure under 200 mmHg. Check. No signs or trauma or need for sutures. Not combative or violent. No chest pain. A nurse searched his jacket and handed a bottle of Taaka vodka to a security officer, who stashed it in a drawer. His clothes and belongings would be catalogued and locked in a bin for him.\n\nHe told paramedics he wanted to get on the bus. At 86 over 70, his blood pressure was too low for the stabilization center. They took him to George Washington University Hospital, where medics spent about an hour and 45 minutes waiting for a bed for the patient, FEMS officials said later.",

The unanimous vote came after the board blocked a new Advanced Placement high school course on African American studies earlier that year because it “lacks educational value.”\n\nWoodson entered high school late — at 20 — but he graduated in less than two years, according to the NAACP. He received his bachelor’s degree in literature from Berea College in Kentucky, a master’s degree from the University of Chicago and a PhD from Harvard University. He was the second Black American, after Du Bois, to obtain a doctorate from the Ivy League university.\n\nWoodson founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History — now known as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) — in Chicago in 1915. He was inspired by the widespread celebration of Black history and heritage in the city during its commemoration of the 50th anniversary of emancipation, according to the association. The association’s mission was to study the “neglected aspects of Negro life and history,” according to the NAACP.\n\nA year later, Woodson founded the Journal of Negro History — now known as the Journal of African American History. It is the official publication of the ASALH. The journal highlights the achievements of Black Americans and publishes original scholarly articles and book reviews on the African American experience, according to the publication’s website.\n\nWoodson, who worked as a teacher, a principal and the dean of Howard University’s College of Arts and Sciences, is widely regarded as the “father of Black history” for his contributions to African American studies. His commitment to celebrating Black history and heritage culminated in the formation of Negro History Week in 1926, according to the NAACP. The celebration, which Woodson launched during the second week of February, coincided with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.\n\nDu Bois became the first African American to earn a doctoral degree from Harvard in 1895. He taught classics and modern languages for two years at Wilberforce University in Ohio; worked for the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, where he conducted groundbreaking studies on Black Southern households in Virginia, Alabama and Georgia; and taught sociology at Atlanta University, according to History.com.\n\nIn 1910, Du Bois resigned from his teaching position at Atlanta University to become the NAACP’s director of publicity and research. A founding member, he moved to New York, where he edited the organization’s monthly magazine, the Crisis, according to the NAACP. He resigned as editor of the publication in 1934 after a dispute with NAACP leadership; he returned years later. In his new position as director of special research, Du Bois represented the NAACP at the first meeting of the United Nations. He resigned again in 1948.\n\nSome of Du Bois’s most notable works include “The Strivings of the Negro People,” an essay published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1897, and “The Philadelphia Negro,” a groundbreaking 1899 study of the city’s Seventh Ward. In the latter, he concluded that the Black community’s greatest challenges were poverty, crime, lack of education and distrust of those outside the community.\n\nWashington was born into slavery on April 5, 1856. He would go on to rival Du Bois as one of the country’s leading Black intellectuals and become the first African American to be invited to dine at the White House.\n\nWashington, the son of an unknown White man and an enslaved cook named Jane, was enslaved for the first nine years of his life before being freed, according to Tuskegee University. His mother moved the family to Malden, W. Va., where Washington worked as a salt packer, coal miner and houseboy.\n\n“The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing,” Washington said during an 1895 address in Atlanta dubbed the “Atlanta Compromise.”\n\n“No race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized. It is important and right that all privileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercises of these privileges,” he said. “The opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera house.”",

  "text": "One hundred and sixty four people have been killed and another 200 wounded across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The overnight operation in Rafah, a place that has largely been spared the widespread aerial attacks experienced in other parts of the enclave, shocked a bone-tired population that has spent months on the move, trying to outrun the bombs.\n\nPalestinian families are packed into houses and tents in Rafah; some newer arrivals are sleeping in the streets. They are almost entirely dependent on humanitarian relief, as aid groups warn of a looming famine, and disconnected from loved ones in other parts of the Strip because cellular connections are patchy and there is no electricity to charge most phones.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants ambushed Israeli border communities from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage. More than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military campaign, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and much of the Strip has been has been flattened by airstrikes. Israeli authorities say Hamas is holding the bodies of about 30 people who died in captivity or who were killed on Oct. 7.\n\nAfter Biden and Netanyahu spoke Sunday for the first time in more than three weeks, a U. S. administration official said the American position on Rafah had been made “very clear.” The United States would not support such an operation unless Israel has a plan for civilian protection and sustenance “that was actually planned, prepared and implementable,” they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with White House rules.\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said he was “deeply concerned” by the reports from Rafah. “All wars have rules and the laws applicable to armed conflict cannot be interpreted so as to render them hollow or devoid of meaning,” he said in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nPalestinian families who have moved repeatedly say each displacement is harder than the last. Food and water are difficult to carry. Children who have brought their favorite toys with them become inconsolable when they are left behind in the chaos. Communications challenges make it nearly impossible to know what awaits them in other parts of the Strip.\n\nAbove all, there is the question of where to go. A humanitarian worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said his family of five was running out of options. They had fled their home in Khan Younis in early December; now, they were preparing to head back, despite frequent attacks on the city.\n\nHe said they would be joining two dozen other relatives in his family’s one-bedroom house by the sea. The last remaining route connecting southern, central and northern Gaza — known as al-Rasheed or Beach Road — remained open, he said, though for how long he did not know. During earlier forced evacuations, some IDF-designated routes led civilians into the line of fire. Israeli forces have also arrested an unknown number of people at checkpoints along evacuation routes.\n\nBefore the war, Gazans who fit certain criteria could pay several hundred dollars to an Egyptian company to coordinate their exit through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The price has now shot up to $5,000 per adult or more, well out of reach for most families in the impoverished enclave.\n\nEven for the few who can afford it, the process remains opaque and uncertain. On Monday, the Egyptian company Hala posted a notice on its website saying that it was temporarily not accepting new applicants because its wait list was too long.",

  "text": "Mohammed Qadim Abed Hamza held a portrait of his 60-year-old father, Kadhim Abed al-Hamza, killed in the U. S. strikes. The United States, he said, wants to “weaken” Iraqi militias formed to defeat the Islamic State extremist group nearly a decade ago. His father joined at the beginning of that fight, at the urging of Iraq’s highest Shiite religious leader. So did Mohammed, now 29, and three of his brothers.\n\nPressure is building on Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to confront the United States and to accelerate negotiations aimed at winding down the U. S. military presence in Iraq. For the Biden administration, Iraq’s reaction illustrates the challenges of sustaining a security partnership with Baghdad while containing the rapidly spreading fallout from ally Israel’s war in Gaza and fending off attacks from groups aligned with the Iraqi government.\n\nBut the leader of another group targeted in the U. S. strikes, the Tafuf Brigade, which also belongs to the PMF, said men under his command had not participated in attacks against the United States. The leader, Qassim Muslih, told The Washington Post that Washington had made a mistake in striking his group in Akashat.\n\nU. S. officials say Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has less control over militias in Iraq than it did under former chief Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in early 2020. They now believe the IRGC can set parameters for the militias, but under Soleimani’s replacement, Ismail Qaani, they operate more autonomously.\n\nTo the militias, he added, “there is a logic to this violence,” which fell short of declaring war. But the United States didn’t see it that way. If there were unspoken ground rules, he said, the killing of the three Army reservists, all members of a Georgia-based unit, breached them.\n\n“There are some complexities in Iraqi society, which we understand,” the senior U. S. defense official said. “We understand that Prime Minister Sudani, who we consider a partner, has to navigate those complexities,” the official continued. “But that doesn’t really change that obligation” for the Iraqi government to prevent violence against U.S. personnel there.\n\n“We have been obsessing over a divorce between the Iraqi security structure and these militias for a decade,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), said in an interview last week. “My sense is that the Iraqi government has just been willfully reliant on the militias despite our repeated offers to help them become independent.”\n\nIraqi analysts and officials said there is little chance Sudani would confront the militias, given his weak position but also his government’s emphasis on providing Iraqis with stability and economic development. Some of the most powerful militias are also keen to avoid a clash that would threaten their growing political and economic clout.\n\nBefore the latest escalations, he said, Sudani was poised “to achieve something quite important: to choreograph this American withdrawal” — an outcome that also interested the Biden administration, he added. Formal negotiations over the withdrawal of U. S-led coalition troops started in January. The Biden administration has not said what specific outcomes it would like to see from those talks, but Washington is likely to push for a continued military presence of some kind.",

(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)Six times since July, police allege, the same man robbed the same Walgreens in Chinatown, across the street from the Gallery Place Metro station. The FBI joined D. C. police trying to track him down.Residents had long complained of crime and decay in the once-bustling downtown Washington neighborhood of shops and businesses that never seemed to fully recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and they had pressed city officials to take more aggressive steps to clean up the area. Prosecutors began seeking stay-away orders to keep those charged with crimes from coming back, and the city planned an initiative to offer resources for those in the area needing help.Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning.Then on Sunday evening — the day before the city was scheduled to roll out that initiative — police said, 24-year-old Kamanye Williams again robbed the Walgreens at Seventh and H streets Northwest, taking a security guard’s gun and grabbing $4,200 in cash from a backroom.But this time, D.C. police said another security guard shot the suspected robber, now carrying two firearms, sending him to a hospital with critical injuries. The guard, Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said, “did exactly what needed to happen.”The robbery and shooting illustrated the challenge officials have faced in reducing crime in a central commuter hub and a destination for those coming to sporting events and concerts at Capital One Arena, a few blocks from the Walgreens.Violent crime increased 12 percent last year in Chinatown, which saw 52 robberies, compared with 40 in 2022, according to police statistics for the patrol area that covers the neighborhood. Robberies, though, have gone down significantly so far this year. Through early February of this year, there had been just three, compared with 12 during the same time period in 2022.On Monday, officials vowed to make more improvements so people feel safer. The police chief joined Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) to announce the opening of a new office a few doors from the Walgreens where police officers and health and other officials will offer services to residents, including help with substance abuse and mental health problems.The Chinatown-Gallery Place area — where high-rise apartment buildings and hotels sit alongside major tourist attractions such as the National Portrait Gallery and government buildings including the FBI headquarters — is roughly sandwiched between Mount Vernon Square and Pennsylvania Avenue. It includes more than 1,100 businesses employing 28,600 workers, according to city planning documents, and permanent residents number about 3,800.The troubles in Chinatown have built since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered offices across the city. Streets are pockmarked with vacant storefronts that used to be restaurants and retailers, and residents have complained that the area around the Metro station, devoid of the ebb and flow of office workers, is particularly desolate, though Metro’s general manager said Monday that ridership is “going up.” Last week, the system saw its highest 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. hour since the pandemic.At a community meeting in August, residents and executives for Monumental Sports & Entertainment — which owns the Capital One Arena and its two principal tenants, the Washington Capitals and Wizards — complained of drug dealing, loitering and assaults. Some people told police they had seen drug deals under the signature Friendship Arch, and they described pushing through the illicit activity to get into the Metro station. Police made arrests, they said, but they would soon see the same offenders back in the area hours later.Police stepped up patrols with officers on foot and bicycles, and federal prosecutors said they started charging more misdemeanor crimes and seeking court-issued stay-away orders for people they arrested at or near the Metro station, hoping to keep them from returning to the area. Asked if that initiative is working, Smith said she has been in close contact with the U.S. attorney’s office but did not directly answer the question. “When we have asked for stay-away orders, they have been granted,” the police chief said.In December, the owner of the two sports franchises announced plans to move the teams to a new arena in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood as soon as 2028.Bowser is pushing Monumental to reconsider and to accept the District’s $500 million offer for upgrades. She said Monday’s announcement of the city’s first “Safe Commercial Corridor Hub” in Chinatown was one way of addressing the wide range of issues that can affect public safety, without relying exclusively on police. Monica Dixon, president of external affairs at Monumental, said the initiative “will make a big difference here, and we’re excited about it.” But when asked if Monumental was still considering Bowser’s offer, Dixon said the company was focused “100 percent” on Virginia.D.C. officials said other hubs are planned this spring along the U Street entertainment area and in Anacostia.The mayor said crime in Chinatown and across the city is down, but noted, “We have to work urgently to keep that up. We not only want people to be safe, but feel safe.”Smith said the new office will ensure officers out on foot and on bicycles reach emergencies faster, and will make crisis counselors from the city departments of behavioral health and human services more accessible to people abusing drugs, experiencing homelessness or suffering mental breakdowns. Authorities said the office could also help free officers to concentrate on more serious criminal matters.“This isn’t just about crime,” Smith said. “It’s about making sure we can quickly get services to people who are suffering.”Before Sunday’s shooting, Smith said detectives and the FBI had been investigating armed robberies at the Walgreens, focusing on one man and possibly some accomplices. The robberies began in July and continued at pace of roughly one a month into the winter, authorities said.Smith said investigators “were closing in on this suspect” when he “came back again” on Sunday.About 6:30 p.m., police alleged, Williams, armed with a gun, walked into the Walgreens and forced a guard and an employee into a backroom. Police said he took away the guard’s gun, and stole money.A second security guard then entered the backroom and shot Williams. A police report says authorities recovered $4,265, a black handgun belonging to the alleged robber and a Glock handgun that belonged to the guard.Armed guards, called special police officers, are licensed by the District. D.C. police said their criminal investigation division and internal affairs are investigating the shooting. The guard who fired his weapons works for a private security company contracted by Walgreens. A representative of Walgreens did not respond to an interview request on Monday.Smith said additional arrests are possible in the case. She said the suspect was being charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, armed robbery, assault on a police officer and carrying an unlicensed firearm in connection with Sunday’s incident. The chief said he faces six other charges in connection with the previous holdups of the Walgreens.A police department spokesman, Tom Lynch, said the first robbery at the Walgreens that authorities attributed to Williams occurred July 18. The spokesman said one additional robbery occurred each month in 2023, except for October. Lynch said in each instance, a gunman forced an employee into a backroom. He said most occurred between 7:30 p.m. and 10 p.m.Police said Williams remained hospitalized on Monday and he has not yet made an initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court. It could not be determined if he has an attorney.A woman who answered a phone at an address linked to Williams identified herself as his grandmother, but declined to provide her name. She said she had not heard of the accusations against Williams. “I don’t have the full story, so I don’t want to comment,” she said.Caps put it all together to blank the Bruins and end a six-game slideWizards keep up the fight but stumble to their sixth straight lossUnforced error costs the Capitals in overtime loss to NHL-best CanucksSign in or create a free account to save your preferences",

(Mark Hunter/Elena Velez)Every generation of fashion designers has a problematic favorite — someone whose politics, taste or point of view run against the status quo. Elena Velez, 29, is her generation’s enfant terrible. Puerto Rican and raised in Wisconsin, she came on the scene in 2018 with a ragged and romantic picture of femininity, and techniques that reflect an obsession with the bygone craftsmanship and industrial decay of the Rust Belt.Velez has a chip on her shoulder. She has vocally chastised the fashion world for its lack of financial and critical support (she has told the New York Times that her mother cashed out her retirement fund to help pay for her label), although these are unfortunately issues that any young designer with their own brand faces.And she has aligned herself with the unsavory flavor of a tendentious downtown New York crowd, whose podcasters, media personalities and fashion- and art-adjacent figures rose to prominence under the aegis of “Dimes Square” — the over-explained neighborhood in Lower Manhattan known for its reactionary politics and associations with Peter Thiel. (Louis Pisano, a Paris-based American influencer, posted on X last year that Velez is “the donald trump of emerging designers.”)She is particularly friendly with Anna Khachiyan and actress Dasha Nekrasova, the hosts of the podcast “Red Scare,” which began with a “Bernie is daddy” dirtbag left mind-set, but has since devolved into a hipster J.D. Vance for women who are good at taking selfies in their underwear. The Dimes Square perspective was so overcooked during the peak of the pandemic — earning think pieces in nearly every newspaper and magazine — that it is already dated, especially as the presidential election snaps into gear.Skip to end of carouselStyle is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here.After a mud-wrestling exhibition last year, she mounted a more pointedly hostile show on Sunday night: a salon themed around the film and book “Gone With the Wind” — the controversial story of Southern belle Scarlett O’Hara and the decline of her plantation, Tara, and the South during the Civil War — in an Upper East Side mansion, with a symposium hosted by Khachiyan and podcaster Jack Mason on the work’s supposedly misunderstood genius.For the first hour, cigarette smoke filled the creaky mansion as attendees in a “rustic Americana black tie” dress code wandered around a table with a sprawl of pomegranate chunks, stacks of cheeses, heaps of meat and platters of oysters topped with edible silver. The dare of focusing on the novel and film — which have been debated since their releases in the 1930s for their racist stereotypes, and framed with trigger warnings since 2020 — hung over the evening, giving it a nefarious, rather than nostalgic, mood. Ten women were dressed in looks Velez called “couture,” their hair mounted in Marie Antoinette-like piles, and they wandered in and out of the various rooms.The setting, especially the number of similarly attired women and the unexpected ratio of men, was more “Eyes Wide Shut” than Tara when it sizzles. “I want to go to Minnesota or Michigan and do new Rockwell s---,” I overheard a man say during the cocktail hour. “Photograph tobacco and fields.” Another guest lamented that she was being told that her film was too problematic to get a distribution deal. A man in a suit mentioned the food with trepidation. “I’m kind of afraid that everything here is poison.”After an hour, Velez, in a minidress and over-the-knee boots, her own hair stacked high and festooned with flowers, welcomed the group “for the first of a new series of salons dedicated to bringing fashion into the foreground of thoughtful, modern discourse.” She drew comparisons between herself and O’Hara: “Her grit, intrepidness and recalcitrance lead her toward dream or disaster.”Then everyone went upstairs. Mason and Khachiyan spoke in their signature shocks of droll pseudo-evil; Khachiyan complained about her tight wig and corset. “I can’t breathe,” she said flatly, and an awful pause hung in the air as the audience tried to decide whether she was making a disturbing joke about George Floyd. “Say her name!” an audience member chortled.Khachiyan then read aloud a printout she called a “monologue,” comparing O’Hara to a modern-day e-girl, Madonna and Kim Kardashian in a voice like a hung-over boarding-school student, stoic but self-satisfied.Mason spoke about how “Gone With the Wind,” published in 1936, presages books about women who gain power through sex and shopping, such as Judith Krantz’s “Scruples,” from 1978 — ignoring Edith Wharton’s much more influential “The Custom of the Country,” from 1913. “Gone With the Wind” makes the case for big and sweeping romance “against the miserable gray aesthetics of today,” Mason said.The specter of the work’s bad reputation, especially its treatment of race, clung to the talk like a bad handbag, mostly by the hosts’ design. Khachiyan referred repeatedly to “the topic we’re not allowed to touch on” — race — though she mentioned that the actress who played Mammy — “I think her name was Hattie McDaniel” — was the first Black person to win an Academy Award. “Less important is all the racist controversy,” she said. “More important is that people think it’s a piece of pulp.” When an audience member pressed Mason and Khachiyan to address “the topic we’re not allowed to touch on,” Khachiyan refused, saying, “I’m a libtard.”Equally as odd was the unoriginality of the argument that O’Hara is a feminist icon — a position so committed to trolling that its instigators failed to realize they were simply arguing for Mitchell’s original intention. The book and film paint O’Hara as a pillar of strength, and in many parts of the South, she’s still thought of as such. (She’s a popular inspiration for attendees of Southern sorority balls.) This is one of the best-selling books of the 20th century — not exactly a suppressed work. It has not been a part of the current wave of book banning, which has mostly focused on LGBTQ+ literature and books by non-White authors. HBO temporarily removed the film from streaming in 2020, but then restored it with trigger warnings, and last year, the book’s publishers rereleased it with similar warnings about its racist content. In other words, it remains accessible.And it has long been trendy in pop intellectualism to reframe the villain as the hero — a framework in works such as the musical (and forthcoming film) “Wicked” and “Breaking Bad.” Giving intellectual heft to flaky subjects has been a familiar if smooth trick for roughly two decades, since media outlets like Gawker and n+1 were founded.Sharp.

They tell the story Velez wants to tell, but better: The femme flourishes of Khachiyan’s gown were disturbed by its muddy color; a secretly not-simple button-up frock looked like an expert sewer used the saddest, plainest, last-resort material for a desperately needed dress.“Each look is both an insistence on glamour in the face of apocalypse and a repossession of a time in women’s history when the sharpest weapon in her artillery was a red dress,” Velez said. Interesting! If the fashion powers that be ignore or don’t care about her misplaced edgelord act, you could imagine one of her pieces would make a great look for the Met Gala.Fashion is a powerful medium because it isn’t didactic. Clothes are ambiguous, easy to co-opt and reframe: One designer’s classic jeans and T-shirt is another designer’s disruptive statement on the horrors of conformity. A fashion show does not need to be obvious or unmistakable in its messaging, and it is usually at its worst when it is. (Just think: Nothing is more boring now than a T-shirt with a slogan on it.)John Galliano, who just showed a ravenously received couture collection at Maison Margiela more than a decade after a drug-fueled antisemitic tirade derailed his career at Dior, is a useful example here. His show was all about the underworld of outcasts and despicable people, but there was no clear sense that Galliano was referring to himself. You could still read him there, though, which is what made it thoughtful instead of a snooze.You can say what you mean and feel and think is wrong with the world through cloth, stitches, staging, music and mood — that’s what a great designer does. Velez is clearly capable of that, but also seems obsessed with promoting this dated worldview to the point of self-destruction. It was — to quote Chester Cheetah, another cartoonish antihero who pushes junk — dangerously cheesy.Is anything still cool in fashion?Is anything still cool in fashion?",

  "text": "The dual pushback led executives with Monumental Sports & Entertainment — billionaire Ted Leonsis’s company that owns the teams — to hastily convene a briefing with reporters Monday afternoon to assert that the plan to move to a new megacomplex in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard was fully on track. Still, the tension emanating from both sides underscored how the foundation for the teams’ move is far from solid, with support in the Virginia legislature uncertain. Meanwhile, Bowser alluded to the possibility of legal action in D. C. to enforce the teams’ existing lease at Capital One Arena downtown.\n\n“The Governor is confident at the end of the day that the General Assembly will come together because this project is good for the entire Commonwealth,” Youngkin spokesman Rob Damschen said in an email to The Post. “It creates 30,000 jobs and unlocks billions in new revenue that can be used to fund expanded toll relief in Portsmouth, increased funding for I-81, and new money for education for rural and urban school districts across the Commonwealth.”\n\nBowser’s comments came on the heels of an op-ed she published in The Post on Friday evening in which she reminded Leonsis that the District’s $500 million offer to fund upgrades at the arena remained on the table. Bowser also wrote that if Leonsis were to accept, not only could money be made available within a few months after approval from the D. C. Council, but also, “our deal would mean Monumental can avoid any broken promises, breached leases or potential litigation to distract from building the most valuable regional sports company.”\n\nThe op-ed drew pushback over the weekend from Monumental, which said on X that the company did not intend to break the terms of its lease. The lease at Capital One goes through 2047. But under an amendment to the lease, the company has the option to end it earlier, by 2027, if the bonds that were used to fund upgrades at the arena in 2007 are paid off in full.\n\nShe has shot down the idea to bring the Mystics to Capital One before the team’s lease at Entertainment and Sports Arena in Congress Heights ends in 2037. Leonsis and Monumental have since clarified that they will not breach the lease at ESA — which opened in 2018 — and the Mystics will play there through 2037, unless the mayor agrees to bring them to Capital One.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nThe best Broadway love songs about the love you feel right nowA musical-theater playlist that will help you make sense of your feelingsThere’s a special connection between love and musicals, starting with the trope of the “conditional love song.” It’s the one early in the show when characters envision the prospect of love (“If I Loved You” from “Carousel,” “I’ll Know” from “Guys and Dolls”), often asserting their wrongness for each other in a way that shows they’re completely right. That sets up the declarations that come later, after a prejudice, social convention, personality clash or other divide is overcome. There are classic show tunes that express love of children (“Sunrise, Sunset”), places (“Oklahoma!”), theater itself (“What I Did for Love”). “As If We Never Said Goodbye” from “Sunset Boulevard” is a love song about an actress returning to where she once made movies; “One Last Time” from “Hamilton” is a breakup song between George Washington and his country.With these many meanings in mind, several Post contributors consider the love show tunes that have stuck with them (avoiding the expected standards like “Somewhere” and “Till There Was You”), with the hope that one or more might speak to you in this moment.The love for someone who is out of your league but you’re shooting your shot: ‘You’re Sensational’ from ‘High Society’An ink-stained tabloid reporter is bowled over by a society goddess, and he just goes for it, beginning with an artful neg. “I’ve no proof / if people say you’re more or less aloof.” But before she can bristle, he’s putting it all on the table: “You’re sensational … that’s all.” Cole Porter got lazy with the lyrics midway through (“If some day you’ll let me come to call / we’ll have a ball”?), and maybe that’s why it so rarely gets covered. Or perhaps it’s because only Frank Sinatra in the original film version (later adapted for the stage) could have pulled off this song’s potent blend of romantic praise, sexual gamesmanship and blunt come-on. —Amy ArgetsingerThe budding love so good you think it could be online-dating fraud: ‘Make Believe’ from ‘Show Boat’Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II didn’t know they were writing for the internet age. After all, this number from the seminal 1927 musical is initially sung by heroine Magnolia and the gambler Gaylord Ravenal when they tumble into love at first sight in the 1880s. Expressing the joy of romantic connection, the song also hints — with its let’s-pretend phrasing and roller-coaster vocal lines — that the relationship is precarious. How apt the lyrics are for the era of online anonymity and cyber-courtship. “The cold and brutal fact is / you and I have never met,” Magnolia sings. At least she couldn’t immediately Venmo him any money. —Celia WrenThe love so enticing it makes you lie: ‘If I Could Tell Her’ from ‘Dear Evan Hansen’By the time this Plain White T’s-inspired song arrives late in Act 1, the titular teen’s well-meaning lie — that he was friends with classmate Connor Murphy before the loner took his own life — is already spiraling. But Evan ramps up the velocity when he professes his love for Connor’s sister, Zoe, by proxy — telling his crush every quirk he adores about her by putting his own words in her late brother’s mouth. It’s a testament to Benj Pasek and Justin Paul’s songwriting dexterity that this guitar-plucking duet plays not as devious but sweetly sincere. By gracefully expressing Evan’s longing for Zoe and unpacking her fractured relationship with Connor, the torch song fuses these characters’ parallel quests for connection. —Thomas FloydThat ‘wait, we’re more than friends’ love: ‘Suddenly, Seymour’ from ‘Little Shop of Horrors’Ellen Greene delivered one of the all-time great vocal performances in the original version, flipping from a lilt to a tweet to a belt to a full-throated scream. Her character and plant shop owner Seymour are backed up by Ronnette, Chiffon and Crystal, characters named after three of the great girl groups of the 1960s. Like many songs by those groups, this one by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman conceals a darkness behind its boppability: It’s a love song about breaking cycles of abuse and trauma. But unlike a girl group song, this time the good guy wins out over the bad boy. —Shane O’NeillThe love you know will be hard but you still surrender: ‘I’ll Cover You’ from ‘Rent’Just as the HIV-positive Bohemians Collins and Angel realize they’re in it for the long haul, their duet by Jonathan Larson professes that while “you can’t buy love” at least “you can rent it.” In other words, love ain’t free, which is the realest take there is. Sure, “cover” speaks to the warm protection a lover provides, but I like the flip side just as much. When you cover emotional costs, you take on responsibility, and your partner should chip in, too. That’s love. That take becomes even more urgent for Collins and Angel seeing as how the NYU professor and the drag street performer are both brokety broke broke. When your heart sends a bill, the check is due. Pay up in “a thousand sweet kisses.” —Helena Andrews-DyerThe love for your life’s calling: ‘Me and the Sky’ from ‘Come From Away’It’s not often a lyric includes an ode to a company’s paint scheme. “American Airlines had the prettiest planes,” croons Beverley Bass, the real-life pilot of one of 38 planes that diverted to a tiny Newfoundland town on Sept. 11, 2001. This song by Irene Sankoff and David Hein weaves in other aviation-geek details as it tells the story of Bass’s career and lifetime love of flying, as well as the forces that worked against her. It is a true journey: soaring, triumphant and ultimately devastating. —Hannah SampsonThe love so intense it takes on mythic proportions: ‘If Ever I Would Leave You’ from ‘Camelot’The song opens the second act of the 1960 Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe musical: The handsomest knight, Lancelot, has captured the heart of the queen, Guinevere, and he sings about being bewitched by her all year long. The lyrics are a bit greeting-card icky (“Your face with a luster / that puts gold to shame”? Please.) It’s the melody that works on me in every season, a swooning, symphonic shorthand for moony-eyed constancy and passionate commitment. –Peter MarksThe love of the noncommittal: ‘Marry Me a Little’ from ‘Company’What better love song to embrace this age of pop-up polyamory than this one from Stephen Sondheim’s treat-filled treatise on single life? A noncommittal wish from birthday bachelor Robert as he struggles to blow out his candles, the number was originally cut, later made the centerpiece and title of a 1981 off-Broadway revue and restored in the ’90s to its proper place at the end of Act I. There have been many great performances of “Marry Me”: Neil Patrick Harris, Raúl Esparza, Adrian Lester and Suzanne Henry in that revue, a forerunner of the recent Broadway gender-swapping revival. She sings with just enough endearingly overblown confidence that you almost believe for a moment that keeping your options open makes perfect sense: “Want me more than others — not exclusively / that’s the way it ought to be.” –Michael BrodeurThe love you’re not sure exists: ‘Do You Love Me?’ from ‘Fiddler on the Roof’When relationships harden into units — negotiating survival and children and stress — interrogating the basics feels threatening. In this song by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock, Tevye, the inquisitive protagonist of “Fiddler on the Roof” whose daughters keep rebelliously marrying for love, asks his wife Golde (whom he met on their wedding day) if she loves him. The song is unlovely and jagged, the melody’s sweetness repeatedly punctured by the squawks of their habitual bickering. Golde — overworked, efficient, snapping occasionally under the strain of supplying the structure of family life against which the rest of the family rebels — has never been asked what she thinks. Or feels. Her surprise when she lets herself finally hear the question is unspeakably moving. –Lili LoofbourowThe self-love that feels elusive: ‘She Used to Be Mine’ from ‘Waitress’Jenna bakes her feelings into bittersweet confections like “I Hate My Husband Pie” and “Pregnant, Miserable, Self-Pitying Loser Pie.” She’s lost herself in an abusive marriage, and when she performs this poignant ballad penned by Sara Bareilles, it’s relatable to women of so many circumstances that it could be our national anthem. Singing to her unborn child as well as to herself, Jenna laments: “It’s not what I asked for / sometimes life just slips in through a back door / and carves out a person and makes you believe it’s all true / and now I’ve got you.” Which sounds tragic, but there’s hope in her self-awareness, agency in her imperfections and comfort in this one timeless truth about love: When all else fails, there’s pie. —Janice PageThat love where they’re just not that into you, and that’s (maybe) okay: ‘By the Sea’ from ‘Sweeney Todd’We’ve all pined for someone who’s a lost cause. Hopefully, your crush wasn’t also a murderous barber and you his accomplice in baking people into pies. But a quiet life by the sea does sound nice, doesn’t it? Of all the hopeless romantics Stephen Sondheim set to song, Mrs. Lovett is by far the most deranged yet somehow the most endearing. Her attempt to seduce a stone-faced Sweeney with a sweet and wistful melody is doubly delusional, assuming he could reciprocate and that they could escape a dismal fate after everything they’ve done. Poor things. —Naveen KumarThe love you try to find in all the wrong ways: ‘The Love of My Life’ from ‘Brigadoon’Like other musicals of the mid-20th century, Lerner and Loewe’s “Brigadoon” features both a straightforward, earnestly romantic love story and a zany B-plot involving less virtuous, more mischief-prone characters. (See: “Guys and Dolls,” “Kiss Me, Kate,” “Oklahoma!”) In Brigadoon, a magical Scottish highland town that only materializes for one day every 100 years, the resident less-virtuous lady is the boisterous Meg Brockie, notorious for both her eagerness to become a wife and her habit of consummating every potential marriage very prematurely. But here, as Meg recounts all her romantic misadventures to the latest apple of her eye, she exhibits a plucky optimism toward finding love that I find refreshing and, dare I say it, wholesome. —Ashley Fetters MaloyWhat kind of love was that, exactly?: ‘Frank Mills’ from ‘Hair’The 1968 original cast album of “Hair” came my way too late and too soon: It was 1980 and I was 12, drawn to its forbidden fruit of sex, drugs and angry politics. But, late in Act 1, actress Shelley Plimpton sings a sad, short ballad (by Galt MacDermot, Gerome Ragni and James Rado) about lost love: “I met a boy called Frank Mills, on September 12th right here in front of the Waverly, but unfortunately, I lost his address.” It’s about a girl looking for a misfit boy she’ll never see again. What felt like a million years later, Gen X heartthrob Evan Dando (of the Lemonheads) rerecorded “Frank Mills” in 1992, without changing the pronouns, and the song acquired a new layer of longing: a man looking for a man. Still lost, but for me, right then, completely found. —Hank StueverThe love of a friend you won’t see much any more: ‘For Good’ from ‘Wicked’A significant friendship is coming to a close. You can feel it. Maybe one of you is moving. Maybe an irreconcilable difference has emerged. This Stephen Schwartz song — sung at a point of no return for Glinda and Elphaba, who will develop opposing brands as Good and Wicked Witches, respectively — takes the “grow” part of “growing apart” seriously. It has it all. Grief. Gratitude. Acknowledgments of how much they’ve become a part of each other. Slightly passive-aggressive apologies (“I ask forgiveness for the things I’ve done I know you blame me for”). Then there’s that chorus: “Because I knew you I have been changed for good.” That “knew” instead of “know” breaks my heart, every time. —Lili LoofbourowThe love that spans too many boundaries: ‘Underwater’ from ‘Caroline, or Change’Tony Kushner’s story, set in 1960s Louisiana, centers on Noah, a precocious 8-year-old Jewish boy, and the person he idolizes: Caroline, his family’s stern maid, a Black woman whose Christian God is very Old Testament. The two characters are separated by so much — race, class, religion, generation — and the musical hums with the jocular tension between them, until it reaches a hate-fueled crescendo in Act 2. “Underwater,” by Kusher and Jeanine Tesori, is the metaphysical truce that follows. It runs just over two minutes, contains fewer than 150 words, and doesn’t offer easy reconciliation. But it reconnects Noah and Caroline through their shared condition of sorrow: Noah’s grief over the death of his mother, Caroline’s bitterness over her station in life, in a world changing too fast. Love often springs from joy and abandon, but sometimes it’s rooted in a darker place, which makes its flowering even more beautiful. —Dan ZakThe love that seems doomed but you carry on anyway: ‘Promises’ from ‘Hadestown’Anaïs Mitchell’s retelling of a Greek myth delivers a love song so far distant from the typical brassy belts and creamy ballads. Orpheus and Eurydice have reconnected after a meet-cute, a rainstorm, a deal with the devil and an insurrection from the damned. Their trials teach them that lasting love is not defined by sweet words, but the willingness to walk with your partner through their hell. The efforts aren’t exactly successful — it is a tragedy, after all — but nonetheless the song depicts something real and resonant for any relationship. —Robert SamuelsThat ride-or-die platonic love: ‘I Will Never Leave You’ from ‘Side Show’Daisy and Violet do everything together, including rise to fame on the vaudeville circuit. Even as Violet is set to marry, the sisters have no choice but to stick together — they’re conjoined twins. The 1997 oddity by Bill Russell and Henry Krieger has proved a two-time Broadway flop, but this duet is a soaring tribute to the kind of love that can withstand any strength test. Daisy and Violet may be bound by necessity, but their devotion to each other reverberates with fierce sincerity. Original stars Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley received a rare shared Tony nomination, and their performance at the ceremony is a classic. —Naveen KumarThe love that emboldens someone else to love: ‘More I Cannot Wish You’ from ‘Guys and Dolls’After Sarah Brown falls in love with a gangster and confesses her regret to her uncle, a fellow missionary, he encourages her to overcome her misgivings, singing that there’s nothing he wants more than for her to find “your own true love, this day.” Yes, “velvet” and “mansions” would be nice, but if you find happiness with a man who lives life dice roll to dice roll, savor it. It’s a clear-eyed principle that affirms his own love for a daughter figure, and is informed by a lifetime of wisdom and a spirit of tolerance. —Zachary Pincus-RothThe love of life: ‘My Favorite Things’ from ‘The Sound of Music’Is this a love song? Unequivocally, it’s a lullaby about loving stuff, but in a broader sense it’s a little prayer designed to remind us of the abundant good that still exists in this hard world. Sung to console some children through the distress of a thunderstorm, that Richard Rodgers melody does artful somersaults between major and minor keys. And those roses, those mittens, those snowflakes — Oscar Hammerstein knew what he was doing. These things are delicate, fleeting. But if our love for them is strong, it can protect us from the oblivion of our fears. —Chris RichardsThe best Broadway love songs about the love you feel right nowThe best Broadway love songs about the love you feel right now",

  "text": "And couples named Taylor and Travis? Travis and Taylor? Tayvis, if you will (or the less-successful Traylor)? The Tays and Travs who have already found love with each other? What’s this been like for them?\n\nThe 30-year-old has loved Swift’s music since high school, and she’s dressed up as the other Taylor for Halloween five times. When she married a Travis in 2022, she had no idea it would one day give her another connection to the singer.\n\n“I’ve been to a ton of shows in my life, and that one, just like the energy from the fans and how into it her fan base was … it was impressive, I can’t lie,” Travis, 31, said.\n\nThe Kings, who met on Hinge six years ago and are expecting their first child in July, are also avid football fans. Disappointed by the Baltimore Ravens’ loss to Kelce’s Chiefs, Travis supported the 49ers in the Super Bowl. His wife admitted she didn’t really care who won but wanted to see Swift.\n\nTravis Reichenbach asked Taylor Adams to marry him on Sept. 22, at the summit of Mount LeConte in Tennessee. Two days later, Swift showed up to her first Chiefs game, effectively announcing to the world that she was seeing Kelce.\n\nAdams, 27, doesn’t identify as a Swiftie, but the couples’ similarities have left her hoping the stars’ relationship works out: “I am definitely rooting for them, just because of our names,” she said. “And … they started dating right when we got engaged, so it would be kind of cool if they stay together.”\n\nThough the couple admits to occasionally finding Swift’s presence annoying during the NFL season, they said that complaints about her being shown during the games are overblown and that they have enjoyed watching it bring more people to football. They weren’t surprised at the attention the stars’ relationship garnered.\n\n“Travis Kelce has always been pretty personable and a character that people like in the NFL, and then, it’s Taylor Swift, so,” Reichenbach said. “The fact that they’re together is kind of interesting — that two people at the top of their respective careers are together.”\n\nTaylor Johnson, a 30-year-old occupational therapist, has contended with comments about her first name “ever since I can remember, ever since Taylor Swift became famous.” In recent weeks, the reactions to the couple’s names have been funny, she said.\n\nAn elderly acquaintance “called us ‘the original TNT’ the other day … and I was like, how do you know what this is?” she said. But then “I was telling one of my patients about this, and they had absolutely no clue what I was talking about.”",

  "text": "Franklin’s isolated seat at the dinner table in “A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving” riled viewers of the classic that aired 50 years ago. But a new TV special coming out this month about the first Black “Peanuts” character literally gives him a better seat at the table.“Snoopy Presents: Welcome Home, Franklin,” premiering Feb. 16 on Apple TV Plus, will focus on Franklin’s origin story. The trailer, released Friday, shows that after moving to a new neighborhood, Franklin Armstrong initially struggles to fit in, with kids passing him by as he tries to strike up conversations. He vows to make new friends and win the town’s Soap Box Derby race with his partner, Charlie Brown.\n\nIn a lighthearted part of the trailer, Charlie asks Franklin about his music taste, to which Franklin gushes about James Brown: “You’re not related, are you?” Franklin asks, comparing James Brown’s face to Charlie’s.\n\nThe special was co-written by Robb Armstrong — the “JumpStart” creator who inspired Franklin’s surname — along with Charles M. Schulz’s son and grandson — Craig and Bryan Schulz, respectively — and “The Peanuts Movie” executive producer Cornelius Uliano.\n\nWith the “Peanuts” characters animated once again, one particular moment of the special’s trailer struck a chord with fans of the comic strip. Franklin is again settled in a controversially placed chair — but this time, he’s given an upgrade.\n\n“Hey Franklin! We saved you a seat over here!” Linus says, referring to an empty seat between him and Charlie Brown on the opposite side of the table.\n\nSome viewers of “A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving” criticized Franklin’s spot in its dinner scene in recent years, posting on social media that it was unfair for the character to sit alone on a long side of the table in a lawn chair while his White friends sat together on the other sides of the table in sturdier chairs.\n\nRobin Reed, who voiced Franklin in the 1973 animation, told MSNBC in 2021 that despite his character’s seat position drumming up controversy more recently, that wasn’t the focus when it was first aired.\n\n“It’s so very easy to get offended or upset,” he said. “But we have to remember that at that time, that actually represented progress.”\n\nMany who commented on the Franklin special’s trailer said they considered the reimagined version to be a win, especially during Black History Month. Fans applauded Franklin’s new chair on social media, noting how the move symbolically honored the character that effectively integrated “Peanuts” in an era where racial segregation was still commonplace.\n\nFranklin was introduced into the “Peanuts” comic universe in 1968, after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spurred retired teacher Harriet Glickman to ask Charles Schulz and other prominent comic artists to racially integrate their work.\n\nSchulz initially told Glickman in a letter he was hesitant because he didn’t want to come off as patronizing to Black people. But after support from Glickman’s friends, who were Black parents, and after Schulz stood his ground when questioned by the syndicate, Franklin was printed in papers. In his first appearance, which is also re-created in the “Welcome Home, Franklin” trailer, he hands Charlie Brown’s beach ball back to him.",

  "text": "Last week in the United States, a rare case of human plague was confirmed in rural Oregon, according to Deschutes County Health Services. The unnamed individual is likely to have been infected by a pet cat, which had symptoms, health officials said. The case was identified and treated early, “posing little risk to the community,” and no additional cases have emerged.\n\nIn recent decades, an average of seven human plague cases are reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bubonic plague is the most common form of the plague and is characterized by painful, swollen lymph nodes known as “buboes.” While not totally eradicated, “human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare,” according to the World Health Organization.\n\n“It’s a popular misconception that it’s an ‘old’ medieval disease,” Steve Atkinson, associate professor of molecular and cellular bacteriology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, told The Washington Post by email Tuesday. “In reality it’s still around and is endemic in rodent populations in many parts of the world including the USA, parts of South America, Africa, Asia.”\n\n“One key hotspot is Madagascar,” Atkinson said, adding that the island nation had a prolonged epidemic in 2017 for three months starting in August, with 2,417 confirmed cases and 209 fatalities. “There are still cases every year throughout the world,” he added.\n\nHumans who contract the disease have usually been bitten by a flea that is infected by the bacteria. Another way is from “direct contact with infected tissues or fluids while handling an animal that is sick with or that has died from plague,” according to the CDC. The bacteria can also be picked up by inhaling respiratory droplets after close contact with cats or humans with pneumonic plague — the “most serious form of the disease,” according to the CDC, and the only way plague can spread from person to person.\n\nBetween 1900 and 2012, there were 1,006 confirmed or probable human plague cases in the United States, according to the CDC. Bubonic plague accounts for over 80 percent of U. S. plague cases. Since the 1990s, plague cases have mostly occurred in Africa, according to the WHO. “The three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Peru,” it says.\n\n“Plague has killed millions of people and is often considered a disease of the past. But plague is far from being eradicated,” said Sophie Jullien, a pediatrician who has worked with the WHO to develop a manual for plague surveillance and prevention. “The main reasons are because the bacteria causing plague live and survive in the ground and in animal reservoirs. … They can survive under the ground for years.”\n\nPeople with the bubonic plague normally develop a fever, headache, chills and have swollen, painful lymph nodes. The “classic buboes” are neck and groin swellings, Atkinson said, and are “popularly depicted in almost every medieval painting of the disease.” The bacteria multiply in a lymph node near to where the bacteria entered the human body following a flea bite and can spread in the bloodstream if untreated.\n\nSymptoms of the plague usually begin in humans two to eight days after exposure to an infected animal or flea, according to the Deschutes County Health Services: “If not diagnosed early, bubonic plague can progress to septicemic plague (bloodstream infection) and/or pneumonic plague (lung infection). These forms of plague are more severe and difficult to treat.”\n\nUsually, patients will have blood and other samples, such as sputum or pus, taken from a bubo. If the plague is identified, then antibiotics are administered as the usual treatment and the patient may be medically isolated. “Early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives,” according to the WHO.\n\nThere is no commonly available vaccine for the plague. Although improved sanitation, better living conditions and health care have helped temper the disease, Atkinson said, “the disease itself is just the same as the one that swept through Europe during the Black Death outbreak.”\n\nThe Deschutes County Health Services and WHO suggest some best practices to avoid the plague — primarily by avoiding all contact with rodents and their fleas. “Pet cats are highly susceptible to plague,” according to the Deschutes County Health Services. “If possible, discourage their hunting of rodents,” it advises. Treating pets with flea control products can also help — as well as avoiding feeding squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents in campgrounds and picnic areas, and applying insect repellents.",

  "text": "JERUSALEM — The historic Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza’s oldest active church, was struck Thursday by Israel as it sheltered hundreds of Palestinians displaced by the war, according to religious officials. Maher Ayyad, 72, a member of the community, said the strike hit a two-story building in the church compound, killing 18 people and injuring at least 20. About 100 people were in the bombed building at the time of the strike, he said, and about 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.\n\nAmash tweeted Friday afternoon that several relatives who had been sheltering in the church, including two women he identified as Viola and Yara, were killed in the strike.\n\nThere are about 1,000 Palestinian Christians remaining in Gaza, and the loss was “huge” for the community, Ayyad said. About 500 Christians, including Ayyad, have relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.\n\nThe Washington Post geolocated the strike and confirmed the location of the church based on a video that shows people searching through rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem blamed Israel for the strike.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in an emailed statement that a strike targeting a Hamas control center “damaged the wall of a church in the area” and that it was “aware of reports on casualties” and was reviewing the incident. They declined to provide further information and reiterated, “It is important to clarify that the Church was not the target of the strike.”\n\nAyyad is also a medical director at al-Ahli Hospital, where a blast Tuesday killed 471 people and injured more than 300, according to Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has disputed that death toll.\n\nThe Order of St. George, an associated order of the church, issued a statement confirming Thursday’s strike. “Archbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don’t know if he is injured,” the Order of St. George stated. The blast hit “two church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping.”\n\nThe Church of St. Porphyrius’s original structure dated to the 5th century, and the current structure, in a historic quarter of the city, was built in the 12th century. It is named for a former bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, and placed where he is believed to have died in A. D. 420. The church, characterized by thick walls and a richly decorated interior, has long been a place of refuge and community for its members, who are a religious minority in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA Palestinian American woman who moved from Gaza to the United States in the early 2000s said in an interview that she had relatives and friends sheltering in the church at the time of the strike, some of whom were injured.\n\n“They’re terrified. They’re shaken. They don’t know what to do, and they don’t know where else to go,” said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her family’s safety. She expressed outrage at the idea that more than 1 million civilians could evacuate from a place as densely populated and heavily bombed as Gaza City — a mass movement called for by Israel last week. “It’s impossible,” she said.\n\nShe said that she grew up going to the Church of St. Porphyrius and that her family has deep ties to the church, dating to when they became refugees during the 1948 founding of Israel and mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nDescribing the congregation as close-knit and family-like, she said she’s not only worried about her relatives. “I’m concerned for everyone because we’re a small community.”\n\nChristians make up about 1 percent of Gaza’s population and have faced restrictions and discrimination by the Hamas government, according to human rights groups. During the 2014 Gaza war, about 1,000 Palestinian Muslims fled Israeli shelling for the Church of St. Porphyrius, where graves were damaged by shrapnel from a nearby strike, Reuters reported.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nMedicaid’s prescription for health includes food and housing in some statesThe Rev. Carl Nichols uses his cargo van to deliver boxes of shelf-stable foods and meats to people with food insecurity in eastern North Carolina. (Kate Medley)On Sundays, the Rev. Carl Nichols preaches at Big Zion AME Zion Church in little Kenansville on North Carolina’s coastal plain. Tuesdays to Fridays, he drives a cargo van on a daily 320-mile circuit along rural roads edged with pine and fields of tobacco, collards and corn. His mission: delivering boxes of food to people who cannot always afford their own. The minister, his wife, two grown daughters and three helpers make up a tiny nonprofit whose food deliveries are part of an experiment that places North Carolina at a leading edge of the new face of Medicaid. A pillar of the nation’s social safety net since the 1960s, Medicaid is the largest public source of health insurance. Now, it is becoming something more.A growing number of states are broadening the health-coverage program into a hub for fulfilling social needs: helping with housing and transportation, easing past prison life and domestic violence, and providing the cardboard boxes filled with canned goods and perishables that Nichols and his crew deliver in two counties of southeastern North Carolina.With the encouragement of the Biden administration, Medicaid is threading health-related social needs into the program. Because Medicaid is a joint responsibility of the federal government and states, each project stepping into such new territory requires federal approval. Since President Biden took office three years ago, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved these experiments in eight states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington.An additional nine states have applied, and three others — California and Massachusetts, as well as North Carolina — are asking to update projects they have begun.“We have states constantly knocking on the door to do this,” said Daniel Tsai, CMS’s Medicaid director.In a time of political schisms, the enthusiasm is bipartisan. In January 2021, the final days of the Trump administration, CMS suggested to states ways that they could use Medicaid and other public insurance to cope with social needs.For the Biden administration, the focus on such needs jibes with efforts to lessen health inequities, including the recent U.S. Playbook to Address Social Determinants of Health. CMS worked for more than a year with the White House and other government departments and, in November, produced guidelines on what services states can add under Medicaid — including up to six months’ rent, utility subsidies and nutritious food. States can devote no more than 3 percent of their overall Medicaid spending to such experiments. They must chip in state money and evaluate the effects.“Clearly, nobody is saying that Medicaid is here to solve all housing and nutritional needs in the country, nor are we here to take over other agencies,” such as the Housing and Urban Development or Agriculture departments, Tsai said. “Does Medicaid have a role in social needs? The answer is yes. … It’s exciting. It’s groundbreaking. It is not an open check.”Medicaid already was a godsend for Montiara Brown, who hasn’t worked at a steady job since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when Concentrix, a contractor for the local phone company, closed down. She was on maternity leave, with a baby she named Messiah because he seems a miracle to her, having been told since surgery as a girl that she could never carry a successful pregnancy.After joining Medicaid in summer 2020, she was able to get glasses to replace a pair she had broken a couple of years before and gone without — even though her vision is so poor she couldn’t make out individual leaves on the ground — hoping her contact lenses wouldn’t rip. She got a Pap smear, and now could get medicine if she got sick.But she was suffering from asthma and depression living with her toddler in a cramped one-bedroom apartment outside Greenville, N.C., with no floor space between her bed and a little plastic bed for Messiah.“I was sinking and didn’t have any way out,” Brown, 34, said.She told a friend last summer that she wished she could move, and the friend suggested she tell the managed-care company that handles her Medicaid. A woman there said it sounded as if she might be a candidate for something called the North Carolina Healthy Opportunities Pilots. When Brown’s phone rang, she nearly didn’t answer, wary of strangers’ calls, but found on the other end a person from Access East, one of three organizations that coordinate community groups under this Medicaid experiment, with questions about Brown’s health and her life. One question was whether she could afford rent month to month. She could, scraping together earnings from babysitting her sister’s kids and her truck-driver father sometimes helping out.There was no way she could have enough at once for a security deposit and first month’s rent and utility bills. That’s where North Carolina’s experiment came in, picking up those costs.She remembers still not believing what was happening Oct. 13, when she was handed the key to a two-bedroom apartment with a full kitchen, including a dishwasher she had to be taught to use because she’d never had one before. And for the first time in her life, brand new furniture, including a Spider-Man bed and comforter set for Messiah, who just turned 4.“I like to go look at him in his own room,” she said. Her old place “was keeping me depressed. It was dark,” Brown said. “If you’re in a place of light, you’ll be light,” she said. Her new apartment has seven windows.The Medicaid experiment that has led Nichols to hand out food boxes and Brown into a light-filled apartment is part of a trend that has become all the rage lately across a broad swath of the U.S. health-care system.A “Sync for Social Needs” coalition, announced by the White House in 2022, coordinates health plans, health systems, government agencies and electronic health record vendors in a shared goal of standardizing patients’ records to show whether they have been screened for social risks.Last year, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which evaluates health plans and medical practitioners, updated a data tool used by 90 percent of health plans, requiring them to report whether they have assessed patients for shortages of housing, transportation and food.And Medicare, the federal insurance system for people who are older or have disabilities, ordered doctors seeking bonuses in an incentive pay program to ask patients about food insecurity, unstable housing and personal safety.A year ago, the organization that accredits U.S. hospitals began requiring them to ask a selection of their patients whether they have unmet health-related social needs and offer advice on getting help.This wave of attention to social needs grows out of a recognition, going back at least three decades, that social determinants of health — essentially, the conditions in which people live — have an enormous bearing on well-being. Medical care, studies have shown, accounts for only 20 percent of the difference in patients’ health, while social risk factors are responsible for half to 80 percent.“If you are trying to offer health care to improve health, and [a patient] is not able to afford a healthy diet or have a place to live, you end up spinning your wheels,” said Seth A. Berkowitz, associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.At its core, the marbling of social services into Medicaid has two goals: improving patients’ health and making a dent in the nation’s exorbitant medical costs.The new CMS guidelines say that any service a state chooses to include must be based on evidence it makes a difference. It remains unclear whether all this works.“There is this incredible enthusiasm this will be a magic pill,” said Laura Gottlieb, professor of family and community medicine at the University of California at San Francisco.Yet for now, “the evidence is not anywhere close to supporting these activities,” said Gottlieb, founding co-director of the Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network, which focuses on the intersection of social and medical care. “The research is [running] behind the policymakers.”A 2022 report by the Department of Health and Human Services synthesized research into older projects, largely outside Medicaid, that have tried to help. It concluded that safe and stable housing has been tied to better health, as has availability of nutritious food.Still, the report acknowledged that many studies have limitations, making it difficult to tell whether the services are the actual cause of improvements in patient health.Some of the largest evaluations of such efforts have produced unpromising results. A 2018 study by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine assessed programs that provided permanent housing, with other support, for people who had been chronically homeless. Except for those with HIV/AIDS, the study concluded, “there is no substantial published evidence as yet to demonstrate the [housing and other help] improves health outcomes or reduces health-care costs.”Thomas D’Aunno, professor of management at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, co-wrote a recent article in JAMA Health Forum contending that hospitals, health systems and policymakers should “tread warily” into the realm of social needs, saying such a trend “has real risks,” including diverting money from other useful purposes, and “few prospects of success.”When it comes to Medicaid with its low-income beneficiaries, D’Aunno said in an interview, “it is a good idea to try. The issue is, how would Medicaid know how to spend money on housing? They don’t have the expertise.” Instead of lowering health-care spending, D’Aunno said, screening Medicaid beneficiaries for unmet needs “uncovers more problems. You find, ‘Oh my gosh, this person hasn’t seen a dentist.’ So the cost goes up for a while.”The Medicaid projects, UCSF’s Gottlieb said, are “a good opportunity to say, ‘Let’s see what happens.’”As many parts of the health-care system race to identify patients with unmet social needs that can weaken health, Medicaid is going significantly further, covering services for some of the most vulnerable people.Oregon is building on an older program to create a path to stable housing. Starting in a few months, it plans to phase in a $1 billion project to provide services to beneficiaries at risk of homelessness or undergoing other transitions, such as release from incarceration or a mental health facility.The services, predicted to reach about 250,000 of the 1.4 million Oregonians on Medicaid, will include moving assistance and up to six months of rent, help affording utilities, meals tailored to a patient’s medical conditions and climate controls such as heaters and air conditioners.“I am excited and, admittedly, a little scared,” said Dave Baden, until recently the interim director of the Oregon Health Authority, which runs that state’s Medicaid program. “Does this six months of rent matter to stabilize their lives? Do I know that it will be successful? No. That’s our hypothesis we are testing.”There are growing pains. One is teaching community organizations to comply with federal medical privacy laws that are part of Medicaid, leaders of a similar project starting in Arizona say. Another is forming partnerships with landlords so the housing stock is adequate.California is evolving from an earlier experiment in which it allowed managed-care companies in Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid, to devote some government payments to housing. The experiments from 2016 to 2021 showed reductions in hospital stays and inappropriate emergency room visits, said Lindy Harrington, the state’s assistant Medicaid director.A new experiment, CalAIM, was launched in 2022 to offer help to Medi-Cal members who are at greatest risk of avoidable use of hospital beds and emergency rooms, have serious mental health or addiction troubles, are homeless or are transitioning from jails and prisons. The program helped about 140,000 people in its first year by connecting them with “community supports,” including housing, meals tailored to medical conditions and respite care after a hospital stay.Harrington said the goal is “a system that considers not simply the care that happens inside the four walls of the medical system.”Several years before becoming director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mandy Cohen arrived in North Carolina with a vision: The state should be “buying health,” not just health care. North Carolina already had decided to convert its Medicaid program to managed care and, as the state’s health secretary, Cohen proposed it also begin addressing the social drivers of health.In 2018, a year after Cohen’s arrival, CMS under President Donald Trump approved North Carolina’s experiment. The $650 million Healthy Opportunities Pilots consists of projects in three regions of the state. Delayed by the pandemic, the services — food, housing, transportation and help with “toxic stress” and interpersonal violence — began rolling out in spring 2022.In each region, an organization chosen by North Carolina’s Medicaid coordinates with social services groups, many of them shoestring nonprofits accustomed to subsisting on grants but never having worked within a government program before. As of December, nearly 16,000 of the 2.8 million North Carolinians on Medicaid had received at least one service.A preliminary evaluation found that, in the early months, services had managed to start, though it was too soon to know whether the projects were alleviating people’s needs.“Everyone understands that what we are seeing over a short period of time doesn’t tell the whole story,” said UNC’s Berkowitz, lead evaluator of the experiment.Access East, a nonprofit in northeastern North Carolina, was selected to coordinate the Medicaid experiment in nine counties, most of them poor and rural with vacant farmland, one-stoplight towns, rickety houses and little public transit. Last year, the nonprofit received $2.3 million to line up community groups, pay salaries, do marketing and community outreach.“We are still finding things that need to be tweaked or … done completely differently,” said Tina Dixon, vice president for health opportunities at Access East. One challenge is building trust with people wary of accepting help from strangers. Another is teaching small community groups to file claims with the Medicaid bureaucracy.The biggest “pain point,” Dixon said, has been software built to track beneficiaries with needs, refer them for help and handle invoices and reimbursements. When the software balks, community groups don’t get paid quickly, prompting some to pause services such as food deliveries and car repair, because they cannot absorb the financial risk. Dixon savors the potential to help poor people be well but said, “we are still building this aircraft while we are flying it.”Nichols, the North Carolina pastor, named his nonprofit CR Resource Center after himself and his wife, Wanda Renee. He navigated the bureaucracy to get a Medicaid number. He went through a background check and signed up for food box delivering through another regional coordinator, Community Care of the Lower Cape Fear.His wife, with three decades’ experience from a small trucking firm they still operate part of the year, and one of their daughters handle the administrative work. They call new clients, verify locations, set up delivery schedules. The following week, Nichols goes out to introduce himself and invite recipients to let him know if they don’t like green beans so he can put in sweet corn instead.They have about 350 clients. Nichols’s route takes eight to 11 hours, depending on whether people are in the mood to tell him about personal matters. Medicaid pays $150.36 a trip per client, which covers buying the food and delivering a laden cardboard box, though sometimes Nichols uses his own money to buy meat if he knows someone will be home and can use it fresh.Later this winter, he plans to expand into a third county.“Medicaid, that’s the business they are in — to help people in need,” Nichols said. “I might be totally wrong about this, but somebody has got to come to the plate. If not for the government, who?”",

He could build a good life there, they said, maybe even in Seattle, a city where his family had long roots.\n\nKatsman, 32, was adamant. He wanted to return to Israel and the small commune where he had lived for years. He was committed to forging a more peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians. His dissertation was dedicated to “all life forms that exist between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.”\n\nKatsman was hiding in a closet with a neighbor, Avital Alajem, when militants overran the kibbutz. He was closest to the door, Alajem told CNN, and his body absorbed the bullets, protecting Alajem. “He was murdered,” Alajem said. “I was saved.”\n\nKatsman was a rare combination, friends said. He was a gifted scholar but also a car mechanic, landscaper and DJ. He worked hard yet always had time for his friends, whether to help them move or catch up over a beer.\n\nHis mother, Hannah Wacholder Katsman, grew up in Cincinnati, while his father, Daniel Katsman, is from Seattle. The family moved to Israel in 1990, and Hayim, the second of six siblings, was born a year later.\n\nA dual U. S.-Israeli citizen, Katsman won a prize for an academic paper he wrote about contemporary religious Zionism. “I really think his work helped illuminate some of the very dynamics that have brought us to this horrific moment,” said Liora Halperin, a historian at the University of Washington. “There are many pieces to this puzzle, but he had devoted years of his life trying to understand some of the pieces.”\n\nIn the first days after the attacks, his mother was unable to arrange her son’s funeral amid the chaos of so many deaths. But she knew one thing. He “wouldn’t want this conflict to be used to kill innocent people,” she said. “He would want this conflict to end as soon as possible.”",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nA death sentence: Native Americans have least access to liver transplant systemDespite being more likely to die of liver disease, Native Americans are far less likely to make the transplant list than WhitesLee Yaiva stands in one of the conference rooms at the Scottsdale Recovery Center on October 7. (Sharon Chischilly for the Markup)Native Americans are far less likely than other racial groups to gain a spot on the national liver transplant list, despite having the highest rate of death from liver disease, according to an analysis of four years of transplant data by the Markup and The Washington Post. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.Compared to their total number of deaths from liver disease, White people gain a spot on the transplant list almost three times more often than Native Americans, the data shows. Had transplant rates been equal, nearly 1,000 additional Native people would have received liver transplants between 2018 and 2021.Native Americans who do win a spot on the list advance to surgery at about the same rate as White people, showing that front-end access is a primary driver of disparity. Among other racial groups, the liver transplant acceptance rate for Black people is slightly lower than for White patients nationally, while Asian Americans have the highest rate of acceptance to the transplant wait list by far.Skip to end of carouselThis report is a joint investigation by The Washington Post and the Markup, a nonprofit newsroom that challenges technology to serve the public good.These findings come as mortality from liver disease is climbing across the nation, hitting nearly 57,000 deaths in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Liver disease is commonly caused by obesity, hepatitis C and alcoholism. Researchers have attributed the rise in mortality to increased heavy drinking during the coronavirus pandemic, especially among young people.Data shows poor access to inpatient treatment for alcoholism for tribes across the country. The only cure for end-stage liver disease is a transplant. And getting on the list typically involves referral by a doctor, which can be hard for those with limited resources to access.Architects of the U.S. transplant system have wrestled with how to equitably distribute the scarce resources since the program’s inception 40 years ago, concerned that organs would flow to the privileged. Yet decades later, inequities persist.Liver disease deaths have long been an epidemic in Indian Country, where Native Americans are four times more likely to die of liver disease than non-Hispanic White people, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is the second leading cause of death among Indigenous men ages 35 to 44.Lee Yaiva said every time he went home to the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona, he found that alcoholism had claimed another victim. In July 2022, it was a brother, then in his early 30s. A month later, a second brother died, at 29.Yaiva said both brothers were aware their drinking had taken a toll on their livers. The family declined an autopsy in the first death. In the second, doctors confirmed that the brother’s liver had shut down. While cleaning out his house, Yaiva discovered dozens of empty bottles of cough syrup, one of the only sources of alcohol on a reservation where it’s not sold.Living on a rural reservation without cars of their own, the brothers found it difficult to get to the local Indian Health Service (IHS) clinic, the only place where Yaiva said his brothers received medical care. Getting to a transplant center in Phoenix four hours away was unthinkable. He said his brothers never considered a transplant. As far as he knows, the option was not offered.Yaiva said he believes part of the reason his brothers died untreated was poverty. Transplant professionals agree poverty can be a barrier and add the lack of paid time off and unreliable transportation as other factors.“They kind of accept” death, Yaiva said. “It has a lot to do with self-worth.”Loretta Christensen, the IHS’s chief medical officer, said liver disease patients from Indian Country are often diagnosed late, limiting their options. And they may not know a liver transplant is a possibility.“We need to increase public education,” Christensen said. “We certainly want those who may need a transplant to get that information.”For this story, The Post and the Markup compared national transplant figures with an indicator of transplant need: the rate of liver disease mortality for each racial group, as measured by the CDC. The results: For every 100 Asian people who died of liver disease, approximately 68 patients were accepted for transplant from 2018 to 2021. Among White people, 26 patients were accepted; among Black people, it was 23. (Latinos are assigned to various racial groups in the data and are excluded from this analysis.)Among Indigenous people, just nine patients were accepted for transplant in that period for every 100 people who died of liver disease.“The unevenness in access and outcomes is a problem for all of us,” said Jewel Mullen, who has examined disparities in organ transplants and is the associate dean for health equity at the University of Texas at Austin’s medical school.“They limit our ability to be as healthy as we can be as a society. And I want to believe that at our core [there] is still some fundamental belief in fairness.”In some parts of the country, racial disparities appeared particularly stark. In D.C. and Arkansas, for example, White people were twice as likely as Black people to be added to the liver transplant list when compared to their rates of death from liver disease.“It’s not like people saying, ‘Oh, you are Black, you aren’t going to get it,’” said Nikhilesh Mazumder, a gastroenterologist at University of Michigan Health. Mazumder believes it’s more that the history of race in the United States — and its persistent connection to poverty — has “ended up stacking the deck against referral.”And even small national differences can add up: An estimated 430 additional Black people would have been accepted for liver transplants from 2018 to 2021 had national transplant rates been equal.In 2022, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reported that an individual’s chance of being added to the transplant list “varies greatly based on race and ethnicity, gender, geographic location, socioeconomic status (SES), disability status, and immigration status.”Kenneth Kizer, who chaired the report’s committee and is best known for reshaping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in the 1990s, said “the responsibility lies with HRSA,” the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency under HHS.Kizer is not alone in that assessment. When Congress established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network in 1984 to oversee the allocation of the nation’s organ supply, lawmakers mandated that a task force convene to make “recommendations for assuring equitable access.”“We were trying to make sure it would be available for everybody regardless of race or income,” said former Oklahoma senator Don Nickles, a Republican who co-sponsored the legislation. “We wanted the opportunity to be there to save lives.”For decades, federal law has required the network to increase transplantation among “racial and ethnic minority groups and among populations with limited access to transportation,” but neither the network nor its administrator, the United Network for Organ Sharing, pointed to efforts made to address inequities in access to the liver transplant wait list.Since 2000, HHS has required the network to collect information about “patients who were inappropriately kept off a waiting list,” but it has never happened.“If we don’t have that data, we are not going to be able to understand where to intervene,” said Rachel Patzer, an epidemiologist who leads the health research organization the Regenstrief Institute and former chair of the organ network’s data advisory committee. Patzer pushed for 15 years to jump-start the data collection process but said she was stymied by red tape.Anne Paschke, a spokesperson for the United Network for Organ Sharing, agreed that the data is crucial but said her organization doesn’t have the authority to collect it; HRSA did not dispute that it is holding up data collection and did not answer questions about the more than two-decade delay.HRSA spokesperson Martin Kramer said in a written statement that the agency is in the midst of the “most significant overhaul of the organ transplantation system in decades,” including plans to improve data collection.Experts say data about who is denied transplants could shine a spotlight on inequities at transplant centers.Because organs are in short supply nationally, transplant teams are selective about who is placed on the list. But no federal rules require transplant centers to make their selection criteria public.Two centers acknowledge that they will not accept patients with alcohol-associated liver disease unless they are six months sober. The rule stems from fear the new liver would be destroyed by continued drinking. But doctors began abandoning this policy more than a decade ago after research showed that carefully selected patients who had not established six months of sobriety before transplant were nonetheless thriving two years after receiving a new liver.More than a dozen others either did not respond or declined to provide their policies.“We were letting a lot of young people die who really should have been transplanted,” Russell Rosenblatt, a transplant hepatologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, said of the six-month rule.Changes in national policy can improve equity. Before 2002, data showed that Black patients were more likely than White patients to die waiting for a liver transplant. Then, transplant centers rolled out a new way of measuring severity of the disease, so sicker patients could be identified and given higher priority. A study published in 2008 in the influential journal JAMA found this new measurement — known as the MELD score, for Model for End-Stage Liver Disease — radically improved outcomes for Black people on the liver transplant list, wiping out their disparities in deaths in the four years examined.Donna Cryer, who leads the nonprofit Global Liver Institute, said inequity begins long before a transplant becomes necessary. Patients without access to regular primary care may not be screened for liver disease. The disease is often treated by gastroenterologists or hepatologists, who in turn make referrals to transplant centers when a patients’ illness becomes life-threatening.“We see a lot of patients drop off” at the specialist stage, Cryer said. “The incentives on finding more people are not there.”Several transplant experts said lack of reliable transportation and living far from a transplant center can also put the surgery out of reach. Patients on the transplant list must be able to get to routine exams and care leading up to their surgery, and they need to be able to get to a hospital at a moment’s notice should an organ match become available. Patients sometimes move to live near their hospital for this reason — if they can afford it.In August, Yaiva, the Hopi citizen, was shattered to learn that a third brother had been found dead a week before his 38th birthday.Though the family again declined an autopsy, Yaiva said, he again suspected years of alcoholism had taken their toll. Near the end, yellowed skin and a bloated body put the often silent, slow-moving disease on sickly display.“I feel bad for my mom,” he said. “It’s a constant tragedy.”Yaiva won his own battle with alcoholism a decade ago and went on to become CEO of Scottsdale Recovery Center, which offers culturally informed inpatient programs for Native American clients.While the Affordable Care Act now requires insurance to cover addiction treatment, Yaiva said many Native Americans struggle to pay for sober housing and other care to support their sobriety. One in four Indigenous Americans lives in poverty, according to census data, the highest of any racial group.Citizens of recognized tribes have a right to free health care under federal law following century-old treaties. Still, the IHS fails to provide services needed at many stages of liver disease and addiction treatment, its data shows.Though the agency serves a population of 2.6 million people with the highest rate of drug- and alcohol-related deaths in the United States, the IHS paid claims for inpatient substance-use treatment for an average of just 18 patients a year from 2018 to 2022.“The whole country is not getting the addiction treatment that they need broadly, but particularly in Indian Country, there are huge health disparities,” said Monica Skewes, a psychology professor at Montana State University and investigator at the Center for American Indian and Rural Health Equity.The IHS outsources most addiction treatment to tribal programs, but the quality varies. The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation in North Dakota, known as the MHA Nation, is wealthy from oil and gas revenue and has its own inpatient and sober living facilities.But on the Montana reservation where Skewes does work, she said counselors with little training provide outpatient care. When she began a pilot substance-use treatment program there, community members asked that participants be served full meals instead of snacks, quadrupling the food budget.“Otherwise, they are literally too hungry to pay attention,” Skewes said.The IHS has long struggled to pay for services outside its hospitals and clinics. “Many sites were limited to authorizing payment solely for life and limb-threatening emergencies,” IHS spokesperson Nicole Adams said in a written statement.Adams said recent changes, including the implementation of Medicare-like reimbursement rates, has allowed the agency to stretch its dollars further and provide more services. Lack of addiction treatment is “profound in Indian Country in rural and extreme rural areas,” Adams said, and is a “pressing challenge for the agency.” She declined to comment on whether liver disease care is currently adequate.IHS officials have repeatedly asked for more federal funding, arguing that it is forced to defer tens of thousands of requests from patients annually for everything from eyeglasses to treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. IHS data show the agency deferred nearly 113,000 patient requests to see specialists from 2018 to 2022, including 6,196 requests to see gastroenterologists, who treat liver disease and make referrals to transplant centers.Hepatologists also treat liver disease, but deferrals for that specialty are not broken out in IHS records. However, agency data shows it paid claims for an average of just 226 patients a year to see hepatologists. Rates were similar for gastroenterologists.IHS patients may sign up for Medicaid, Medicare or seek insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces, something IHS staff members routinely recommend. When a patient has access to other coverage, the IHS becomes the payer of last resort.Claim data shows the agency chipped in very little to the cost of liver transplantation, averaging $11,200 per patient. That is about 2 percent of the $650,000 billed for the average procedure, according to the actuarial and consulting firm Milliman. With medication, recovery and other costs, the price can soar to nearly $900,000.From 2018 to 2022, the agency kicked in funding for just six liver transplants. During the same period, it deferred 105 requests for transplants of all organ types.Adams, the IHS spokesperson, said some requests that are initially deferred may be approved later.Scarcity extends beyond the IHS. Large swaths of the country have no liver transplant centers, including the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, which are home to more than two dozen Native American reservations.Monica Mayer is a representative on the Tribal Business Council for the MHA Nation. As a former IHS physician, she has seen firsthand what happens when liver disease is not treated in its early stages. Patients show up in emergency rooms well past the point where their lives might have been saved.“IHS is not doing a good job of taking care of us,” she said.Mayer eventually rose to become chief medical officer of the IHS Great Plains Area before serving in tribal government. She said better addiction services are essential to stopping a “devastating” loss of life that has left some small tribes facing cultural extinction.With every preventable death, Mayer said, “we lose the ability to pass on traditions, our way of life, our language.”To conduct this analysis, reporters obtained data through several Freedom of Information Act requests to the Health Resources and Services Administration, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Indian Health Service.The response from the HRSA included several anonymized data sets through March 2022 on liver transplants, the donors who provided livers, the candidates waiting for potential transplants, and the hospitals performing liver recoveries and transplants. The IHS provided reports about the number of paid claims for tribal citizens as well as unmet requests. Reporters also used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the number of deaths from liver disease and cirrhosis that occurred in each state as an indicator of the need for liver transplants, as all candidates on the liver transplant wait list have end-stage liver disease.The chief methodological decisions reporters relied on for the analysis included limiting the HRSA data only to adult candidates and transplant recipients; removing candidates needing non-liver transplants, and choosing to focus on transplants, wait list candidates, and deaths between 2018 and 2021.The ratio of people who die of liver disease vs. those who are added to the liver transplant wait list, compared by racial group.The number of claims that the Indian Health Services paid for services related to liver disease care.The number of services requested for liver-disease-related care that were deferred by the Indian Health Service.For a more detailed methodology, including links to the analysis scripts, see the Markup’s full methodology here.This report is a joint investigation by The Washington Post and the Markup, a nonprofit newsroom that challenges technology to serve the public good.Annie Gilbertson is a freelance investigative reporter based in Berkeley, Calif., who writes about criminal justice, technology and education.

  "text": "The stunning move comes amid technical and budgetary challenges for the JPL’s most ambitious mission, Mars Sample Return, a partnership with the European Space Agency that is designed to bring Martian soil back to Earth for scrutiny in laboratories. Planetary scientists think such samples might hold evidence of past Martian life.\n\n“Today I’m writing to share some difficult news,” JPL director Laurie Leshin wrote in a grim memo to employees Tuesday. “While we still do not have an FY24 appropriation or the final word from Congress on our Mars Sample Return (MSR) budget allocation, we are now in a position where we must take further significant action to reduce our spending, which will result in layoffs of JPL employees and an additional release of contractors.”\n\nThe Mars Sample Return mission has already racked up some major triumphs. The rover Perseverance, which landed on Mars in February 2021, has dug up and stored intriguing samples of Martian soil. It’s the “return” part of the mission that’s dicey. Getting the samples back to Earth will require novel feats of aerospace engineering.\n\nGetting samples of Mars back to Earth for close scrutiny by scientists will take longer and cost more money than NASA had anticipated, according to a scathing Independent Review Board report released last year. According to a November report in Spacenews.com, NASA officials had instructed three NASA centers working on Mars Sample Return to “start ramping back on activity” related to the mission.\n\nIn the Tuesday memo, Leshin explained that NASA had previously instructed JPL to allocate $300 million in fiscal 2024 for Mars Sample Return, a decrease of 63 percent from 2023. That figure is consistent with the lower end of congressional markups on the NASA budget. The budget uncertainty led to a hiring freeze at JPL and cuts to budgets and the contractor workforce, she wrote.\n\n“Unfortunately, those actions alone are not enough for us to make it through the remainder of the fiscal year. So in the absence of an appropriation, and as much as we wish we didn’t need to take this action, we must now move forward to protect against even deeper cuts later were we to wait,” she wrote.\n\nJPL has a fabled past in robotic space science. The Pasadena, Calif., laboratory managed the Viking and Voyager missions of the 1970s and, more recently, landed multiple rovers on Mars. The JPL-built Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch in October on a mission to an icy Jupiter moon known to have a subsurface ocean.\n\nBut its most important mission, officials have said, is Mars Sample Return. It is a high priority for planetary scientists, who suspect Mars was once congenial to life. Although Perseverance, like the still-operational Curiosity rover that preceded it, has instruments that can inspect and test Martian soil, scientists believe they need the material in their laboratories to tease out the full history of the Red Planet.\n\nIt’s also a complicated endeavor. The plan involves landing another spacecraft on Mars to collect the samples obtained by Perseverance. Then the samples will be launched into Mars orbit to rendezvous with yet another spacecraft that would haul everything back to Earth.\n\nHowever, the mission “was established with unrealistic budget and schedule expectations from the beginning,” according to the Independent Review Board report. “As a result, there is currently no credible, congruent technical, nor properly margined schedule, cost, and technical baseline that can be accomplished with the likely available funding.”\n\n“I’m extremely disappointed with the impending JPL layoffs announced today, and my thoughts are with the workers who will be impacted and their families,” Chu said. “These cuts will devastate workers and Southern California in the short-term, and they hurt the long-term viability of not just our Mars Exploration Program but also many years of scientific discovery to come.”\n\nWednesday is shaping up as particularly stressful. Most of the workforce at JPL has been instructed by Leshin to work remotely while employees learn if they still have a job.\n\n“I am directing most employees to work from home tomorrow, Wednesday, February 7, so everyone can be in a safe, comfortable environment on a stressful day. Most individuals will not be able to enter the Lab during this mandatory remote work day,” Leshin wrote.\n\nPerseverance, meanwhile, is continuing its mission on a planet that at the moment is roughly 213 million miles away. The rover is supposed to climb out of Jezero Crater, where it has been digging up samples of sedimentary rocks in what was a river delta billions of years ago.",

  "text": "KIMMERIDGE, England — There was this thing on the beach. It looked like a tree trunk? But when they saw the fangs, the lethal grin of an apex predator, they knew. They had found a pliosaur, one of the rarest of the rare, and the most fearsome marine reptile that ever lived — the saltwater version of Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nThe fossilized pliosaur snout was discovered in 2022 by a textile artist and self-described dinosaur hunter named Philip Jacobs, who happened upon it while walking in southern England, in an area known as the Jurassic Coast for all its prehistoric finds. The snout was a little smushed but amazingly intact, and its position on the beach led a team to find the rest of the skull on the nearby crumbling cliff face, which was excavated — via ropes and pneumatic jackhammers — by a former plumber and fellow fossil obsessive named Steve Etches.\n\nThe skull was winched up the cliff with the help of local farmer, stored in his barn and then — in a Hollywood ending almost too cute to be true — presented to the world on New Year’s Day by one of the most beloved men in Britain, naturalist Sir David Attenborough, in his latest BBC television documentary, “Attenborough and the Giant Sea Monster.”\n\nThe restored pliosaur fossil skull went on display here at the Etches Collection last month, and the little seaside museum has been packed with record crowds ever since.\n\nThe 74-year-old Etches is lean, wiry and to-the-point. His decades spent digging up the past, what he calls “the stories from deep time,” have convinced him that life is lived with intensity because every species — even ours, especially ours? — has its expiration date.\n\n“Maybe someone sees fossils in the drawer and asks, isn’t it boring?” He shook his head. “No, it is not boring. It is life and death and violence. It’s evade and evolve and —”\n\nBecause this pliosaur, if he or she were anything, was an eating machine, who dined on the primordial sharks and dolphin-like ichthyosaurs of its day like all-you-can-eat California rolls.\n\nAs Etches tells it, the creature was 32 feet long, with a bullet-shaped snout, a thick neck and a set of triangular striated teeth that could be almost a foot long. It was propelled by four paddling appendages and might have been capable of speeds of 30 mph.\n\nSome suspect it swam very fast, like a penguin. Others think it might have moved a little slower, more like a sea turtle. No doubt it was a marine reptile, distinct from dinosaurs, which were terrestrial reptiles.\n\nEtches, who had never climbed on a rope before he dangled off the cliff face to save the pliosaur fossil from tumbling into the sea, is an expert on the Kimmeridgian deposits that line the coast outside his front door, an ancient ocean floor laid down 157 million to 152 million years ago in the Jurassic Period.\n\nThe pliosaur that he and his colleagues excavated and study settled into the muck on a shallow sea then located around the spot where northern Morocco is today. Etches imagines that the warm tropical waters, beneath humid skies saturated with carbon dioxide, made for quite the habitat.\n\n“It was absolutely teeming with life,” he said, filled with creatures now long gone, but with many others — and their evolved kin — still around today.\n\nThis gets a laugh. “It’s nice to hear it,” says the naturalist, who then probes: “Okay, let me ask you the million-dollar question. In a battle between T. rex and our pliosaur, who is going to win?”\n\nEtches believes that the rest of the pliosaur is waiting to be excavated from the cliff face. “I am convinced,” he said. They are trying to raise the funds — about $300,000 — to recover the whole fossilized skeleton, which might measure 30 feet or more, and reveal vertebrae, ribs, flippers, tail — and even fossilized stomach contents. It is a race against time, as the exposed mudstone cliffs turn into wet clay with every storm.",

  "text": "No NFL team ever has won three straight Super Bowls. But with Mahomes in his prime, Andy Reid vowing Sunday night to coach on, Rashee Rice developing into a true No. 1 wide receiver and the best defense of the Mahomes era in place, the Chiefs will enter next season with a legitimate chance to pull it off.\n\n“It’s an ongoing thing in the NFL,” Mahomes said. “I think Tom [Brady] said it best: Once you win that championship and you have those parades and you get those rings, you’re not the champion anymore. You have to come back with that same mentality.”\n\nThe Chiefs became the NFL’s first back-to-back Super Bowl champs since the New England Patriots in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. They have succeeded the Patriots as the NFL’s reigning dynasty. They’ve played in four of the past five Super Bowls and have won three of them. They’ve played in six straight AFC championship games.\n\n“He comes to work every day humble, wanting to be great,” Reid said. “He challenges the guys around him to be great every play and never flinches. You drop the ball: ‘We’ll get the next one.’ Or ‘Listen, I need you in this spot right here.’ It’s not like chewing them out or any of that. … [He’s] a pleasure to coach, an absolute pleasure to coach.”\n\nReid turns 66 next month and faces annual questions about retirement. But he said Sunday night that though he hadn’t had time to think much about it, he planned to return to the Chiefs next season. He could be in line to receive a contract upgrade.\n\n“I believe he’s the best coach of all time,” Mahomes said. “I know he didn’t have the trophies yet [when he arrived in Kansas City], and I have a lot of respect for some of those great coaches. But the way he’s able to navigate every single team he has, continue to have success no matter where he’s at — and for me, he brings out the best of me because he lets me be me. ... He doesn’t try to make me anyone else. I don’t think I’d be the quarterback that I am if I didn’t have Coach Reid being my head coach.”\n\nThe Chiefs showed their championship mettle this season. They lost the NFL’s season-opening game to the Detroit Lions. They had a stretch in November and December in which they lost four of six. The NFL disciplined Reid and Mahomes for their conduct toward the officials following a controversial December loss to the Buffalo Bills. Tight end Travis Kelce was plagued by injuries. Mahomes lacked a reliable wideout until Rice began to put things together late in his rookie season.\n\n“It means more,” Mahomes said. “To be able to battle through that adversity and come out better on the other side, I think it prepared us for the playoffs. And, obviously, we’ve had a lot of great playoff runs. But this is going to be up there because just the way that we kind of continued to battle whenever times weren’t great.”\n\nThe Chiefs had to go on the road to beat the Bills in the divisional round of the playoffs and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC championship game. Even Sunday, they had to overcome deficits of 10-0, 16-13, 19-16 and 22-19 before outlasting the 49ers, 25-22, in the second Super Bowl ever decided in overtime.\n\n“I appreciate the first one because it took me a thousand years to get into the Super Bowl, at least to be able to hold that Lombardi Trophy,” Reid said. “So I appreciate every day that I have to do this.”\n\nGeneral Manager Brett Veach will have to deal with a list of prospective unrestricted free agents that includes two defensive standouts, lineman Chris Jones and cornerback L’Jarius Sneed. The Chiefs and Jones have a history of contentiousness over his contract. He signed a revised one-year deal in September after his holdout extended through the first game of the season.\n\n“He wants to be great,” Mahomes said. “And for someone to be in this offense and learn the offense from Coach Reid and continue to get better and better, I think he’s just at the beginning of where he’s going to end up being at. … He lives in Texas, so he’ll get to see me a lot this offseason as we continue to try to make him one of the top receivers in this league.”\n\n“It’s culture, man,” Mahomes said. “I got brought into this culture. Alex Smith was leading this team. They had the pieces in place, and Coach Reid was the ultimate leader. I got brought in. I just kind of try to exemplify that and keep pushing them to be even better. And that’s why in moments like this, we get guys [to] come through. And it truly is special. It really is special, just to be able to say we’re back-to-back champs.”",

And the trade deficit grew smaller rather than larger, as consumers stopped buying imports and began spending more on in-person services, such as movies and dining out.\n\nFed Chair Jerome H. Powell said at the end of January that higher rates are having an effect on the economy, notably via the housing market. The Fed’s rate hikes reduce demand by making credit more expensive. Indeed, sales of new homes dipped over the second half of last year as 30-year mortgage rates approached 8 percent.\n\nThey also are effectively shielding parts of the economy from the full force of tighter credit. But as companies iron out the final kinks in their freight operations and the pool of available labor stops growing, those supply-side gains will fade and the rate hikes will take a greater toll.",

  "text": "They point out that filing taxes is both free and much easier in many countries. For example, at least 47 nations offer an option unavailable in the United States: The government fills in some information on a citizen’s tax return, known as “pre-population,” saving residents some of the trouble of doing taxes themselves.\n\nDirect File, as a pilot project limited to certain states, won’t go that far. But IRS officials haven’t ruled out adding such a feature to future versions of the site, and its debut has renewed long-standing discussions about why the United States lags in this respect. According to one 2022 study that included authors from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, the IRS could correctly calculate about 45 percent of households’ taxes without collecting any additional information from the taxpayers.\n\nSkeptics, however, point to the complexity of the U. S. tax code and the strength of the commercial tax prep industry’s lobby as entrenched obstacles. And past experiments show why several U.S. states’ attempts to simplify tax returns have failed — while other countries’ programs have met with more success.\n\nThe program required taxpayers to tell their employer at the beginning of the year if they wanted to participate. Their employer would then collect a precisely-calculated dollar amount as their state tax withholding over the course of the year. The catch: Participants couldn’t claim certain state tax credits, which Roberts says were only worth $5 to $25 for most taxpayers. “As soon as they hear [they] don’t have to file an income tax return, I thought people would jump at it,” he said. “But clearly … they didn’t jump very far.”\n\nOther people who have tested return-free filing programs believe the idea remains a good one despite past disappointments. In 2005, Stanford law professor Joseph Bankman (recently better known as the father of indicted cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried) helmed an initiative in California that sent pre-filled returns to some taxpayers. Only 1 in 5 chose to use the pre-filled form.\n\nBankman now thinks that the pre-filled state forms didn’t save that much time because most of the filing effort goes into the federal return. “Even though people [who used it] loved it, people do their federal taxes first anyway,” he said. “Being able to get that same data for your state didn’t help people all that much.” A federal initiative, as he sees it, would be more effective and more popular.\n\nIn other states, the problems were technological. Ventry recalls meeting with officials in the Maryland governor’s office to speak about setting up a similar program. State leaders were interested, but their process of collecting and sorting information from state residents’ W-2s was much slower than California’s, making them unable to process the information in time to pre-fill returns, Ventry said.\n\nColorado ran into a similar problem when it tested a program, File4Me, in the 1990s. Information from W-2 data and from the federal government, which had to tell the state what the taxpayers reported on their federal returns, came in too slowly to make the program workable, recalls John Vecchiarelli, the state’s director of taxation for 31 years.\n\nIn many countries, pre-filled tax returns are the norm. A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on tax filing practices in 57 countries found that 47 offered some level of pre-population on their tax returns in 2020. In 44 of those countries, national tax agencies pre-filled residents’ wages; Czech Republic, Israel and Switzerland filled in only personal information about the taxpayer, not their income.\n\nSome countries went further than wage data, filling in income from pensions in 37 countries, from interest in 26 countries and from capital gains in 15 countries. In Australia, 88 percent of all income reported by individual taxpayers is pre-filled. Taxpayers then get the chance to make corrections to that information, typically adjusting about one out of 10 entries.\n\nRecent technological innovations have improved tax filing in several of these countries, the report points out. Singapore, for instance, extended its “No-Filing Service” in 2021 beyond wage earners to some self-employed people, starting with thousands of taxi drivers who have their income reported by companies. The tax agency tells self-employed filers what percent of their income they can deduct for expenses and then withdraws the tax payment due from their bank account.\n\nU. S. politicians, meanwhile, have talked of pre-filling returns at the federal level for decades. U.S. presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama have vowed to get it done. In 1998, Congress passed a law that required the IRS to start pre-filling tax returns for “appropriate” taxpayers within a decade. But the IRS never did.\n\nThe Treasury Department published a report in 2003 on what it would take to follow that law. It noted that the United States has more complicated deductions and credits than most countries, and that Americans wouldn’t want pre-filled returns if it meant getting their refunds later in the year.",

  "text": "Being laid off is typically a private experience: A human resources representative delivers the news to a worker, who might be shocked or upset. But last month, Brittany Pietsch, a young account executive at the tech company Cloudflare, made public the conversation where she learned she was losing her job. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.“Enjoy the trauma! :)” says a caption early in a 9-minute video posted on TikTok capturing the emotional roller coaster of Pietsch’s call with representatives from human resources, whom she’d never met before. Pietsch grows frustrated as she’s told she did not meet performance expectations, saying she’d gotten strong reviews from her manager and pressing for an explanation as to why she’s being let go.\n\n“It must be very easy for you to have these 10-minute, 15-minute meetings, tell someone they’re fired, completely wreck their whole life and then that’s it,” Pietsch tells the HR representatives in the video. To her, it felt “like a slap in the face.”\n\nCloudflare did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post. Cloudflare’s CEO Matthew Prince said on X, formerly Twitter, that the video was “painful” to watch, noting that “managers should always be involved” in a dismissal and that “no employee should ever actually be surprised they weren’t performing.”\n\nAs thousands of workers have been laid off across the tech, media and financial industries in recent months, videos like Pietsch’s have cropped up repeatedly as young people open up about being out of work. Young workers say they find catharsis and connection in cataloguing the havoc layoffs have wreaked on their finances and mental health. As they vent about the impersonal nature of the job search in the age of AI recruiters, they’re also being open about their willingness to walk away from work that’s unfulfilling.\n\nTheir candor marks a stark change from the shame and silence that used to accompany unemployment. While some have criticized such workers as being naive to the realities of the job market, experts say the impulse to share is helping young workers process a painful aspect of working life.\n\n“There’s a lot of benefit to people saying, ‘Hey, this is what the workforce is actually like,’” said Morgan Sanner, a Gen Z expert in Columbus, Ohio, who also works in human resources. “It has offered a way for people to feel less alone in the corporate space.”\n\nAlmost immediately, Pietsch’s post sparked online outrage and appreciation. Some commended Pietsch, who did not respond to The Post’s request for comment, for sharing her experience and shamed the company for its impersonal approach to layoffs. Others argued that posting the video, which has racked up over 2 million views, could hurt Pietsch’s career.\n\n“An employee who feels he or she was treated unfairly may feel it would help to use social media to share the process of being laid off,” Benton-Hayes said in an email to The Post. “I typically wouldn’t recommend my clients recording their layoff process, unless they were suspicious of illegal conduct and they want to prove it.”\n\nOn Instagram, Chloe Shih, who worked for Discord, catalogued her growing unease as job losses swept through the tech industry at the start of the year. Last month, Discord said it would cut 17 percent of its staff, about 170 jobs. “Twitch just announced their big layoffs, so that scares me,” she said on Jan. 11, highlighting another company thinning its ranks. “It is what it is, nobody is safe.”\n\nGen Zers, who are poised to become the third-largest age cohort in the workforce this year, and younger millennials are experiencing more work-related burnout than older generations, according to 2022 data from Gallup. Employees who experience significant burnout are more likely to leave their jobs, Gallup’s report notes.\n\nRight before Christmas, Piper Phillips left a job she loved with nothing else lined up. For over a year, the 23-year-old had enjoyed working remotely as marketing director for a start-up in New York City. But after a work trip where she’d gotten to savor the company of colleagues at meetings, happy hours and dinners, she decided she wanted to work in-person.\n\nIn her journal the day before she quit, Phillips promised herself not to let the job search stress her out. Rather than desperately “hunt” for a job, she reframed the process as more carefree “job shopping.” She wanted to explore options and find a great fit, she explained on TikTok, where she’s been documenting her search.\n\nPhillips knows there is “so much privilege” in being able to walk away from her old role, and that not everyone can be choosy. (She had savings to fall back on, and puts the money she makes from TikTok toward her rent.) She’s heard from plenty of people who said it was “ridiculous” to quit her old job, telling her that work “isn’t supposed to be fun.” But mostly she’s heard from other young workers who feel emboldened by her positive spin on job-seeking.\n\n“I got so many comments of, ‘Oh my god, I did this, too, and it was the best thing I could have done’ or ‘I wish I could do this,’” Phillips said.\n\nMany younger workers are finding the job market tough to navigate, according to career consultant Mimi Gonzalez, because the pandemic disrupted their ability to build relationships. Some are “terrified” to talk to people they don’t know, she said, making it hard to network and interview.\n\nSince the fall, Meolah Delinois has been searching for part-time work she can start immediately and a summer internship. A graduate student in Delaware, the 22-year-old said she’s been frustrated as recruiters reach out and then go months without responding. She’s repeatedly shown up to virtual interviews only to be ghosted. Although her only nonnegotiable thing is matching the salary from her last internship, more than 130 job applications have yielded nothing. She had to move back in with her parents.\n\n“Being able to share it on that app and having many different people talk about their experiences and relating to it,” Delinois said, “that is just so powerful.”",

  "text": "When the smoke of social media clears and the bright reds of Travis Kelce’s jersey and Taylor Swift’s lipstick have finally faded from your corneas, what’s left is this simple truth: Losing is more instructive to watch than winning. Maybe because losing is also more common to all of us. Mahomes’s stag-running opportunism was the fun part. But the more useful takeaway, for ordinaries like you and me, is how these people handle failure, and the public postgame judgments that come with it. Nobody handles it better than Shanahan, who has now lost fourth-quarter leads in our biggest game twice in five years.\n\nTo win on a really large scale, you have to be willing to suffer losing, and not just losing, but skin-blistering criticism, while not losing your own lights. That’s the lesson. And it’s the lesson that Andy Reid taught when Shanahan was still a coaching intern, long before he was successful enough to be questioned about why he chose to receive rather than kick in the overtime of the Super Bowl.\n\nShanahan is right where Reid once was. His 49ers have played in four NFC title games and two Super Bowls in the past five seasons and lost on most of those occasions. The experience is strikingly similar to Reid’s in Philadelphia from 2001 to 2005, when his Philadelphia Eagles played in four straight NFC championship games and lost Super Bowl XXXIX, to the New England Patriots and Tom Brady. Remember, Reid was considered a botcher of big games, an interesting and amiable builder of schemes but someone who just couldn’t manage the critical moments.\n\nEven the smartest and most knowledgeable commentators can be sucked into the short-term judgment game. The fabulous Tom Scocca, writing in Slate after Reid was let go by the Eagles for his supposed inability to make the right calls in the biggest games, concluded that Reid “was best understood as a powerful but slow football thinker — a coach with a rare gift for building sound, successful teams, but with no corresponding gift for rapid adjustment and decision-making.”\n\nWhat Reid has done right in Kansas City — mainly allowing his front office to draft and hand him the quarterbacking prodigy of a generation in Mahomes — is less intriguing to think about than his ability to withstand the verdicts of his critics about his decisional judgment. Reid was 61 before he won his first Super Bowl, and now he’s got three rings. What if he had listened to the “he blew it” narrative of others?\n\nThe truth is that there are “grays” in decision-making at the head of a complex organization under fast-shifting pressures. An NFL decider seldom gets pure justice or has full control over his fate, because competition is protean, it moves, and he relies so much on the actions of others. As J. K. Rowling once remarked, “Talent and intelligence never inoculated anyone against the caprice of the fates.” On Sunday, among the caprices and perplexities that Shanahan faced were: a punt that freakishly clipped the heel of his own player for a turnover that handed a touchdown to the Chiefs, and a rare blocked extra point by kicker Jake Moody that entirely changed the calculus, allowing Kansas City to tie the game on a field goal with three seconds left.\n\nWhat constitutes a good decision under pressure? The management expert Henry Mintzberg defined it as the ability to sort through “dynamic and shifting factors to make a specific commitment to action.” The vast majority of us make our right or wrong calls fairly invisibly, for relatively petty stakes. But professional coaches make their decisions in full public view with literally 100 million armchair second guessers judging them. And that factor itself can become a huge complexity — the temptation to please others can warp judgments. As Shanahan told his longtime friend Sean McVay in a fascinating conversation on the “Flying Coach” podcast, he is determined to be sure his play-calling “is not going to ever be based off of, ‘Yeah it’s probably a little risky to do this, I totally believe it’s right but I’m not going to do it based on perception-wise and this could get me blamed.’”\n\nMost of us are blind to the football-specifics that a Reid or Shanahan must manage. What’s most worth studying in them is not their technical judgments in those moments, but their broader leaderly resilience; they are able to move on with a self-rescuing composure. They ask, what was an avoidable error, and what is a reasonable failure? Where was the competitor simply better? They reject pat conclusions about pass plays that should have been runs and runs that should have been passes, of used or wasted timeouts and directional choices on coin flips. They have the fortitude to sort through causal events and accept losing with a coherent personal philosophy.\n\nHe has always said, “Only one team is happy at the end of the year.” The future winners are those who take the lessons from the losses — and do so without excessive self-recrimination.",

  "text": "Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on Tuesday announced more steps the department is taking to help colleges as it continues to try to smooth out kinks in the rollout of its revamped financial aid form. The changes, including a relaxing of some compliance requirements, come as members of Congress are stepping up calls for the department to do more to remedy problems with the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). But the plan does not address the problems some families are still facing in accessing the form.\n\nThe FAFSA is filled out by about 17 million students each year and serves as a gateway to billions of dollars in grants and scholarships from the federal government, states, foundations and colleges. A new version of the form was unveiled in late December, but its launch has been besieged by technical glitches, formula errors and delays that are making it difficult for students to figure out how much they will have to pay for college.\n\nColleges are in a bind as they wait for the department to send data from FAFSA applications. After originally promising the information starting in January, the Education Department said it will now take two months longer, in part, as it updates a formula used to help determine whether a student is eligible for aid. University leaders have complained that their financial aid offices are being asked to quickly churn out aid offers while meeting a host of regulatory requirements from the department.\n\nTo ease the burden, Cardona said, the department will reduce FAFSA verification, an audit widely considered an unnecessary hurdle for low-income students and a time-consuming task for aid offices. Now that the department is receiving the majority of income data directly from the Internal Revenue Service, the department anticipates there will be less of a need to verify a student’s information.\n\nThe department is also suspending through June new reviews to confirm a college is meeting requirements to receive federal student aid, except for those related to suspected fraud or a severe breach of fiduciary duties. In addition, the department said it will provide flexibility in the process for some colleges to recertify eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs.\n\n“These steps are a direct response to input we’ve received from financial aid administrators and college and university presidents about where they’re seeing challenges with implementing Better FAFSA and the concrete ways we can help them process this information easier and simpler,” Cardona said on a call with reporters Monday.\n\nThe measures are part of a broader effort that Cardona has described as the FAFSA College Support Strategy. Last week, the secretary said the department would use $50 million to create a helpline for colleges and send experts to some campuses to support financial aid offices. The department will also release test versions of the FAFSA data within the next two weeks, which will help schools prepare their systems to generate aid offers.\n\n“We applaud these initial measures from the Department,” Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said in a statement. “To make this work, higher education stakeholders require a sustained effort, which includes additional administrative relief and the Department meeting its FAFSA processing timelines going forward.”\n\nPressure is mounting for the Biden administration to quickly clean up the messy FAFSA launch. A group of more than 100 Democratic lawmakers wrote to Cardona on Monday, urging the secretary to address the operational problems. Lawmakers want clarity on how the department plans to communicate any further delays in processing the FAFSA and minimize the potential impact on students.\n\n“The recent announcements from the Department were a welcome first step in addressing the many challenges students, counselors, aid administrators, and relevant stakeholders are facing,” lawmakers wrote. “But now, it is imperative that we all work together to ensure no student falls through the cracks or faces unnecessary challenges in accessing the aid they are due.”\n\nWhile the department is taking steps to help colleges, it has yet to resolve more than a dozen technical errors preventing some families from completing the FAFSA. Chief among them is a glitch preventing parents without a Social Security number from being able to contribute information to the FAFSA and stopping their children who are U. S. citizens from applying for aid. On Monday, the department said officials are meeting daily to resolve the matter but could not provide a clear timeline. For now, families can submit a paper version of the FAFSA.\n\n“The reason students, parents, and schools are scrambling to deal with financial aid uncertainty is because of gross mismanagement by the Department. End of story,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N. C.), chairwoman of the House Education Committee.",

  "text": "Darren Baker and his dad don’t just share a love for baseball. They also have an appreciation for wildlife. The two spent time fishing together in South Florida during the last two spring trainings and also visited a turtle reserve, not too far from where they were staying. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news.But Darren’s dad, Dusty Baker, retired this past fall after four seasons as the Houston Astros manager. The baseball lifer stayed around the game, returning to the San Francisco Giants as an adviser. The Astros share a spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Fla., with the Washington Nationals, who are scheduled to have their first pitchers and catchers workout Wednesday. The Giants prepare for the coming MLB season in Arizona, though, which means Darren Baker’s third spring training with the Nationals will look slightly different.\n\n“I’ve definitely thought about it a lot,” Darren Baker said last month. “It happens a lot with parents. You maybe take something for granted and then it’s too late. And then it’s like, ‘Man, that was really nice.’ But yeah, it’s definitely gonna be weird.”\n\nThis isn’t the only change for the younger Baker.  The 24-year-old second baseman  is one of six prospects set to participate in their first big league camp. Baker spent last season with Class AAA Rochester; though he missed some time with a groin injury and rehabbed at lower levels. Now there’s a sense of urgency for Baker, who enters 2024 hoping to assert himself as a player who can help the Nationals compete in the future.\n\nBaker has typically gone to Houston during his offseasons to spend time with his dad for the Astros’ postseason runs before returning home to California to train. He went back home earlier than normal last fall, though, to maximize his offseason ahead of 2024.\n\n“I can feel like I’m getting closer,” he said. “Like to a dream, you know? I just know I can take it to another level.”\n\nThe offseason heading into 2023 was a lost one for Baker. He tore a ligament in his thumb sliding into a base in September 2022, but played through the rest of the season. He participated in the Arizona Fall League briefly, but ultimately he couldn’t move his hand without pain and opted for surgery.\n\nBaker ended his 2023 season hitting .284 with three home runs and 44 RBI. It was a solid year, but there’s certainly room for improvement. Power has never been a part of Baker’s game, yet he still only had 11 doubles in 107 games in 2023 after 24 in 105 games in 2022.  His slugging percentage (.349) was the same as his on-base percentage. Extra-base hits at the major league level will be even harder to come by.\n\nBaker also missed most of June with a groin injury that lingered into July. He played sparingly and admits that he came back too soon. But the desire to prove himself outweighed the fact that he didn’t feel 100 percent.\n\n“I just want something so bad,” said Baker, who grew up in big league clubhouses. “It’s hard not to see ahead a little bit sometimes.”\n\nBaker said he’s made his biggest jump in an offseason. He put on almost 15 pounds since leaving Rochester. Baker also hopes to display better plate discipline this year, including being “more stubborn” in swinging in his hot zones. Last season, he felt like pitchers at Class AAA exploited him on balls inside, resulting in him getting jammed on fastballs or chasing breaking pitches down and in.\n\nThe Nationals have Luis García at second base, though Manager Dave Martinez said García has to earn the job this spring. Jake Alu, Ildemaro Vargas and Rule 5 pick Nasim Nuñez are all utility options behind him. But that hasn’t stopped Baker from believing his opportunity could come soon.\n\nBaker still plans to continue some of his spring traditions, but not all of them.  That turtle reserve trip was more of a father-son outing, he says. And, of course, not living with his dad means fewer free meals. But Baker said his dad plans to make it out to Florida to watch him play.\n\n“He’ll be down there. I mean, he can’t stay away from it even if he wanted to,” Baker said. “My whole life literally, give or take a year or two, he’s been in the game. So I think he’ll really enjoy being able to see me.”",

  "text": "One hundred and sixty four people have been killed and another 200 wounded across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The overnight operation in Rafah, a place that has largely been spared the widespread aerial attacks experienced in other parts of the enclave, shocked a bone-tired population that has spent months on the move, trying to outrun the bombs.\n\nPalestinian families are packed into houses and tents in Rafah; some newer arrivals are sleeping in the streets. They are almost entirely dependent on humanitarian relief, as aid groups warn of a looming famine, and disconnected from loved ones in other parts of the Strip because cellular connections are patchy and there is no electricity to charge most phones.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants ambushed Israeli border communities from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage. More than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military campaign, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and much of the Strip has been has been flattened by airstrikes. Israeli authorities say Hamas is holding the bodies of about 30 people who died in captivity or who were killed on Oct. 7.\n\nAfter Biden and Netanyahu spoke Sunday for the first time in more than three weeks, a U. S. administration official said the American position on Rafah had been made “very clear.” The United States would not support such an operation unless Israel has a plan for civilian protection and sustenance “that was actually planned, prepared and implementable,” they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with White House rules.\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said he was “deeply concerned” by the reports from Rafah. “All wars have rules and the laws applicable to armed conflict cannot be interpreted so as to render them hollow or devoid of meaning,” he said in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nPalestinian families who have moved repeatedly say each displacement is harder than the last. Food and water are difficult to carry. Children who have brought their favorite toys with them become inconsolable when they are left behind in the chaos. Communications challenges make it nearly impossible to know what awaits them in other parts of the Strip.\n\nAbove all, there is the question of where to go. A humanitarian worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said his family of five was running out of options. They had fled their home in Khan Younis in early December; now, they were preparing to head back, despite frequent attacks on the city.\n\nHe said they would be joining two dozen other relatives in his family’s one-bedroom house by the sea. The last remaining route connecting southern, central and northern Gaza — known as al-Rasheed or Beach Road — remained open, he said, though for how long he did not know. During earlier forced evacuations, some IDF-designated routes led civilians into the line of fire. Israeli forces have also arrested an unknown number of people at checkpoints along evacuation routes.\n\nBefore the war, Gazans who fit certain criteria could pay several hundred dollars to an Egyptian company to coordinate their exit through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The price has now shot up to $5,000 per adult or more, well out of reach for most families in the impoverished enclave.\n\nEven for the few who can afford it, the process remains opaque and uncertain. On Monday, the Egyptian company Hala posted a notice on its website saying that it was temporarily not accepting new applicants because its wait list was too long.",

  "text": "The U. S. government isn’t sure exactly how many U.S. citizens are being held captive. After Friday’s release of the Raanans, 10 Americans remain unaccounted for. Not all of them are presumed to be hostages, one person said. Israel has not yet identified the remains of all the people killed in the initial Hamas assault.\n\nWhen asked by reporters on Friday whether Israel should delay its ground invasion of Gaza to allow time for more hostages to be freed, President Biden replied “yes,” an apparent break with the administration’s previous assertions that it would not dictate the timeline on which an attack should commence. The White House later said the president misheard the question and instead was affirming that he wanted more hostages released.\n\nBiden has maintained that securing the hostages’ release is his top priority. About a week after Hamas’s cross-border massacre, Biden spoke with the families of Americans presumed to be held hostage. He did the same on Wednesday, during his seven hours on the ground in Tel Aviv, this time consoling family members of Israeli hostages as well as victims of the attack.\n\nWhile Hamas led the Oct. 7 attack on the Israel-Gaza border, multiple militant groups are now holding hostages, three people who have been briefed on the negotiations said. That has exacerbated the difficulty facing U. S. and other officials directly involved in the process because it’s unclear which groups are holding which hostages, the people said.\n\nPart of the challenge is that, in Hamas’s accounting, after its members tore down the border fence between Gaza and Israel, militants affiliated with several groups rushed through, including members of Islamic Jihad, said a diplomat with insight on the negotiations. Hamas itself claims not to have a full picture of all of the hostages, where they are being held and who is holding them, the diplomat said.\n\nUnrelenting Israeli airstrikes on Gaza also are complicating negotiations and making it more difficult to assess where hostages are being held and whether they are alive, those familiar with the process said. Biden said Friday in his statement hailing the Raanans’ release that efforts to free hostages held by Hamas would continue, a potential sign the White House believes the group does possess additional Americans.\n\nSeparately, the Biden administration believes that about 500 Americans are trapped inside Gaza, not as hostages but because they were there when the Hamas attack occurred and have been unable to leave amid the Israeli military’s retaliation. U. S. officials are working to secure a safe passage out of Gaza for Americans via the Rafah border crossing into Egypt, but it had not yet opened as of Friday. That initiative depends on the cooperation of the Egyptian government, Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe person said that in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas assault, U. S. hostage specialists were highly skeptical about their chances of success. The mood changed for the better sometime around last weekend, the person said, declining to be more specific about what caused the shift.\n\nBut the situation remains tenuous. Blinken and his top aides have urged the Israelis to allow aid into Gaza, contemplate an end game strategy and work to limit civilian casualties, though they have refrained from asking them to delay their assault, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nOne U. S. official said it was clear that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not going to wait until the hostage crisis was resolved to initiate a ground offensive and that there was little Washington could do to change that calculus. The Israeli leader has continuously bucked U.S. demands during the Biden era and officials are loath to create a public spat as Republicans on Capitol Hill search for any sign of the president being insufficiently pro-Israel.\n\nThe U. S. government revamped the procedure through which it navigates international hostage negotiations less than a decade ago, after the families of Americans held hostage in Syria complained of being passed around among government agencies, none of whom seemed capable of communicating information about missing loved ones or coordinating America’s response.\n\n“We’re able to come up, maybe ahead of time, with almost our laundry list of things that we might be able to offer in order to break someone through,” Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, told an online audience earlier this year during a talk hosted by the International Spy Museum. Setting up a means to talk to the hostage-takers is critical, Carstens said, but the logistics of different scenarios can create significant obstacles.\n\n“Then you get into the problem of what kind of concessions you can give,” Carstens said. “If it’s a terrorist, there are certain things that we’re not allowed to throw onto the table. For instance, you would not want to put a bag of money on the table to a hostage group.”",

  "text": "A Miami journalist filed a federal complaint against his radio station this week, claiming that he and his team were let go after a series of discriminatory incidents, including a boss who allegedly said their show was “sounding very Latino.”Last week, South Florida’s WLRN terminated Carlos Frías and two producers on his team and canceled “Sundial,” a show about local arts and culture that aired since 2017 and has been replaced with an extra hour of nationally syndicated programming.\n\nThe shake-up has caused a wave of upset from the Florida Keys to Miami to Palm Beach — a region where Frías, who is Cuban American, has been a longtime voice in the cultural scene. Some South Florida groups have voiced their opposition to the sunsetting of “Sundial” — including one anchor who reportedly quit the radio station in solidarity with Frías.\n\nStation executives defended the cuts as a necessary trade-off. “The change was made to focus more resources on WLRN’s award-winning newsroom, mainly boosting news stories for daily newscasts and features, along with bolstering the expansion of digital stories,” WLRN’s vice president of news, Sergio Bustos, the station’s daily news and live programming director, Caitie Muñoz, and its vice president of radio, Peter Maerz, said in a statement.\n\nBut Frías, who joined as the show’s host in 2022, said the “Sundial” team was let go about a week after he complained to human resources about racial discrimination, according to a filing he made jointly to the Florida Commission on Human Relations and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday.\n\nFrías alleges that Muñoz told a producer that the show was “sounding very Latino” last August, and made a spreadsheet of the show’s guests that only listed the ethnicity for Hispanic or Latino guests. The producer declined a request for comment, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nThe show has featured several Hispanic and Latino guests, including Puerto Rican artists and Cuban American authors. But Amlong argued that that’s to be expected in an area where Spanish and Spanish-language media is also widespread.\n\nFrías added that when he asked for clarification about the spreadsheet’s ethnicity category, Maerz told him that “we had to be considerate of people’s ‘cultural comfort zones,’ which I understood to mean white people were being made uncomfortable by how diverse our show was (as is our Miami home).”\n\nThe former radio host said that multiple people had witnessed or experienced racial discrimination while working for the station. He said Bustos reprimanded him for “airing our dirty laundry” after the host shared on social media an email from a listener who complained of the “macho latin sensibility he subtly brings to the show most days.” Frías added that Bustos fired him, explaining that the company was “going in another direction.”\n\nLeslie Ovalle Atkinson, who was part of the laid-off “Sundial” team, said that while the cancellation came without warning, it was heartwarming to receive messages of support from listeners who held the show to high esteem.\n\n“The impact that ‘Sundial’ had too was that we could have these long-form, sit-down conversations with people in the community doing things that our community should know about,” Atkinson said. “Sometimes, the people that we showcase don’t often get that time on air.”\n\nWhen Frías joined WLRN, he brought along the large fan base and respect he had amassed among South Floridians as an award-winning food editor for the Miami Herald for six years. In 2022, he won the Jonathan Gold Local Voice Award at the James Beard Awards for his coverage at the newspaper.\n\nA Miami native and son of Cuban exiles, he’s also written about his heritage in his memoir, “Take Me with You: A Secret Search for Family in a Forbidden Cuba.” Frías has also been outspoken on the issue of gun violence since his father was shot and killed in 2020.\n\nIt’s too early to tell if the complaint will lead to a lawsuit or how involved the government will be in the dispute. Frías’s lawyers say they are waiting to hear WLRN’s side of the story. If the case ends up in court, the attorneys said they’d probably ask for Frías to get his job back with back pay, although it’s unclear if that’s what he wants.\n\n“I don’t know what’s next but I know this: I’ve dedicated my life to storytelling,” Frías wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. “I know that’s where my next project is. Not sure how or where. But it is my lighthouse.”",

  "text": "The account is run by Team Biden-Harris, the name for the reelection effort, and will be posting content regularly as it does on other social channels including Threads, Instagram, Facebook, X and Truth Social, according to campaign advisers.\n\n“Our Roman Empire is reaching voters wherever they are (did I do that right)?” said Rob Flaherty, deputy campaign manager for Biden’s reelection campaign. The phrase “Roman Empire” has become a meme that functions as shorthand for something a person cares deeply about and can’t stop thinking about.\n\nBiden’s team has leaned hard into memes in attempts to connect with young people. Biden’s avatar on TikTok features a black and white photo of the president with laser eyes, a style of image popularized by the “Dark Brandon” meme which portrays Biden as a no nonsense super hero schooled in the dark art of politics.\n\n“Young people around the country have been waiting for this moment,” said Aaron Parnas, a Gen Z political content creator. “The president is meeting us where we are, and we’ll help him with because of it.”\n\nBiden’s campaign said that they’re taking advanced safety precautions around their devices and incorporating a protocol to ensure security of the account. The campaign’s presence is independent from the ongoing review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government agency that’s tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns and has been negotiating with TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nThe White House has often used TikTok to spread messaging and has briefed TikTok creators on things such as the war in Ukraine, the president’s infrastructure initiatives, and the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, a group of TikTok creators spent an hour in the Oval Office in a private meeting with the president. The trip was organized by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in an attempt to leverage TikTok’s vast audience to influence the midterms. The DNC maintains an official TikTok account. Last December, the White House also hosted its first holiday party exclusively for content creators.\n\nTikTok has become a powerful tool for campaigning. In 2020, a collective of hundreds of content creators joined TikTok for Biden, a collaborative effort aimed at getting the president elected. And other lawmakers, such as Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), have made TikTok integral to their campaigning efforts. One of the most popular lawmakers on TikTok is Rep. Jeff Jackson (D-N. C.), who has amassed a following of over 2.5 million by posting regular videos about the top news.\n\n“Last election, there was still an open question: Could influencers move the needle on political campaigns?” Daniel Daks, founder of the talent management firm Palette, who helped organize the TikTok creators’ trip to Washington to meet Biden and former president Barack Obama, said last year. “It’s been answered pretty solidly with a yes.”\n\nLast year, The Washington Post reported that some Democrats worried the crackdown on TikTok could hurt the party’s ability to reach younger voters. “Ditching something that has proven to be incredibly helpful to winning elections is like shooting yourself in the foot,” said Aidan Kohn-Murphy, the founder of Gen-Z for Change, a coalition of creators formerly known as TikTok for Biden.\n\nHowever, more recently, many young TikTok creators have used the platform to be critical of Biden. They’ve railed against his policies on climate change, the war in Gaza and failure to contain the pandemic. Last year, many young activists attempted to leverage TikTok to get the Biden administration to stop the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. Their campaign was unsuccessful, however TikTok has remained a powerful political platform and hub for progressive activism.\n\nChristian Tom, director of the White House’s Office of Digital Strategy, told an audience of content creators and industry executives at VidCon Baltimore last year that, for the first time, there is a specific team at the White House dedicated to forging partnerships with content creators.\n\n“The work we do with creators has the most upside and potential of all the communications methods we employ,” Tom said. “Whether it’s spicy tweets from @WhiteHouse, or our work with creators, it’s about how we can find a way to appear in the feed in a way that feels authentic, organic and ultimately surprises you.”",

Here’s what it was like. This $3,499 headset is rough around the edges, but it made me optimistic about ‘spatial’ computingChris Velazco uses an Apple Vision Pro. (Carolyn Fong for The Washington Post) SAN FRANCISCO — I’ve fallen asleep watching movies on a Vision Pro, the $3,499 face computer Apple released earlier this month.I watched virtual planes land in Atlanta while listening to air traffic control, then edited a spreadsheet of addresses for wedding invites. I examined a roast through the headset’s cameras, and ate it without stabbing myself.Take it from me: Life inside this headset is equal parts mesmerizing and messy.When you get into the groove, using the Vision Pro can feel thrilling. But when things don’t work the way you expect — which in my case was pretty often — you may wonder why you didn’t just use the gadgets you already have.To see what “spatial computing” could really do for me, I wore the Vision Pro every day for two weeks. Here’s what you should know.Here's what you can and can't do Apple's new VisionProWhat it’s like to wear the headset for hoursComfort: I could wear the 1.3-pound Vision Pro for four or five hours before my neck needed a break, but I had to adjust the fit often. (And yes, taking it off is always a relief.) I never felt nauseous, and a colleague prone to motion sickness found the experience surprisingly bearable — but she still started feeling uneasy after 45 minutes.Navigation: When you open an app, it just floats wherever you stick it in the world around you, even if you walk away. Bring an app close to you, and you can interact with it the way you would on an iPad.But you’ll also have to get used to navigating with your eyes. For apps you’re not right next to, you can look right at them and put your thumb and index finger together to select something. I’ve watched total novices figure it out instantly — but there’s still a learning curve.Surrounding yourself with app windows can be helpful, but some may find it overwhelming. (Video: Chris Velazco/The Washington Post)Frequently, I’ve looked at some something I wanted to select and pinched my fingers, only for nothing to happen. I’ve “clicked” on the wrong thing because elements of an app or webpage were too close together. I’ve even flicked app windows someplace else completely, because I didn’t realize my fingers were touching before I moved my hand.“Spatial” computing: If the Vision Pro has one purpose, it’s to let you put the content and apps you want to use where you need them. You can have 9 or 10 apps running before the headset starts to struggle, and I’ve spent days trying apps in different places to see what feels useful. Surprisingly, those floating apps were most helpful when dealing with daily drudgery.I hand-wash dishes a lot, and it’s supremely tedious. But it’s less so when I have a YouTube video floating above my sink, one that I can interact with without drenching my phone or touching my ear buds.The Vision Pro's live video feed of the world around you is fast enough to cook with. (Video: Chris Velazco/The Washington Post)I also always forget about clothes in the dryer. Now, when, I do a load of laundry, I can hang a virtual timer in my hallway as a visual reminder.And on short afternoon workouts, I kept Slack and my email floating off to my side while (slowly) riding a stationary bike. By spinning a small dial (the “Digital Crown”), I could replace my apartment with a craggy Hawaiian landscape, complete with the sound of a lonely wind. I didn’t even need to reach for another device when someone needed me; I just pulled the app window over with a pinch and went to work.Silly? Maybe — but now that I’ve tried these things, I really want to keep doing them.In theory, the Vision Pro can be a portable, private office — just strap in, arrange your work apps, and get to it.I tried this for a few hours each day, and it’s definitely doable. It helps to pair a Bluetooth keyboard and one of Apple’s trackpads to the headset, since using the built-in virtual keyboard is a chore.But to get work done fast, I had to lean on the headset’s Virtual Desktop mode, which connects to a nearby Mac and turns its screen into a virtual window you can resize and stick where you like. When I’m editing my photos or tediously formatting all those wedding invite addresses, a big-screen version of my computer surrounded by vast, virtual environments is tough to beat.On Feb. 2, Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset went on sale. Help Desk reporter Chris Velazco tried the thing to see if it's worth the hype and the money. (Video: Monica Rodman/The Washington Post)But even this comes with quirks. If you have an Apple laptop,  you just have to look at it — a “Connect” button will appear over the computer. But if you use something like a Mac Mini, or a closed MacBook hooked up to a monitor, the Vision Pro may struggle to find it. (As I sat down to write this article, it took three tries to get the Virtual Desktop working.)The headset’s super-sharp screens also mean it’s wonderful for just watching things. I missed “Oppenheimer” in Imax earlier this year, but cuing it up on a virtual screen as big as my living room wasn’t a bad alternative. And the sound coming from a set of lump-like speakers was so good that I mostly left my ear buds behind.You’ll also want to keep the Vision Pro’s battery pack plugged in during longer movies; I generally got between two and three hours of use from a single charge.These are, arguably, what the Vision Pro is best at right now. The Vision Pro’s App Store could change that in time; for now it’s a funky a blend of the practical (like Microsoft’s Office apps), the gimmicky (like “Day,” which lets you spin VR turntables), and the odd-yet-earnest (like “Xaia,” an immersive AI therapy tool.)Apple’s new Vision Pro is a privacy mess waiting to happenPeople treat you a little differently when you’re wearing a Vision Pro.Sure, you can see them almost normally through the headset’s cameras. I say “almost” because you’ll see that video feed blur a little while moving your head. (Be careful walking over to them, too, since the headset blocks your peripheral vision.)But assuming you’re looking right at someone, they may be peering back at a set of hazy digital eyes on the headset’s outer screen. Those “eyes” are powered by the Vision Pro’s still-in-beta “Personas,” your virtual stand-for FaceTime video calls or Zoom meetings.My traveling fiancée was happy to cut our nightly FaceTime calls short after seeing it.I was nearly ready to write my Persona off until a friend with a Vision Pro FaceTimed me to catch up. The first half-hour of looking at his faux-face was unnerving. But as the conversation stretched into an hour, and then another, the weirdness had evaporated — it just felt like I was looking at my friend, not some weird facsimile. And he felt the same way.You can, and probably will, get used to these things. The real question is how fast, and who may avoid you until they get used to it, too.Unfortunately, the Vision Pro also has a sharing problem.A Guest User mode lets your friends see what the fuss is about, but two out of three people I’ve tried it with struggled to get through the setup process. (One person put the headset on four times before it even recognized it wasn’t looking at me.)And no support for multiple users means communal use at home isn’t possible the way it is with a Mac or iPad.Thankfully, there’s at least one way the Vision Pro can make you feel more connected to others: You can use it to view immersive  videos captured with an iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max, or another Vision Pro. (Don’t worry: You can watch them as normal 2D videos on an iPhone.) They don’t always feel lifelike, but when scenes were captured just right, I felt present — and a little less alone — in moments and with people who weren’t really there.You probably know you don’t need this right now. It’s bulky, expensive and very much a first-generation product. But it’s also a glimpse at a new way of living with technology; one I think a lot of people could find helpful if they get past some inherent weirdness.You might want to try it by scheduling a demo at an Apple Store. Better to lose 25 minutes than thousands of dollars.After these two weeks, I’m sold on what the Vision Pro can do. I want to keep app windows around me in just the right places, shut out the world sometimes when I need some alone time, and pop back in when I’m ready. I just don’t want to wear a hefty headset on my face to be able to do these things, or shell out at least $3,499 for it.Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

  "text": "Open radio access networks, or Open RAN, is an emerging technology for cell towers that allows for the use of mix-and-match parts from different vendors — a little akin to Google’s Android ecosystem. This diverges from the Apple-esque, proprietary, all-in-one systems from Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia that dominate the market. U. S. officials hope that this new initiative will help U.S. vendors get back in a game they were largely squeezed out of during two decades of globalization.\n\nOpen RAN technology originated as an internationalized concept with no special U. S. ties in the late 2010s, with companies like AT&T and China Mobile working together on it. Then the Trump administration began promoting the nascent technology, considering it advantageous for smaller U.S. players, in what some scholars have described as a “geopolitical hijacking.” The Biden administration has intensified the Open RAN push as the technology has become more ready for the market.\n\nTelecommunications gear has loomed large in these deliberations, due to its obvious utility for intelligence agencies in signals intelligence-gathering in peacetime, and the risk of a disastrous cutoff of communications by an adversary in the case of a war. After decades of globalization and industry consolidation, more than half the global supply of these “pipes” come from only four vendors: China’s Huawei and ZTE, and Scandinavia’s Ericsson and Nokia. After many of the earlier U. S. heavyweights died out, U.S. contenders remaining in this space include Mavenir, Airspan and Radisys.\n\n“If you had the choice to buy a solution from one supplier, and he had the responsibility for the end-to-end solution, why should you buy solutions from four different suppliers and then end up in a situation where if something goes wrong, you don’t know about supplier A, B and C’s responsibility?” Strand said. “That’s what the operators are saying. That’s the reason why they’re not buying.”",

  "text": "Israel’s military said Marman and Har were both in “good medical condition.” They were transported via military helicopters to Sheba Tel Hashomer Medical Center in Israel, where the medical staff said their condition was “stable” and where they were reunited with their families.\n\n“I salute our brave warriors for the bold action that led to their liberation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. “Only the continuation of military pressure until complete victory will result in the release of all our abductees. We will not miss any opportunity to bring them home.”\n\nArmed Hamas militants were guarding the men and were also spread throughout the building, he said. A minute later, he said, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes; Israeli soldiers shielded the hostages with their bodies as other troops exchanged heavy fire with Hamas fighters.\n\nNetanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were with Israel’s military chief as the raid unfolded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting, the military said. In a visit Monday with the unit that carried out the operation, Netanyahu called it “one of the most successful rescue raids in the history of Israel. … A perfect operation that was perfectly executed.”\n\nIt was only the second successful rescue mission since the start of the ground incursion into Gaza in late October — on Oct. 30, the IDF rescued a female hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, in addition to 29 others who are believed to be dead, most of them killed during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMany of the families of the hostages and the thousands of Israelis who have joined them in street protests have called on the government to agree to a deal with Hamas to exchange hostages for prisoners, believing it is the only way to guarantee the safety of their loved ones and questioning whether military operations are a realistic strategy on a larger scale.\n\n“We commend the IDF soldiers who demonstrated strength and bravery to secure the release of the two hostages, and wish them all to return home safely and speedily,” said a statement Monday by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing most of the families.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei lauded the rescue operation Monday morning and said in a social media post that in a meeting with Netanyahu last week in Jerusalem, he requested “the release of every one of the Argentine hostages” and continued to “maintain his condemnation of Hamas terrorism.”\n\nThe operation came hours after Netanyahu spoke on the phone with President Biden, who warned that an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah without appropriate accommodations for the civilian population would be seen as unacceptable to the United States, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nOn Monday, it remained unclear how the rescue — lasting about an hour and limited in its scope — would affect Israel’s broader plans for a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, where it says Hamas’s top leaders are hiding, using the remaining hostages as shields.\n\nEgypt has reinforced its border, signaling that it would not accept an exodus of refugees fleeing the fighting. It has warned that an Israeli invasion of the area along its border could endanger the countries’ 1979 peace treaty that has for decades stabilized the region.\n\nThe rescue operation was carried out amid negotiations to return the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as a halt in the fighting. Senior American, Egyptian and Qatari officials are expected to convene in Cairo on Tuesday; it is still unclear if Israel will send a delegation.\n\nDavid Tsur, former head of Yamam, the special counterterrorism unit that was among the agencies involved in the overnight mission, said that because the talks have been so far unsuccessful, the Israeli army took advantage of the “very short window of opportunity” to free the hostages. But he said it will have consequences for future operations.",

  "text": "Here’s an unromantic question for Valentine’s Day: Can we live without roses? Yes, they are the most popular cut flower around the world, and that’s no wonder; the blooms are stunning. But the daily, nonstop, global race to get just-cut roses from greenhouses to your front door makes them punishing on the environment. Which means it’s time to think differently.\n\nThis fast-moving game of romantic commerce never stops. It’s also absurd: The race required to provide a mass-produced bit of nature — at any hour, in any place, for as little as $10 a dozen — contributes significantly to the destruction of nature itself.\n\nAirliners filled with flowers zip around the globe every day. Chrysanthemums from Colombia dash to Japan; roses from Kenya end up in Britain; carnations from Ecuador jet to Russia. Nearly all imported cut flowers go through the same emissions-intensive journey — climate-controlled greenhouses, refrigerated trucks and a long, chilled flight. Fresh flowers are a $34 billion global industry with a massive carbon footprint.\n\nCompared with other perishables we transport around the world, flowers are perhaps the most damaging to the climate. The reason? Nearly everything else moves by ship, which has 1 percent the carbon footprint of air freight. A 2020 analysis of products sold in British grocery stores, by climate expert Mike Berners-Lee, found that a bouquet of imported flowers has a more significant impact than an 8-ounce steak raised on deforested land in Brazil and consumed in London.\n\nFor those who adore flowers, like my mom, this might come as a shock. She expressed concern when I told her about the supply chain. “I see the harm,” she said. “But … they’re so beautiful.”\n\nI feel it, too. Flowers play both real and symbolic roles in our lives. They express emotion in a way few things can: sympathy, love, regret, reverence — or just a simple gesture of care.\n\nWe don’t need to give that up.\n\nThere’s plenty the industry can do to reduce its climate impact. Greenhouses should be warmed by renewable energy, which should get easier as countries diversify their energy sources. This is particularly important in the Netherlands, the world’s largest exporter of cut flowers. In that country, with its cloudy, northern climate, highly automated and energy-intensive greenhouses are the norm, the majority of which are powered by fossil fuels. Recently, the Dutch government and the horticulture sector agreed to reduce emissions from these greenhouses. It can’t be an idle commitment.\n\nMost importantly, the sector needs to move away from air freight. Some companies are already experimenting with shipping flowers by sea, an option with substantially fewer emissions. By carefully controlling the atmosphere in the containers, it is possible for cut stems to remain dormant for weeks. Most Western governments have yet to require individual industries to reduce their reliance on air freight, but if lawmakers start issuing those orders, the cut-flower industry should be among the first to be regulated.\n\nConsumers can help, too. Avoid roses, carnations and chrysanthemums, the three species that make up the vast majority of imported flowers. The environmental impact of a bouquet plummets when the flowers are grown locally and are in season.\n\nHardy and with a long vase life, the big three species are perfect for cheap mass production and quick delivery around the world. Their success as a globally produced export means American growers can’t compete. Instead, farmers in the United States primarily cultivate specialty flowers such as sunflowers, dahlias, zinnias and snapdragons. They are more delicate and don’t travel well over long distances.\n\nSo, buy those flowers with the less-common names. They are grown chiefly in California, but small farms also cultivate them across the country. It’s no guarantee, but it’s significantly less likely they arrived via air.\n\nAnother thing consumers can do is to look for the “Certified American Grown” label when buying flowers at the supermarket. This guarantees the blooms were cultivated in the United States. Or better yet? Avoid buying flowers at grocery chains altogether. Instead, request sustainable bouquets from a local florist. Another way to ensure blooms were grown nearby is to purchase them at a local farmers market.\n\nUltimately, the environmental harms from the flower industry stem from our desire for cheap and instant gratification — and the brutally efficient willingness of private industry to produce it. The well-being of people and the planet comes second, if at all.\n\nConfronting this requires re-examining our priorities. Yes, a fresh bouquet means instant beauty; it is more sustainable to plant a few tulips or daylilies, or some phlox or daffodils, and they’ll come back every year. Buy favorite flowers only when they’re in season and get to know what is locally available at different times of the calendar. Loosen the compulsion for rock-bottom prices: Pay more for something grown closer. And give up cultural expectations: Romance doesn’t need to be limited to roses.\n\nBecause when our effort to bring the beauty of nature indoors is harmful to that beauty itself, it begs that we question the absurdity of our way of life.",

  "text": "“The major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan to ensure the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there,” Biden said, referring to Israel’s publicly announced plans to invade the city. “Many people there have been displaced — displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north. And now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable. They need to be protected.”\n\nAbdullah was more direct. “We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to create another humanitarian catastrophe,” the king said. Referring to the war more broadly, he added: “We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end.\"\n\nThe joint comments by the president and the king Monday came after Biden met privately with Abdullah at the White House, the first face-to-face discussion the president has held with an Arab leader since the Israel-Gaza war began in October. The meeting came as U. S. officials have expressed deep concern about Israel’s plans to target the tiny town of Rafah, which borders Egypt and where about 1.3 million Palestinians are living in decrepit conditions after fleeing there under Israeli orders.\n\nDespite Biden’s growing willingness to publicly challenge Israel’s conduct of the war, he and his top aides have not publicly supported restricting aid to Israel or imposing conditions on it, as many of the president’s liberal critics demand. And while National Security Council spokesman John Kirby last week said an Israeli operation in Rafah “would be a disaster for those people, and we would not support it,” the White House has not threatened specific consequences if Israel proceeds with its plans.\n\nAn Israeli operation overnight Sunday in Rafah succeeded in rescuing two hostages, but it also killed at least 67 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, raising fears among Arab leaders that a sustained Israeli operation there could kill and injure thousands more. The planned Rafah operation has also escalated fears of a forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians, as Arab leaders fear they will be pushed into Egypt — a goal that far-right cabinet members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have openly embraced.\n\nAt a time when Biden has faced increasing criticism from Arab-American and Muslim voters angry over his staunch support for Israel and what they describe as a lack of empathy for Palestinians, Biden found a welcome ally in Abdullah. The president took the opportunity to highlight the suffering of the Palestinians, saying they are facing “unimaginable pain” and adding, “It’s heartbreaking. Every innocent life [lost] in Gaza is a tragedy, just as every innocent life lost in Israel is a tragedy as well.”\n\nJordan, whose population includes a large proportion of ethnic Palestinians, will almost certainly be key to any long-term American vision for the Middle East. Biden has said the war in Gaza must be followed by planning for a Palestinian state — a notion forcefully rejected by Netanyahu — and the United States believes that will require a thorough reform of the Palestinian Authority, which governs part of the West Bank. Jordan, which borders both Israel and the West Bank, would be central to any such effort.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has shown more willingness to take aim at the Israeli military operation in Gaza, last week calling it “over the top,” his strongest rebuke to date. But for months, Arab leaders in the United States and the Middle East have felt Biden’s public comments allowed little room for criticism of the hard-hitting military campaign.\n\nIsrael since then has mounted a fierce retaliatory campaign in Gaza, killing more than 28,000 Palestinians so far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. In addition, more than 80 percent of the territory’s residents have been displaced, and an Israeli siege has put hundreds of thousands of residents at risk of famine and disease.\n\nBiden and Abdullah have known each other for more than 20 years and have deep affection for each other, according to aides to both men. As vice president, Biden oversaw the Iraq portfolio for the Obama administration and made more than a dozen trips to the country. On each of those trips – either on the way over or the way back home – Biden stopped in Amman to visit Abdullah, Riedel said.\n\n“Abdullah can talk about all these issues in a level of candor that few other Arab leaders can because he knows Biden – they’ve been around together for a long time,” Riedel said. “I think he can be much more direct and candid. Part of the king’s objective here is to appeal to the empathetic part of Joe Biden and get him to show some empathy with the Palestinian people, which Biden needs to do for his own domestic political reasons.”\n\nThe conflagration in the Middle East, which has already spread to engage several Iran-backed militias in the region, carries the risk of significant political consequences for Biden. Arab Americans in Michigan and elsewhere are organizing to defeat him, and polls suggest that younger voters and people of color are deeply unhappy with his handling of the war.\n\nAbdullah’s trip to Washington is part of a tour to visit the United States, Canada, France and Germany, part of his effort to mobilize international support for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as well as the protection of civilians and for more humanitarian aid. Abdullah is also expected on Tuesday to meet senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as members of Congress.",

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday. Former president Donald Trump’s latest rhetorical grenade shook the West’s preeminent military alliance. Over the weekend, he said he would encourage Russia to attack U.S. allies in NATO if they failed to invest enough on their national defense. The remarks, as well as separate comments about ending U.S. aid to foreign countries, “set off fresh tremors across Washington and in European countries already worried about America’s reliability as an ally in a potential second Trump administration,” my colleagues reported.\n\nTrump has long grumbled about the United States’ outsize role in NATO and casts President Biden’s support for Ukraine’s struggle to resist Russian invasion as a costly drag on the U. S. taxpayer. The sentiment has captured a segment of the Republican Party, which has blocked the Biden administration’s attempts to earmark some $61 billion in fresh funding for Ukraine.\n\nTo European onlookers, Trump’s stated hostility is a line in the sand. “Everyone should watch this video from Trump and then understand that Europe may soon have no choice but to defend itself,” Norbert Röttgen, a senior German lawmaker and former chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German parliament, wrote on his Facebook page. “We have to manage this because anything else would be surrender and self-abandonment!”\n\nTrump, in the eyes of some European critics, is an existential threat to the Western alliance and its political ethos. “The current presidential campaign only confirms that he has not changed his reckless attitude towards allies,” Marko Mihkelson, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Estonian Parliament, told my colleagues. “Unfortunately, he is therefore a very convenient tool for Putin’s Russia, which is waging war against the West.”\n\n“Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U. S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n\nDuring his term, Biden reinvigorated the transatlantic alliance, assuring European counterparts about U. S. commitments to their security while coordinating a robust, collective effort to support Kyiv. European diplomats in Washington barely disguise their confidence and trust in the Biden administration, and their apprehensions of what may come should Trump defeat him in November.\n\nBut on the other key battlefront in the global conversation, Biden has unsettled myriad political elites with his perceived complicity in Israel’s relentless war against Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli campaign, which has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, many of whom were children, took another deadly turn Monday with the expansion of operations in Rafah, a southern city along the territory’s border with Egypt that’s now hosting more than a million cornered Gazan refugees.\n\nBiden is reportedly frustrated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s uncompromising approach to the conflict. But has resisted internal pressure from aides and Democratic allies to do more to restrain the Israeli campaign — which came after militant group Hamas’s invasion on southern Israel on Oct. 7 — let alone condition future military aid to the Jewish state.\n\n“Biden, who aides say has a visceral attachment to the Jewish state, has tended to view the prime minister and the state of Israel as one and the same, according to several people familiar with his thinking, and has struggled with the idea of criticizing a sitting prime minister, particularly during a time of war,” my colleagues reported.\n\nEven Europe’s top diplomat offered a thinly veiled rebuke of Biden’s muddled stance. “How many times have you heard the most prominent leaders and foreign ministers around the world saying too many people are being killed?” E. U. foreign policy Josep Borrell told reporters Monday, gesturing to Biden’s recent remarks that Israel’s conduct of the war was “over the top.”\n\n“If the international community believes that this is a slaughter, that too many people are being killed, maybe we have to think about the provision of arms,” Borrell added.\n\nBut Biden and many of his European counterparts have largely ignored calls from protesters and some lawmakers in their own countries to force a cease-fire or take action to thwart Israel’s latest offensive in Rafah. Also unheeded was an injunction from the International Court of Justice, the U. N.'s highest court, requiring Israel to take steps to better protect civilian life in Gaza. Some U.N. officials already believe Israel is in breach of those demands.\n\nAccording to a U. N. commission, one in every 100 people in Gaza was killed in the first 100 days of the war, a rate higher than any other armed conflict in the 21st century. “The ongoing war stands out as unprecedented in the scale of death, destruction, and suffering, with repercussions that will echo for generations to come,” noted the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.\n\nThe toll of the conflict has turned public opinion against Israel in much of the world. It has also sparked fury at Israel’s perceived Western enablers, chiefly the United States, for their selective approach to the “rules-based international order.” Biden has anchored this concept at the heart of why he claims the United States must defend Ukraine, arguing that Putin cannot be allowed to show that might makes right.\n\n“The Arab and Muslim world has lost faith in perceived Western norms: international law and institutions, human rights, and democratic values,” wrote Mohamed ElBaradei, former Egyptian diplomat and former head of the U. N.'s atomic agency, in a column last month. “In their view, the West itself is showing that brute force trumps all else.”\n\nThe stakes are arguably as high, perhaps higher, than what Europe is weighing when it comes to its future collective security. If the rules-based international order “publicly fails once again,” suggested Renad Mansour of Britain’s Chatham House think tank, “by proving incapable of agreeing an end to the unprecedented bloodshed in Gaza, it will further undermine the world’s faith in the institutions that were built to serve it, and possibly contribute to its complete unraveling. Western leaders should think very hard about this historic moment and what might come next.”",

  "text": "Beset by devastating floods, Venice erected an engineering marvel of metallic barricades that can rise and lower in its inlets to protect the palazzos, piazzas and churches. Now, responding to residents’ fears that Venice is becoming a glorified water park, this lagoon city that has drawn awestruck visitors since the Middle Ages is seeking to become a laboratory for how to deal with a modern ill: tourists inundating Instagrammable destinations from Savannah, Ga., to Hallstatt, Austria.\n\nA 29-day test, set to start on April 25 after a series of delays, will require day-trippers to book and pay admission to set foot on Venice’s core island. City officials note that tourists worldwide have long paid entry fees for museums, archaeological sites, even churches, with more-popular sites turning to visitor caps or time slots. This system, they say, is a mild version of those.\n\nIf deemed a success, the new fees — initially set at 5 euros, equal to $5.38 — would continue to apply on certain days, officials say, especially in high season, when tourists can outnumber locals by 3 to 1. Overnight visitors, who already pay a tourist tax at hotels, would be exempt.\n\nAnother experimental measure, starting in August, will limit tour groups to 25 people. That follows a cruise ship ban in place since 2021 that prevents massive ships from sailing past St. Mark’s Square through the Giudecca Canal and docking at the historic city center — though they can still make port nearby. Venice has also banned new souvenir shops on the city’s main arteries, and new hotels now require an official vote in city hall.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, video feeds coming into an observation center at police headquarters showed tourists threading through narrow alleys. A network of cameras and sensors helps alert police to overcrowding. In three screen-filled rooms, officers can count the number of tourists in different areas and even assess where they might be from by analyzing the origins of their cellphone accounts.\n\nThe number of overnight visitors hit an all-time high of more than 3.5 million last year. Day-trippers — who spend far fewer euros — number an estimated 10 million annually, although that could include people who visit more than once. Meanwhile, the year-round population of Venice’s core island has fallen to fewer than 50,000 people — below the total number of beds in hotels and short-term rentals.\n\nAlthough the pandemic’s halt to global tourism dented wallets here, it also provided Venetians with a dreamy glimpse of a world in which their city was once again their own. Last year, as visitor numbers bounced back, the city also received a wake-up call. UNESCO experts recommended that Venice be added to a “List of World Heritage in Danger” — a potential PR nightmare for the mayor’s office. Among the reasons: the city’s inability to control mass tourism.\n\n“But that’s not to say they’re off the hook,” said Peter Debrine, a senior project officer with UNESCO, the arts, culture and sciences body of United Nations. “I think the committee wants to see how these efforts go.”\n\nPreservationists describe the fee for day-trippers as too little too late, noting that the 5-euro price of admission is less than the cost of a cappuccino on St. Mark’s Square. They call it political theater, designed to give the impression of curbing visitors, and thus appease UNESCO, without offending the powerful business lobbies in Venice that live and die on tourism.\n\nA genuine effort, they say, would involve far steeper pricing or outright caps, and see Venice follow in the footsteps of Florence and other cities in Europe and the United States that have sought to limit short-term rentals on platforms such as Airbnb.\n\nOfficials say they are trying to make major events like Carnival less oppressive for locals, reinventing it since the pandemic, for instance, as a more “diffused” celebration. More shows are now been held away from the main stage. To reduce crowds in St. Mark’s Square, organizers have also done away with the Flight of the Angel, a spectacle with roots in the 16th century in which an elaborately outfitted performer zip-lined from the Bell Tower.\n\nVenice’s Carnival, a celebration of transgression and vice performed with the aid of masks, dates to the Middle Ages. Though meant to be a great equalizer for rich and poor, it became an attraction for royals and aristocrats across Europe, tempting the city early on with the power of tourist coin. After a long dormancy, locals rekindled the tradition in late 1970s and early 1980s, then watched its transformation into the highly commercial event — and international draw — it is today.",

  "text": "Hamas, the Gaza-based Palestinian militant organization that led the attack, has historically maintained a degree of independence from Tehran compared with true Iranian proxy groups such as the Lebanese-based Hezbollah. But in recent years, Hamas has benefited from massive infusions of Iranian cash as well as technical help for manufacturing rockets and drones with advanced guidance systems, in addition to training in military tactics — some of which occurred in camps outside Gaza, the officials said.\n\nU. S. and Israeli officials said they have no firm evidence so far that Iran authorized or directly coordinated the attack that killed more than 900 Israelis and wounded thousands. But current and former intelligence officials said the assault bore hallmarks of Iranian support, and noted officials in Tehran have boasted publicly about the huge sums in military aid provided to Hamas in recent years.\n\n“If you train people on how to use weapons, you expect them to eventually use them,” said a Western intelligence official who, like others interviewed, requested that his name and nationality be withheld to freely discuss the rapidly unfolding events in southern Israel. The official, and a second Western analyst with access to sensitive intelligence, said the analysis conducted in the wake of the attack pointed to many months of preparation by Hamas, beginning at least as early as mid-2022.\n\nIn interviews, more than a dozen intelligence analysts and military experts expressed astonishment at the stealth and sophistication of the Hamas assault, which involved coordinated raids across the Israeli border by hundreds of gunmen traveling by land, sea and air — including motorized paragliders. The ground offensive was accompanied by swarms of rockets and drones that began streaking across the border early Saturday, hitting targets with a degree of precision not seen in previous Hamas attacks. While the Palestinian group has a capable militia and indigenous assembly lines for rockets and drones, an attack of Saturday’s scale would have been extremely challenging without considerable outside help, analysts said.\n\n“The amount of training, logistics, communication, personnel, and weapons required provides a massive footprint,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA senior operations officer who served in counterterrorism roles in the Middle East. “This suggests both Iranian involvement, given the complexity of the attack, and highlights the colossal intelligence failure.” The use of paragliders — reminiscent of a spectacular 1987 attack by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Israel that killed several soldiers — “surely required training outside of Gaza,” Polymeropoulos said.\n\nJonathan Finer, the White House’s deputy national security adviser, said in an interview with CBS News: “What I can say without a doubt is that Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks. Iran has been Hamas’s primary backer for decades. They have provided them weapons. They have provided them training. They have provided them financial support. And so, in terms of broad complicity, we are very clear about a role for Iran.”\n\nIran denied a direct role in Saturday’s attack, while also praising the Hamas militants who carried it out. “We are not involved in Palestine’s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself,” Tehran’s mission to the United Nations said in a statement released Monday. But other Iranian officials publicly celebrated the attack while highlighting their close relationship with Hamas.\n\nCurrent and former intelligence officials confirmed that Iran had provided technical help to Hamas in manufacturing the more than 4,000 rockets and armed drones launched into Israel since Saturday. At least some Hamas militants also have undergone training in advanced military tactics, including at Lebanese camps staffed by technical advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the officials said.\n\n“It’s a ‘train the trainer’ approach,” Knights said. “You don’t have to do a lot to train someone to be capable of operating a drone system, which is not complicated stuff anymore.” On the other hand, he said, the combined-arms breaching capability exhibited during Saturday’s assault “clearly was practiced and carefully planned somewhere. A whole bunch of fortified positions fell to sophisticated combined arms-breaching attacks. And you don’t just wing that.”\n\nMichael Eisenstadt, director of the Washington Institute’s Military and Security Studies Program, said that the relationship with Iran developed as a result of the Oslo peace process in the early 1990s when Tehran was looking for ways to scuttle efforts to forge a peace deal between the Palestinians and Israel. That was when Iran first provided the know-how for the explosive belts used by Palestinian suicide bombers.\n\nThe suicide bombing campaigns by both Hamas and Islamic Jihad had a “significant impact” on the peace process, he said. Hamas launched its first homemade rocket, the Qassam, in 2001 during the second intifada. But it was very rudimentary, using pipes and a homemade fuel mixture derived from sugar and other common components.\n\n“Iran over the years has provided a lot of assistance to Hamas in terms of rocket capability,” Eisenstadt said. “The signature weapon of Iran proxies are rockets, and increasingly missiles. You see that everywhere — with Iraq, Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah. That’s very much inspired by Iranian example and advice.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nTesla worker killed in fiery crash may be first ‘Full Self-Driving’ fatalityEvidence suggests the advanced driver-assistance system was engaged during a fatal crash that killed recruiter Hans von Ohain in 2022Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. The following footage obtained by The Washington Post shows Colorado authorities responding to a car crash on May 16, 2022, in Evergreen, Colo.This story is best experienced with sound.Hans von Ohain and Erik Rossiter were on their way to play golf one afternoon in 2022 when von Ohain’s Tesla suddenly swerved off Upper Bear Creek Road. The car’s driver-assistance software, Full Self-Driving, was struggling to navigate the mountain curves, forcing von Ohain repeatedly to yank it back on course.“The first time it happened, I was like, ‘Is that normal?’” recalled Rossiter, who described the five-mile drive on the outskirts of Denver as “uncomfortable.” “And he was like, ‘Yeah, that happens every now and then.’”Hours later, on the way home, the Tesla Model 3 barreled into a tree and exploded in flames, killing von Ohain, a Tesla employee and devoted fan of CEO Elon Musk. Rossiter, who survived the crash, told emergency responders that von Ohain was using an “auto-drive feature on the Tesla” that “just ran straight off the road,” according to a 911 dispatch recording obtained by The Washington Post. In a recent interview, Rossiter said he believes that von Ohain was using Full Self-Driving, which — if true — would make his death the first known fatality involving Tesla’s most advanced driver-assistance technology.Tesla owners have long complained of occasionally erratic behavior by the cars’ software, including sudden braking, missed road markings and crashes with parked emergency vehicles. Since federal regulators began requiring automakers to report crashes involving driver-assistance systems in 2021, they have logged more than 900 in Teslas, including at least 40 that resulted in serious or fatal injuries, according to a Post analysis.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselHow The Post determined Full Self-Driving likely was engagedThe crash appears in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s database of crashes reported to involve driver assistance software. Tesla reported the crash to NHTSA after receiving a complaint from an unspecified source.A purchase order obtained by The Post shows the car was equipped with Full Self-Driving, and the driver’s widow said he used it frequently, especially on the road where the crash occurred.A passenger who survived the crash said the driver used Full Self-Driving earlier in the day, and that he believes the feature was engaged at the time of the crash.According to 911 dispatch audio obtained by The Post, the survivor told emergency responders that an “auto-drive” feature had been in use. A state police investigator told The Post that crash dynamics were consistent with the feature’s use.Most involved Autopilot, which is designed for use on controlled-access highways. No fatal crash has been definitively linked to the more sophisticated Full Self-Driving, which is programmed to guide the car almost anywhere, from quiet suburban roads to busy city streets.Two years ago, a Tesla shareholder tweeted that there “has not been one accident or injury” involving Full Self-Driving, to which Musk responded: “Correct.” But if that was accurate at the time, it no longer appears to be so. A Tesla driver who caused an eight-car pileup with multiple injuries on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in 2022 told police he was using Full Self-Driving. And The Post has linked the technology to at least two serious crashes, including the one that killed von Ohain.Von Ohain and Rossiter had been drinking, and an autopsy found that von Ohain died with a blood alcohol level of 0.26 — more than three times the legal limit — a level of intoxication that would have hampered his ability to maintain control of the car, experts said. Still, an investigation by the Colorado State Patrol went beyond drunken driving, seeking to understand what role the Tesla software may have played in the crash.“Next thing I remember is waking up in the vehicle.”The question is critical as automakers race toward the promise of a driverless future. For private vehicles, that day is far from here. But critics say features like Full Self-Driving already are giving drivers a false sense of confidence about taking their eyes off the road — or getting behind the wheel after drinking — evincing the dangers of letting consumers test an evolving, experimental technology on the open road.Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The company, which has released Full Self-Driving to about 400,000 customers, acknowledges that the software is in “beta” mode — meaning still in development, constantly learning and being modified. But Tesla argues that its public release is an essential step toward reducing America’s 40,000 annual road deaths. “The more automation technology offered to support the driver, the safer the driver and other road users,” Tesla tweeted in December.At the same time, Tesla user manuals cite a long list of conditions under which Full Self-Driving may not function properly, including narrow roads with oncoming cars and curvy roads. The company has long maintained that drivers must control their cars and that Tesla is not liable for distracted or drunken driving.[Tesla drivers run Autopilot where it’s not intended — with deadly consequences]Multiple lawsuits have begun challenging the view that drivers are solely responsible when Tesla’s software allegedly causes crashes or fails to prevent them. So far, Tesla has prevailed. Last fall, a California jury found Tesla not liable for a 2019 Autopilot crash in which survivors said the car suddenly veered off the road. At least nine more cases are expected to go to trial this year.Von Ohain’s widow, Nora Bass, said she has been unable to find a lawyer willing to take his case to court because he was legally intoxicated. Nonetheless, she said, Tesla should take at least some responsibility for her husband’s death.“Regardless of how drunk Hans was, Musk has claimed that this car can drive itself and is essentially better than a human,” Bass said. “We were sold a false sense of security.”Hans von Ohain’s Tesla was on fire after the crash. (Obtained by The Washington Post)Von Ohain used Full Self-Driving nearly every time he got behind the wheel, Bass said, placing him among legions of Tesla boosters heeding Musk’s call to generate data and build the technology’s mastery. While Bass refused to use the feature herself — she said its unpredictability stressed her out — her husband was so confident in all it promised that he even used it with their baby in the car.“It was jerky, but we were like, that comes with the territory of” new technology, Bass said. “We knew the technology had to learn, and we were willing to be part of that.”“Now it feels like we were just guinea pigs.”Von Ohain, a former Marine originally from Cincinnati, joined Tesla in late 2020 as a recruiter for engineers, attracted to the company’s mission of bringing electric and autonomous vehicles to the masses, Bass said. He also was inspired by the idea of working for Musk, she said — a “brilliant man” who built a company that promised to save lives and make the roadways safer.Von Ohain “had this opportunity to be part of a company that is working on insanely advanced technology, and we had always thought Elon Musk was interesting,” Bass said. “Hans was so interested in brilliant minds.”At the time, Tesla had just introduced Full Self-Driving, and would eventually release it to a wider group of owners who had been monitored by the carmaker and declared safe drivers. Like many Tesla employees, von Ohain received the feature — then a $10,000 option — free with his employee discount, according to Bass and a purchase order reviewed by The Post.Though still in its beta phase, the technology is “the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero,” Musk has said, noting his customers’ — and investors’ — enthusiasm for a fully autonomous car. Many major automakers were developing advanced driver-assistance technology, but Tesla was more aggressive in pushing sophisticated features out to an eager public.Von Ohain’s parents, Chris and Pam, at their home in Cincinnati. His father said he was disappointed in Tesla for not treating “their own employee who died in their vehicle with a little more empathy.”For years, Musk had preached the benefits of pursuing autonomous driving. In 2019, he predicted that it would one day be so reliable that drivers “could go to sleep” — though, for now, Tesla’s user agreement requires the driver to stay engaged and ready to take over from Full Self-Driving at all times.In 2022, Tesla recalled more than 50,000 vehicles amid concerns that Full Self-Driving caused the car to roll through stop signs without coming to a full halt. Even as Musk tweeted months later that Tesla had made Full Self-Driving Beta available to anyone in North America who bought it, complaints continued to pile up: Drivers reported that cars would stop short, blow through stop signs or suddenly veer off the road when lane markings were unclear.“We test as much as possible in simulation and with [quality assurance] drivers, but reality is vastly more complex,” Musk tweeted last spring about a new version of the software. Tesla employees would get it first, he said, with wider release to come “as confidence grows.”[Tesla conducts largest-ever recall for ‘insufficient’ safety controls after exclusive Post report on Autopilot]“I’m glad it wasn’t Nora and his daughter in that car.”On the day of the crash, von Ohain and Rossiter played 21 holes of golf, downing multiple drinks along the way. Though an autopsy would later show that von Ohain was legally drunk, Rossiter said he seemed composed and “by no means intoxicated” as they got in the Tesla and headed home.Rossiter, who was found to have a similar blood alcohol level, can recall only shreds of the crash: A bright orange glow. Careening off the road. Jumping out of the car and trying to pull his friend out. The driver’s-side door blocked by a fallen tree.As Rossiter yelled for help on the deserted mountain road, he remembers, his friend was screaming inside the burning car.Colorado State Patrol Sgt. Robert Madden, who oversaw the agency’s investigation, said it was one of “the most intense” vehicle fires he had ever seen. Fueled by thousands of lithium-ion battery cells in the car’s undercarriage, according to the investigation report, the fire is what killed von Ohain: His cause of death was listed as “smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.” Madden said he probably would have survived the impact alone.At the scene of the crash, Madden said, he found “rolling tire marks,” meaning the motor continued to feed power to the wheels after impact. There were no skid marks, Madden said, meaning von Ohain appeared not to have hit the brakes.“Given the crash dynamics and how the vehicle drove off the road with no evidence of a sudden maneuver, that fits with the [driver-assistance] feature” being engaged, Madden said.Colorado police were unable to access data from the car because of the intensity of the fire, according to the investigation report, and Tesla said it could not confirm that a driver-assistance system had been in use because it “did not receive data over-the-air for this incident.” Madden said the remote location may have hindered communications.However, Tesla did report the crash to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to NHTSA, Tesla received notification of the crash through an unspecified “complaint” and alerted federal authorities that a driver-assistance feature had been in use at least 30 seconds before impact. Because of the extensive fire damage, NHTSA could not confirm whether it was Full Self-Driving or Autopilot.In December, Tesla acknowledged problems with driver inattention, issuing a recall for nearly all of its 2 million U.S. cars to add more-frequent alerts. Bass said that von Ohain knew he needed to pay attention but that his focus naturally flagged with Full Self-Driving.“You’re told that this car should be smarter than you, so when it’s in Full Self-Driving, you relax,” she said. “Your reaction time is going to be less than if we were not in Full Self-Driving.”Erik Rossiter, the passenger who survived the Tesla crash, on the road where it occurred. Rossiter told emergency responders at the scene that von Ohain was using an “auto drive feature on the Tesla.”Charred remnants of the Tesla after the crash. Von Ohain's wife, Nora Bass, said her husband believed in the promise of Full Self-Driving and used it often, despite its sometimes startling behavior. (Obtained by The Washington Post)Alcohol also dramatically slows reaction time, and von Ohain’s intoxication probably factored heavily in the crash, said Ed Walters, who teaches autonomous vehicle law at Georgetown University. If the technology was acting up on the way to the golf course, as Rossiter claims, von Ohain should have known that he needed to remain fully alert on the drive home, Walters said.“This driver, when sober, was able to pull the car back on the road and was able to correct for any problems in the Tesla safely,” Walters said. “People need to understand that whatever kind of car they’re driving, whatever kind of software, they need to be paying attention. They need to be sober and they need to be careful.”Still, Andrew Maynard, a professor of advanced technology transitions at Arizona State University, said reports of the car’s frequent swerving raise questions about Tesla’s decision to release Full Self-Driving.“The FSD technology isn’t quite ready for prime time yet,” Maynard said, adding that the value of testing the technology on the open road should be weighed against the risks of pushing it out too quickly to drivers who overestimate its capabilities.[Why Tesla Autopilot shouldn’t be used in as many places as you think]“I have so many questions.”Nearly two years later, mangled car parts and charred battery cells are still strewn along Upper Bear Creek Road. Madden closed the Colorado State Patrol investigation, unable to determine whether Full Self-Driving played a role.In a recent interview, Madden said he worries about the proliferation of sophisticated driver-assistance systems. “Autonomous vehicles are something of the future, and they are going to be here,” he said. “So the more we know, the more we understand, the safer we can continue into the future with this” technology.Meanwhile, Tesla has yet to publicly acknowledge the death of an employee driving one of its cars.To its workforce, the company has said little about what happened to von Ohain, making few efforts to console those who knew him, according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Von Ohain’s replacement was hired within a few weeks, the person said.“Once Hans passed away and time went by, there wasn’t any more discussion about him,” said the former employee, a member of von Ohain’s team who soon resigned.To von Ohain’s widow, Tesla’s silence seemed almost cruel.Though the company eventually helped cover the cost of her move back home to Ohio, Bass said, Tesla’s first communication with the family after the crash was a termination notice she found in her husband’s email.Additional development by Jake Crump.

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nA faith healer in skinny jeans is bringing Catholics back to MassA woman prays while awaiting Leda Bergonzi's blessing in Rosario, Argentina. (Sebastián López Brach for The Washington Post)ROSARIO, Argentina — They came by the thousands, praying for a miracle. There was the 21-year-old woman who was paralyzed and intubated. The 66-year-old former truck driver who lost his voice two years ago. A 56-year-old who gradually lost his vision.They rode buses from across the country, camped out overnight and waited in line for hours. Then, one by one, on crutches and in wheelchairs, holding babies and carrying photographs of relatives far away, they approached the woman they hoped would heal them.And one by one, they started to faint.At the front of a packed warehouse, 44-year-old Leda Bergonzi placed her hand on each of their foreheads and whispered into their ears. As she blessed them, some grabbed onto her, sobbing uncontrollably. Others collapsed into her arms or dropped onto the concrete floor. Members of her team stood by, ready to catch people as they fell.“I told myself, I’ll go with all my faith and give it a try,” said Jorge Fernández, a 56-year-old former bricklayer who lost his vision after a traffic accident in 2019 and had traveled to Bergonzi’s ceremony for the sixth time. “Thanks to God and Leda’s touch, I started seeing again.”Argentina has seen previous cases of charismatic priests attracting large crowds in search of healing, including here in Rosario, Argentina’s third largest city. But Bergonzi looks nothing like them. A lay person, she doesn’t wear robes or veils. She favors skinny jeans and high-top sneakers.In the weekly programs, she sings alongside a band while speaking spontaneously in tongues, beneath bright, colorful lights. It’s a scene that would appear at home in an evangelical church, a movement that has rapidly gained ground in Latin America.Bergonzi, though, is Catholic. She describes herself as an intermediary — an instrument for God.And local Catholic leaders are fully behind her.Leda Bergonzi leads a crowd in prayer and song on Oct. 24 in Rosario, Argentina, before spending hours blessing thousands of people. (Video: The Washington Post)A priest keeps watchful vigil over her gatherings, which are preceded by a Mass and Eucharistic adoration. This fall, the archbishop of Rosario released a remarkable statement endorsing her, describing her as a “phenomenon occurring within the Catholic Church.”Here in the home country of Pope Francis, where Catholicism is facing a steep decline, Bergonzi is giving people a reason to return to Mass.The question is whether her movement can reconnect people to the Catholic Church — and keep them coming back.About eight years ago, in a small Catholic prayer group, Bergonzi, a seamstress with five children and a granddaughter, realized she had a divine gift, she says — an ability to heal people through the Holy Spirit.“I’m a normal person, just like you all, going through a call from God,” she said in an interview.She began drawing followers, people who would come to her prayer group every Tuesday. As more and more people shared their testimonies, she began moving into bigger and bigger venues for her weekly ceremonies. Then, after a local news article about her circulated and word spread that soccer star Lionel Messi’s family attended one of her gatherings, her following exploded.“In the past, a healing priest needed decades to become known,” said Diego Mauro, a historian and coordinator of the Observatory of Religious Cultures at the University of Rosario. “It could take a long time for news to reach Buenos Aires, but now, with social media and testimonial videos, it spreads like wildfire. Especially in a political and economic context with so little hope for the future.”About 20,000 people have been showing up every week in Rosario, the city with the highest murder rate in the country and where gangs fight for control of the local drug trade. Arriving on “religious tourism” buses, the pilgrims pack the city’s hotels and restaurants. And on Tuesdays, they join a line about a mile-long in the hopes of being blessed by Bergonzi.Juan José Calandra, a priest from a parish near Rosario who has been accompanying Bergonzi for years, estimates there are at least 10 to 15 “Ledas” in the country. In one of Rosario’s slums, a local priest, Father Ignacio, has drawn believers for many years now. In the late 1990s, the charismatic priest Mario Pantaleo conducted healing sessions in his parish in the Buenos Aires suburbs — and even reportedly helped former Argentine president Carlos Menem.But no one has a following quite like Bergonzi’s, or an operation like the one behind her.She is surrounded by a team of advisers, social media gurus, lawyers and former Argentine soccer stars, all helping to promote and protect her image. Her movement, called Soplo de Diós Viviente, or Breath of the Living God, now claims about 1,000 members in different WhatsApp groups and has been organizing visits to surrounding towns.The team is also collecting medical studies from people who say they have been healed by Bergonzi and presenting them to the Catholic Church as part of a lengthy process that can result in the validation of a miracle or an official healing.Bergonzi said she worries that her fandom will lead people to search for her, rather than for God. “The day that happens, I’ll run,” she said.But the endorsement of local Catholic Church leaders has put her at ease, she said. She aims to help people find the spirituality they have been lacking in a church that has become, to a certain extent, “very conservative,” she said.“To be in a church, what people need is that spirituality and that impactful encounter with God,” she said. “I always say this is a spirituality of impact.”The Bergonzi phenomenon comes amid a crisis of faith among Argentina’s Catholics. According to a survey by pollster Latinobarómetro, just 49 percent of Argentines identified themselves as Catholic by 2020, compared with 76 percent a decade earlier. Similar declines can be seen in almost every country in Latin America, signaling the religion is losing its grip. Many people have instead turned to evangelical, particularly Pentecostal, churches.Javier Milei, the radical libertarian elected president of Argentina last week, has referred to the pope as a “presence of evil.” Some of his associates have even floated the idea of breaking ties with the Vatican.Argentina set for sharp right turn as Trump-like radical wins presidencySome local Catholic leaders hope Bergonzi can help bring people back into the church.“Many people who were estranged from Catholicism are now starting to participate once again,” said Calandra, the priest. “As the business saying goes, it’s better to retain a client than to acquire one. Let’s hope this has an influence.”“In Catholicism, miracles are seen as something extraordinary and almost unattainable in life,” said Mauro, of the University of Rosario. “Phenomena like Leda’s serve to rekindle the enchantment within Catholicism, which has, to some extent, lost its luster.”“Her own aesthetics help: a young, attractive woman with freshness, breaking all traditional molds of a healer priest in a cassock,” he added.Leda Bergonzi sings on stage as part of a weekly prayer group in Rosario, Argentina, that includes a Catholic mass attended by thousands. (Video: The Washington Post)But some within Argentina’s Catholic Church worry the phenomenon could put too much of a focus on miracles — rather than on everyday faith.Pablo Savoia, a priest at Our Lady of Mercy Parish in Buenos Aires and a frequent commentator on Catholicism, urged Catholics not to get carried away. He said the Church must “discern the veracity of this phenomenon.”“Let us not be dazzled by spectacular gifts,” Savoia said.Many of those waiting in line for Bergonzi admitted they had lost touch with the Catholic faith or had never felt much of a desire to go to church. It was unclear whether Bergonzi would manage to change that. For many, the priority — a desperate need for medical solutions — was far more urgent.Abril Gutiérrez, a 19-year-old mother who camped out overnight with her toddler, said she believes in God but isn’t particularly devoted to Catholicism. She just came in the hopes that Bergonzi could heal her daughter.Raul Costello, the 66-year-old truck driver, and his wife, Nancy Geist, came to try out “a bit of faith,\" she said.“We are Catholics, but the truth is that we don’t go to church regularly,” Geist said. “Nowadays, you believe and don’t believe in these things. Some people reach you, and some don’t.”But there was something about Bergonzi that felt sincere, she said.“She has a charisma that draws you in,” she said. “She captures you.”As her followers waited for their moment of impact, on a recent Tuesday afternoon, the line to reach Bergonzi stretched as much as a mile. Two warehouses — each with capacity for 1,300 people — were also packed. Many had been waiting for a full day or camping out on lawn chairs overnight.For almost 12 hours straight, Bergonzi placed her hands on one person after another. She stopped only for short restroom breaks. She consumed only Gatorade and watermelon-flavored Halls lozenges.The reactions, at times, were visceral: Some people cried out. Others seemed to convulse. One woman fainted with her child in her hands. The faintings were so frequent that Bergonzi sometimes stepped over people, collapsed on the floor, to reach the next person. In some cases, for privacy, she and her team would cover someone with a sheet bearing the image of Jesus.She said she doesn’t remember or even register what she tells people. But she can usually tell, immediately, she said, if a person has been healed.One of the first people in line was Nazarena Velazco, 21, who arrived at 4:30 a.m., after traveling five hours from the Cordoba province with her mother.Complications from a surgery to a remove a brainstem tumor had left the young woman paralyzed on the left side of her body and unable to speak or eat on her own. She sat in a wheelchair, connected to a feeding tube. Around her neck was a photo of what she once looked like, surrounded by family at a birthday party.The family is Catholic but “from home,” said her mother, Rosana Ocampo, 54. They hardly ever go to church.She came to Bergonzi, she said, hoping the healer might help restore feeling in her daughter’s body.When Bergonzi placed her hands on Velazco, the young woman’s body appeared to relax, Ocampo recounted. Velazco mouthed the words to her mother: “She is God.”Ocampo was overwhelmed by a sense of peace. It was a strange sensation, she said.",

  "text": "Here’s an unromantic question for Valentine’s Day: Can we live without roses? Yes, they are the most popular cut flower around the world, and that’s no wonder; the blooms are stunning. But the daily, nonstop, global race to get just-cut roses from greenhouses to your front door makes them punishing on the environment. Which means it’s time to think differently.\n\nThis fast-moving game of romantic commerce never stops. It’s also absurd: The race required to provide a mass-produced bit of nature — at any hour, in any place, for as little as $10 a dozen — contributes significantly to the destruction of nature itself.\n\nAirliners filled with flowers zip around the globe every day. Chrysanthemums from Colombia dash to Japan; roses from Kenya end up in Britain; carnations from Ecuador jet to Russia. Nearly all imported cut flowers go through the same emissions-intensive journey — climate-controlled greenhouses, refrigerated trucks and a long, chilled flight. Fresh flowers are a $34 billion global industry with a massive carbon footprint.\n\nCompared with other perishables we transport around the world, flowers are perhaps the most damaging to the climate. The reason? Nearly everything else moves by ship, which has 1 percent the carbon footprint of air freight. A 2020 analysis of products sold in British grocery stores, by climate expert Mike Berners-Lee, found that a bouquet of imported flowers has a more significant impact than an 8-ounce steak raised on deforested land in Brazil and consumed in London.\n\nFor those who adore flowers, like my mom, this might come as a shock. She expressed concern when I told her about the supply chain. “I see the harm,” she said. “But … they’re so beautiful.”\n\nI feel it, too. Flowers play both real and symbolic roles in our lives. They express emotion in a way few things can: sympathy, love, regret, reverence — or just a simple gesture of care.\n\nWe don’t need to give that up.\n\nThere’s plenty the industry can do to reduce its climate impact. Greenhouses should be warmed by renewable energy, which should get easier as countries diversify their energy sources. This is particularly important in the Netherlands, the world’s largest exporter of cut flowers. In that country, with its cloudy, northern climate, highly automated and energy-intensive greenhouses are the norm, the majority of which are powered by fossil fuels. Recently, the Dutch government and the horticulture sector agreed to reduce emissions from these greenhouses. It can’t be an idle commitment.\n\nMost importantly, the sector needs to move away from air freight. Some companies are already experimenting with shipping flowers by sea, an option with substantially fewer emissions. By carefully controlling the atmosphere in the containers, it is possible for cut stems to remain dormant for weeks. Most Western governments have yet to require individual industries to reduce their reliance on air freight, but if lawmakers start issuing those orders, the cut-flower industry should be among the first to be regulated.\n\nConsumers can help, too. Avoid roses, carnations and chrysanthemums, the three species that make up the vast majority of imported flowers. The environmental impact of a bouquet plummets when the flowers are grown locally and are in season.\n\nHardy and with a long vase life, the big three species are perfect for cheap mass production and quick delivery around the world. Their success as a globally produced export means American growers can’t compete. Instead, farmers in the United States primarily cultivate specialty flowers such as sunflowers, dahlias, zinnias and snapdragons. They are more delicate and don’t travel well over long distances.\n\nSo, buy those flowers with the less-common names. They are grown chiefly in California, but small farms also cultivate them across the country. It’s no guarantee, but it’s significantly less likely they arrived via air.\n\nAnother thing consumers can do is to look for the “Certified American Grown” label when buying flowers at the supermarket. This guarantees the blooms were cultivated in the United States. Or better yet? Avoid buying flowers at grocery chains altogether. Instead, request sustainable bouquets from a local florist. Another way to ensure blooms were grown nearby is to purchase them at a local farmers market.\n\nUltimately, the environmental harms from the flower industry stem from our desire for cheap and instant gratification — and the brutally efficient willingness of private industry to produce it. The well-being of people and the planet comes second, if at all.\n\nConfronting this requires re-examining our priorities. Yes, a fresh bouquet means instant beauty; it is more sustainable to plant a few tulips or daylilies, or some phlox or daffodils, and they’ll come back every year. Buy favorite flowers only when they’re in season and get to know what is locally available at different times of the calendar. Loosen the compulsion for rock-bottom prices: Pay more for something grown closer. And give up cultural expectations: Romance doesn’t need to be limited to roses.\n\nBecause when our effort to bring the beauty of nature indoors is harmful to that beauty itself, it begs that we question the absurdity of our way of life.",

  "text": "After the deadliest attack in Israel’s 75-year history, which claimed more than 1,200 lives, Israeli officials have vowed to cripple Hamas — the Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the assault. Israel’s military says it has carried out more than 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. More than 1,100 people have been killed, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nThe Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes. Many were concentrated in heavily populated areas in the north.\n\nIsrael has pledged to focus its fire on Hamas fighters and abide by international law. Hamas said Wednesday that Israeli strikes targeted the head of its military wing, killing his brother. Two members of the group’s political office were killed Tuesday.\n\nBut mosques, hospitals, residential buildings and international aid groups have also been hit. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that 13 health-care facilities were affected by the strikes. Nine U. N. staffers were killed in the strikes.\n\nGazans have lived under an Israeli blockade for 16 years. The 140-square-mile territory is among the most densely populated places on Earth. Of its 2 million people, about half are children — many have never been outside the strip.\n\nIsrael announced a complete siege of Gaza after the attacks. The country cut off power to the territory, leaving many residents in the dark. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials confirmed Gaza’s sole power plant had run out of fuel. Access to water, sanitation facilities and health care will be affected by the outages, aid groups warned.\n\nAll crossings out of the enclave have been closed, leaving residents with nowhere to go.\n\nMore than 263,000 people are displaced across the strip, according to the U. N. Many have sought shelter in overcrowded U.N. schools. More than 1,000 housing units are estimated to have been destroyed.\n\nThe strikes are the beginning of what Israel has said will be its largest-ever offensive in Gaza, where people have already lived through multiple wars since Hamas seized power. Some 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up, the most in 50 years. Troops are massed on Gaza’s border as Hamas continues to fire rockets into Israel.",

  "text": "Three days after the deadliest attack in Israeli history, with at least 900 dead, the country is on the cusp of a long and bloody war in Gaza. More than 300,000 reservists have been called up to serve. But the capacity of Israel’s military, long revered here as a source of stability, suddenly feels like a question mark. Equally unclear is the end game for Netanyahu — with his Gaza containment strategy in ruins, some are calling for a full reoccupation of the territory.\n\nSecurity experts say the war is the result of severe intelligence and military failures. Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been training for weeks near the Israeli border — drilling in rocket launches, kidnapping soldiers and “storming settlements,” Gazan media reported. Yet the assessment from the Israeli military was that Hamas had no appetite for another conflict, a line repeated by trusted media figures.\n\n“The good news in the context of the Gaza Strip is that neither Israel nor Hamas want to see hostilities escalate, each for its own reasons,” columnist Yoav Limor wrote last month in the right-wing newspaper Israel Hayom.\n\nAharon Zeevi Farkash, former head of  the Israel Defense Forces’ military intelligence branch, told Israeli radio station Reshet Bet that “after we are able to probe this, we will see that we knew almost everything. There were intelligence assessments hours before. The question is, did we understand what we knew?”\n\nThe IDF issued rare public statements in recent months, warning that military deterrence was deteriorating. Netanyahu and radical members of his cabinet derided the officials as part of the protest movement, and the protesters as “anarchists,” asserting that the status quo with the Palestinians would hold.\n\n“The modus vivendi was that Hamas takes care of Gaza, Israel allows it to prosper, with the relatively small price that Israel paid every so often, with a round of violence in which Israel would kill thousands of Palestinians and Palestinians would kill dozens of Israelis — that was considered the best Israel could hope for,” said Eran Etzion, former deputy head of Israel’s national security council. “Now that strategic equation has been completely violated.”\n\n“The chaos that has been going on in the past year has created a situation that we’re in now, of putting out fires,” Brik said. “A terror attack here, a terror attack there. They’re not dealing with building the army.”\n\nIsrael’s chaotic and delayed response to the multipronged assault was shocking to Israelis, who watched helplessly on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath and the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, as civilians in the south were left to fend for themselves against Hamas gunmen. Entire families were killed. Children and the elderly were taken to Gaza as hostages.\n\nThe surprise attack started around 6 a.m., with a barrage of rocket fire followed by cross-border attacks. Yet it wasn’t until late afternoon that buses and trains were mobilized to ferry soldiers south. It took some 10 hours for the first troops to arrive in towns overrun by militants.\n\nThe Gaza border, it soon became clear, was minimally manned, and it took hours to redirect units stationed in the West Bank, which has been the main area of focus for the military this year. Palestinian militancy has surged in the occupied territory, from Jenin to Jericho, and Israeli raids have been increasingly common and deadly. Some in Netanyahu’s far-right government had called to annex the West Bank. Gaza, by contrast, appeared stable.\n\n“There was a need for more soldiers, so where did they take them from? From the Gaza border, where they thought it was calm,” said Farkash, the former IDF military intelligence chief. “Not surprising that Hamas and Islamic Jihad noticed the low staffing at the border.”\n\nHamas, designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, assumed power in Gaza in 2007 after Israel withdrew. For years, the group has been digging tunnels, amassing rockets and threatening to take hostages, part of a wider plan to “liberate Palestine.” It has publicly increased its cooperation with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, which has stepped up its provocations in recent months along Israel’s northern border.\n\nAs Israel grapples with the fallout from the attack, many in the south still feel isolated and alone. Much of the most reliable information on the situation there continues to come from citizen networks rather than military officials, who on Monday asserted that towns in the south were “recaptured” despite ongoing fighting with militants.\n\nGaya Calderon, who texted with her 16-year-old sister moments before she, their brothers and their father were abducted by militants and taken to the Gaza Strip, said that she and other relatives of hostages have received no help or guidance — either from the army or the government.",

  "text": "“We are witnessing a paradox: Behind these walls, we have 2 million people that is suffering enormously — that has no water, no food, no medicine, no fuel; that is under fire; that needs everything to survive,” Guterres said. “On this side, we have seen so many trucks, loaded with water, with fuel, with medicines, with food — exactly the same things that are needed on this side of the wall.”\n\nU. N. officials had hoped that Guterres’s media tour Friday would coincide with the resumption of trucks driving across the border — a moment of triumph and relief after days of high-level, high-stakes diplomacy in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Instead, Guterres found himself facing stalled trucks and angry Egyptian aid workers, frustrated at the wait to bring assistance to Palestinians just a few miles away.\n\nThe aid convoy — and the difficult dealmaking to get it across the border — represent the opening gambit in efforts to seek a steady flow of relief supplies into Gaza. On Saturday, Egyptian officials plan to host a “summit for peace,” which Guterres is scheduled to attend before returning to New York.\n\nInside Gaza, however, Palestinians told The Washington Post that distributing the aid would be extremely dangerous for them without a halt in Israeli airstrikes, which have continued across the coastal enclave, including in areas in the south that Israel said would be considered safe zones.\n\nThat’s a fraction of the more than 200 trucks from the United Nations, Egyptian Red Crescent and other sources that are ready to deliver supplies to Gaza. Guterres said the details of how the aid will be verified and whether it will be a continuous flow remain under discussion.\n\n“We are now actively engaged with” Israel, Egypt and the United States, he said. “Those verifications need to be effective, and at the same time, those verifications need to be done in a way that is practical and in a way that is expedited.”\n\nThe United Nations has offered up their inspectors, who have conducted similar checks on aid entering northwest Syria. But a key sticking point has been that the Israelis want “direct eyes” on the crossing, said an official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the delicate negotiations. “The question is where and how,” the official said.\n\n“We demand the opening of the crossing so we can support our Palestinian brothers,” said Abdelrahman El-Sayid, 22, a volunteer with Abnaa Sinai, a regional logistics company that also does charity work. He had been stuck there for four days, waiting to bring medicine and food aid across to Gaza, he said.\n\nAhead of his visit to the crossing, Guterres inspected a flight at the Arish airport carrying supplies destined for Gaza. The plane included 44 tons of food supplies donated by the United Arab Emirates, 17 tons of materials for tents and 10 tons of emergency trauma kits to be distributed by the United Nations and the Egyptian Red Crescent.\n\n“We need to have as quickly as possible the first convoy, and we need to create all the guarantees for that first convoy not to be the last,”  Guterres told reporters on the tarmac.\n\nSince Oct. 7, Israel has tightened its siege on Gaza, and airstrikes have damaged parts of the Rafah crossing on the Gazan side. The war has also displaced around 1 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people. More than half of the displaced are sheltering in United Nation schools, hospitals and storage centers, according to the U. N.’s refugee agency.\n\nAl-Qudra said Friday that seven hospitals were completely closed due to Israeli shelling and another 21 medical centers shut after running out of fuel. Fuel for the generators at al-Shifa Hospital, the main hospital in Gaza City and one of the few remaining places with electricity, will run out within 24 hours, Guillemette Thomas, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday.",

  "text": "“American leadership is what holds the world together,” he added. “American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it’s just not worth it.”\n\nThe speech culminated an extraordinary week for Biden, who set aside his schedule for a whirlwind trip into a war zone to appear alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The trip is likely to stand out as a signature moment of his presidency, though the outcome is far from certain as the Middle East remains engulfed in violent turmoil.\n\nWhile emphasizing the steadfast U. S. support of Israel, Biden reiterated his warning against being driven by fury. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, he said, “We made mistakes. So I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage. And here in America, let us not forget who we are.”\n\nU. N. Secretary General António Guterres on Thursday urged “rapid, unimpeded access for humanitarian aid” to the Palestinian enclave, citing an “ever-mounting toll” on civilians who have lacked water, food, fuel and electricity for more than a week. Hospitals in Gaza are being overrun with casualties from Israeli airstrikes, with patients sleeping on floors and some facilities turning off lights off to save energy, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nThe portion of the aid package going to Israel would be aimed at strengthening the country’s Iron Dome air defense system, Biden said. The United States has already positioned two aircraft carriers and their escort ships near Israel and sent thousands of soldiers and Marines to staff them, driven by concern that the conflict could flare into a broader regional war.\n\nHe will have to overcome resistance from a significant number of House Republicans who have been agitating to slash aid to Ukraine — in some cases, to nothing. America, they argue, has little at stake in a faraway war between two remote countries, and the money would be better spent on such uses as securing America’s southern border.\n\nPublic support for Ukraine is also slipping. A Washington Post-ABC poll last month found 41 percent of Americans said the United States was doing too much to support Ukraine, while 50 percent said it was doing about the right amount or too little. Among Republicans, however, 59 percent said the United States was doing too much to aid Kyiv.\n\nReflecting that dynamic, Biden spent a good portion of his address warning about the risks of abandoning Ukraine to Putin’s aggression. He recalled the secretive trip he made to Kyiv in February with only a handful of security agents accompanying him, a visit that in some ways was similar to his trip Wednesday to Israel while it was in a state of war.\n\nAt least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the unprecedented cross-border Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities have said, when militants hunted down and attacked civilians. Palestinian officials have said that 3,785 people in Gaza have been killed and more than 12,400 wounded in the airstrikes that Israel has launched in response.",

  "text": "On Google’s YouTube and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, you can stand with Israel, call for peace or lament the plight of Palestinians. But expressions of support for Hamas are forbidden. Both companies consider Hamas an extremist organization, meaning that no one affiliated with the group is allowed to use their platforms, and no videos or images created by Hamas can be posted there.\n\nIn contrast, the influential messaging platform Telegram does very little content moderation. It hosts a Hamas channel that has been openly broadcasting grisly footage and images of dead Israelis to more than 100,000 subscribers. And some of those posts have been rebroadcast on Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, which nominally prohibits Hamas content but appears to be doing relatively little to police it after Musk laid off the majority of the company’s employees.\n\nExperts say X in particular has become a hub for posts and videos taken down by other platforms for violating their rules against graphic violence or hate speech. On Tuesday, European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton posted a letter to Musk warning him that regulators have “indications” that the site may be in violation of European rules on violent and terrorist content, as well as disinformation.\n\nIn the case of the Israel-Gaza war, those calls are complicated by a desire to avoid being seen as abetting a terrorist organization by enabling it to broadcast propaganda, threats, hostage videos or even executions. Facebook has been sued in the past by the families of people killed by Hamas. And earlier this year, Google, Twitter and Meta defended themselves at the Supreme Court against charges that they had materially aided the Islamic State terrorist group  by hosting or recommending its content, such as recruiting videos. (In each of those cases, the tech firms prevailed.)\n\nBut defining what counts as an extremist group isn’t always straightforward, and social media platforms over the years have faced scrutiny over which government actors, political movements, military operations and violent regimes get a voice and which don’t. After the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan in 2021, social media companies had to make a high-stakes decision about whether to continue to ban the Taliban, since it had taken over the country’s government.\n\n“Within social media companies, the category that you’re placed in determines how your speech is going to be treated,” said Anika Collier Navaroli, senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and a former senior Twitter policy official. “The speech of a political party is going to be treated extremely different than the speech that comes from a terrorist. The speech from a legitimate nation-state is also going to be treated different than somebody who is not recognized as that.”\n\nOn TikTok, both the #Israel and #Palestine hashtags have attracted tens of billions of views as young people turn to the platform for news and perspectives on the conflict. But at least one prominent account that covers news from a Palestinian perspective received a notice Monday that it had been permanently banned. TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said Tuesday that the ban was a mistake and that the account, Mondoweiss, was reinstated.\n\nSince Hamas’s incursion began, TikTok has shifted more content moderators to focus on posts about the conflict, including posts in Arabic and Hebrew, Favazza said. It has also been blocking some hashtags associated with graphic violence or terrorist propaganda, including footage of hostages or executions. And it is working with fact-checkers to identify misinformation, though a quick browse through popular searches such as “Israel” and “Gaza” on Tuesday turned up numerous videos from previous, unrelated conflicts that were being presented as though they were new. Other videos racked up views with graphic footage of Israeli victims, likely produced originally by Hamas, with a thin veneer of commentary decrying the acts.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement that the company had established “a special operations center” with experts who are fluent in Hebrew and Arabic to closely monitor the situation. “Our teams are working around the clock to keep our platforms safe, take action on content that violates our policies or local law, and coordinate with third-party fact checkers in the region to limit the spread of misinformation,” Stone said.\n\nOn Telegram, an apparently official Hamas account with close to 120,000 subscribers has routinely posted grisly video of the attacks on Israel. One clip, with more than 77,000 views, showed an unidentified militant stomping on a dead soldier’s face. Many of the videos have been reposted to X. At least one of the videos was also posted by the media outlet Al Jazeera Arabic to YouTube, where it has nearly 13 million subscribers, but with some of the gore blurred.",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

  "text": "Israeli troops are massing around the Gaza Strip, poised for a ground invasion that could involve heavy urban combat in the densely populated territory. The buildup of force comes after attackers from the militant group Hamas, which controls the enclave, crossed into southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces have already pummeled the strip with airstrikes, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nIsrael withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005. In 2008 and 2014, Israeli forces entered the territory in multiweek campaigns that Israel said were aimed at impeding Hamas’s capabilities.\n\nThe fighting killed more than 3,500 Palestinians and more than 70 Israeli soldiers in total.\n\nThis operation may be much more extensive. Israel has vowed to “destroy” Hamas.\n\n“Basically, what the Israelis are aiming for is complete regime change in Gaza, which is a notable break from” past campaigns, said Raphael Cohen, a senior political scientist at Rand Corp. He expected a long, brutal fight. “If you want to root out Hamas, it’s going to last a lot more than 50 days like Protective Edge,” said Cohen, referring to the IDF’s 2014 operation.\n\nMany civilians have already been killed in Gaza and 1 million have been displaced according to the United Nations.\n\n“A ground campaign will inevitably have grave implications for civilians in Gaza,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “The dense urban nature of the [Gaza Strip] will ensure that such an operation will face fierce resistance and will require massive use of force by Israel.”\n\nHe added that “Hamas’s practice of storing and using rockets and military assets among civilians and in humanitarian facilities will further increase the exposure of civilians to risk.”\n\nTo dismantle Hamas, the IDF, one of the world’s most powerful militaries, would have to fight in Gaza’s dense neighborhoods with limited space to maneuver.\n\nHamas, which analysts say spent at least two years planning the rampage that caught Israeli forces by surprise, is likely to have prepared for a large-scale retaliation.\n\nA ground offensive into Gaza could compound the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis there.\n\nAn Israeli siege on the enclave has meant almost all its fuel and power are gone. Food, drinking water and medical supplies are running out.\n\n“It seems that major ground operations are likely to focus on Gaza City, at least initially, with perhaps limited ground incursions elsewhere,” said Michael Eisenstadt, director of the military and security studies program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “But air and naval artillery strikes are likely to continue against targets throughout the Gaza Strip.”\n\nIsrael has urged Gazans to evacuate to the south, away from Gaza City, before a ground incursion, but on Tuesday the United Nations cited reports “that civilians attempting to relocate to southern Gaza were struck and killed by an explosive weapon.” The southern Rafah crossing into Egypt remains closed.\n\n“What makes this round even more concerning is that it is likely to extend for an unprecedented period of time, where civilians will not only be exposed to direct risk of death and injury from the fighting, but also to protracted, severe shortages of basic humanitarian needs,” al-Omari said.",

For Putin, it was a chance to explain his justification for the Russian invasion of Ukraine to a sympathetic voice in American conservatism, just as congressional Republicans are considering whether to approve a Ukrainian aid package. For Carlson, it was an opportunity to bolster his relevance after being fired from Fox News last year — and promote his new media venture at the same time.\n\nBut Carlson’s much-touted interview, recorded on Tuesday and released on Thursday evening, ran into a problem as soon as it began. In his attempt to justify the invasion, Putin spent a significant part of the interview focused on a tedious recounting of Russian and Ukrainian history, to the point that Carlson became irritated and the two began to clash.\n\n“Putin went on for a very long time, probably half an hour, about the history of Russia,” the former prime-time star explained in his preamble from a spot overlooking Moscow’s Red Square as snow fell around him. “... And honestly, we thought this was a filibustering technique and found it annoying and interrupted him several times, and he responded. He was annoyed by the interruption.”\n\nPutin’s lengthy version of the history between the two countries — which he’s laid out before, and has been criticized as a revisionist pretext for war by some historians — went back as far as the 9th century, name-checking the likes of “Prince Rurik” and “Prince Yaroslav the Wise” in an attempt to argue that Ukrainians are actually Russian.\n\nCarlson later claimed that he understood why Putin needed to discuss so much history, but as he tried to cut in during the interview, the Russian president grew irritated.\n\n“I asked you at the beginning, are we going to have a serious talk or a show?” Putin said at one point, speaking through an interpreter. “You said a serious talk. So bear with me, please.”\n\nOn Fox News, Carlson was a master of combative interviews, carefully controlling their flow with interjections and even undermining his subjects by flashing a blank look on his face or a mischievous smile. But in Moscow, Carlson was a bystander for much of his own interview, interjecting only briefly. He also didn’t ask the Russian president about a number of challenging topics, from Russian atrocities in Ukraine to Putin’s attacks on internal dissent.\n\nThe disputes between Carlson and Putin were a surprise in part because they have recently agreed on so much. Carlson has called Ukraine an undemocratic “client state” used to provoke Russia into war, words that echoed Putin so closely that an anti-Trump Republican group created a viral video in 2023 that paired Carlson’s rhetoric with Putin’s.\n\nStill, Carlson’s disagreements with Putin about the interview itself became clear even before the interview aired. Earlier this week, in a promotional video for the interview, Carlson falsely portrayed himself as the only Western reporter who had “bothered” to interview Putin. That carried with it an insinuation, deliberate or not, that Putin isn’t important enough to interview, sparking pushback from a Putin spokesman who claimed Putin has received “many” interview requests.\n\nDespite his fleeting clashes with Carlson, Putin still used the interview to portray Russia as a country acting in self-defense, beset by NATO and the CIA. And while most of the discussion focused on the war, Carlson also granted Putin a forum to hold forth on the grand intellectual questions of our time.\n\nIn one of the interview’s stranger questions, Carlson asked how a world leader could profess to be a Christian while ordering violence, only to see the Russian president brush the question away by praising Russia’s “moral values.” Carlson also asked Putin when he thought an “AI empire” of self-aware machines would begin.\n\n“I think there’s no stopping Elon Musk,” Putin replied, referring to the billionaire owner of X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, who has welcomed Carlson’s show onto his platform. “He will do as he sees fit.”\n\n“I just want to ask you directly, without getting into the details of it or your version of what happened, if, as a sign of your decency, you would be willing to release him to us and we’ll bring him back to the United States,” Carlson said.\n\nThere was a sense even among some of Carlson’s allies that the interview had failed to reach its full promise. On X, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn — who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying about his own contacts with the Russian government — said viewers should understand that Carlson was probably subjected to negotiated terms about the interview.",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

  "text": "JERUSALEM — The historic Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza’s oldest active church, was struck Thursday by Israel as it sheltered hundreds of Palestinians displaced by the war, according to religious officials. Maher Ayyad, 72, a member of the community, said the strike hit a two-story building in the church compound, killing 18 people and injuring at least 20. About 100 people were in the bombed building at the time of the strike, he said, and about 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.\n\nAmash tweeted Friday afternoon that several relatives who had been sheltering in the church, including two women he identified as Viola and Yara, were killed in the strike.\n\nThere are about 1,000 Palestinian Christians remaining in Gaza, and the loss was “huge” for the community, Ayyad said. About 500 Christians, including Ayyad, have relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.\n\nThe Washington Post geolocated the strike and confirmed the location of the church based on a video that shows people searching through rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem blamed Israel for the strike.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in an emailed statement that a strike targeting a Hamas control center “damaged the wall of a church in the area” and that it was “aware of reports on casualties” and was reviewing the incident. They declined to provide further information and reiterated, “It is important to clarify that the Church was not the target of the strike.”\n\nAyyad is also a medical director at al-Ahli Hospital, where a blast Tuesday killed 471 people and injured more than 300, according to Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has disputed that death toll.\n\nThe Order of St. George, an associated order of the church, issued a statement confirming Thursday’s strike. “Archbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don’t know if he is injured,” the Order of St. George stated. The blast hit “two church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping.”\n\nThe Church of St. Porphyrius’s original structure dated to the 5th century, and the current structure, in a historic quarter of the city, was built in the 12th century. It is named for a former bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, and placed where he is believed to have died in A. D. 420. The church, characterized by thick walls and a richly decorated interior, has long been a place of refuge and community for its members, who are a religious minority in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA Palestinian American woman who moved from Gaza to the United States in the early 2000s said in an interview that she had relatives and friends sheltering in the church at the time of the strike, some of whom were injured.\n\n“They’re terrified. They’re shaken. They don’t know what to do, and they don’t know where else to go,” said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her family’s safety. She expressed outrage at the idea that more than 1 million civilians could evacuate from a place as densely populated and heavily bombed as Gaza City — a mass movement called for by Israel last week. “It’s impossible,” she said.\n\nShe said that she grew up going to the Church of St. Porphyrius and that her family has deep ties to the church, dating to when they became refugees during the 1948 founding of Israel and mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nDescribing the congregation as close-knit and family-like, she said she’s not only worried about her relatives. “I’m concerned for everyone because we’re a small community.”\n\nChristians make up about 1 percent of Gaza’s population and have faced restrictions and discrimination by the Hamas government, according to human rights groups. During the 2014 Gaza war, about 1,000 Palestinian Muslims fled Israeli shelling for the Church of St. Porphyrius, where graves were damaged by shrapnel from a nearby strike, Reuters reported.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nTesla worker killed in fiery crash may be first ‘Full Self-Driving’ fatalityEvidence suggests the advanced driver-assistance system was engaged during a fatal crash that killed recruiter Hans von Ohain in 2022Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. The following footage obtained by The Washington Post shows Colorado authorities responding to a car crash on May 16, 2022, in Evergreen, Colo.This story is best experienced with sound.Hans von Ohain and Erik Rossiter were on their way to play golf one afternoon in 2022 when von Ohain’s Tesla suddenly swerved off Upper Bear Creek Road. The car’s driver-assistance software, Full Self-Driving, was struggling to navigate the mountain curves, forcing von Ohain repeatedly to yank it back on course.“The first time it happened, I was like, ‘Is that normal?’” recalled Rossiter, who described the five-mile drive on the outskirts of Denver as “uncomfortable.” “And he was like, ‘Yeah, that happens every now and then.’”Hours later, on the way home, the Tesla Model 3 barreled into a tree and exploded in flames, killing von Ohain, a Tesla employee and devoted fan of CEO Elon Musk. Rossiter, who survived the crash, told emergency responders that von Ohain was using an “auto-drive feature on the Tesla” that “just ran straight off the road,” according to a 911 dispatch recording obtained by The Washington Post. In a recent interview, Rossiter said he believes that von Ohain was using Full Self-Driving, which — if true — would make his death the first known fatality involving Tesla’s most advanced driver-assistance technology.Tesla owners have long complained of occasionally erratic behavior by the cars’ software, including sudden braking, missed road markings and crashes with parked emergency vehicles. Since federal regulators began requiring automakers to report crashes involving driver-assistance systems in 2021, they have logged more than 900 in Teslas, including at least 40 that resulted in serious or fatal injuries, according to a Post analysis.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselHow The Post determined Full Self-Driving likely was engagedThe crash appears in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s database of crashes reported to involve driver assistance software. Tesla reported the crash to NHTSA after receiving a complaint from an unspecified source.A purchase order obtained by The Post shows the car was equipped with Full Self-Driving, and the driver’s widow said he used it frequently, especially on the road where the crash occurred.A passenger who survived the crash said the driver used Full Self-Driving earlier in the day, and that he believes the feature was engaged at the time of the crash.According to 911 dispatch audio obtained by The Post, the survivor told emergency responders that an “auto-drive” feature had been in use. A state police investigator told The Post that crash dynamics were consistent with the feature’s use.Most involved Autopilot, which is designed for use on controlled-access highways. No fatal crash has been definitively linked to the more sophisticated Full Self-Driving, which is programmed to guide the car almost anywhere, from quiet suburban roads to busy city streets.Two years ago, a Tesla shareholder tweeted that there “has not been one accident or injury” involving Full Self-Driving, to which Musk responded: “Correct.” But if that was accurate at the time, it no longer appears to be so. A Tesla driver who caused an eight-car pileup with multiple injuries on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in 2022 told police he was using Full Self-Driving. And The Post has linked the technology to at least two serious crashes, including the one that killed von Ohain.Von Ohain and Rossiter had been drinking, and an autopsy found that von Ohain died with a blood alcohol level of 0.26 — more than three times the legal limit — a level of intoxication that would have hampered his ability to maintain control of the car, experts said. Still, an investigation by the Colorado State Patrol went beyond drunken driving, seeking to understand what role the Tesla software may have played in the crash.“Next thing I remember is waking up in the vehicle.”The question is critical as automakers race toward the promise of a driverless future. For private vehicles, that day is far from here. But critics say features like Full Self-Driving already are giving drivers a false sense of confidence about taking their eyes off the road — or getting behind the wheel after drinking — evincing the dangers of letting consumers test an evolving, experimental technology on the open road.Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The company, which has released Full Self-Driving to about 400,000 customers, acknowledges that the software is in “beta” mode — meaning still in development, constantly learning and being modified. But Tesla argues that its public release is an essential step toward reducing America’s 40,000 annual road deaths. “The more automation technology offered to support the driver, the safer the driver and other road users,” Tesla tweeted in December.At the same time, Tesla user manuals cite a long list of conditions under which Full Self-Driving may not function properly, including narrow roads with oncoming cars and curvy roads. The company has long maintained that drivers must control their cars and that Tesla is not liable for distracted or drunken driving.[Tesla drivers run Autopilot where it’s not intended — with deadly consequences]Multiple lawsuits have begun challenging the view that drivers are solely responsible when Tesla’s software allegedly causes crashes or fails to prevent them. So far, Tesla has prevailed. Last fall, a California jury found Tesla not liable for a 2019 Autopilot crash in which survivors said the car suddenly veered off the road. At least nine more cases are expected to go to trial this year.Von Ohain’s widow, Nora Bass, said she has been unable to find a lawyer willing to take his case to court because he was legally intoxicated. Nonetheless, she said, Tesla should take at least some responsibility for her husband’s death.“Regardless of how drunk Hans was, Musk has claimed that this car can drive itself and is essentially better than a human,” Bass said. “We were sold a false sense of security.”Hans von Ohain’s Tesla was on fire after the crash. (Obtained by The Washington Post)Von Ohain used Full Self-Driving nearly every time he got behind the wheel, Bass said, placing him among legions of Tesla boosters heeding Musk’s call to generate data and build the technology’s mastery. While Bass refused to use the feature herself — she said its unpredictability stressed her out — her husband was so confident in all it promised that he even used it with their baby in the car.“It was jerky, but we were like, that comes with the territory of” new technology, Bass said. “We knew the technology had to learn, and we were willing to be part of that.”“Now it feels like we were just guinea pigs.”Von Ohain, a former Marine originally from Cincinnati, joined Tesla in late 2020 as a recruiter for engineers, attracted to the company’s mission of bringing electric and autonomous vehicles to the masses, Bass said. He also was inspired by the idea of working for Musk, she said — a “brilliant man” who built a company that promised to save lives and make the roadways safer.Von Ohain “had this opportunity to be part of a company that is working on insanely advanced technology, and we had always thought Elon Musk was interesting,” Bass said. “Hans was so interested in brilliant minds.”At the time, Tesla had just introduced Full Self-Driving, and would eventually release it to a wider group of owners who had been monitored by the carmaker and declared safe drivers. Like many Tesla employees, von Ohain received the feature — then a $10,000 option — free with his employee discount, according to Bass and a purchase order reviewed by The Post.Though still in its beta phase, the technology is “the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero,” Musk has said, noting his customers’ — and investors’ — enthusiasm for a fully autonomous car. Many major automakers were developing advanced driver-assistance technology, but Tesla was more aggressive in pushing sophisticated features out to an eager public.Von Ohain’s parents, Chris and Pam, at their home in Cincinnati. His father said he was disappointed in Tesla for not treating “their own employee who died in their vehicle with a little more empathy.”For years, Musk had preached the benefits of pursuing autonomous driving. In 2019, he predicted that it would one day be so reliable that drivers “could go to sleep” — though, for now, Tesla’s user agreement requires the driver to stay engaged and ready to take over from Full Self-Driving at all times.In 2022, Tesla recalled more than 50,000 vehicles amid concerns that Full Self-Driving caused the car to roll through stop signs without coming to a full halt. Even as Musk tweeted months later that Tesla had made Full Self-Driving Beta available to anyone in North America who bought it, complaints continued to pile up: Drivers reported that cars would stop short, blow through stop signs or suddenly veer off the road when lane markings were unclear.“We test as much as possible in simulation and with [quality assurance] drivers, but reality is vastly more complex,” Musk tweeted last spring about a new version of the software. Tesla employees would get it first, he said, with wider release to come “as confidence grows.”[Tesla conducts largest-ever recall for ‘insufficient’ safety controls after exclusive Post report on Autopilot]“I’m glad it wasn’t Nora and his daughter in that car.”On the day of the crash, von Ohain and Rossiter played 21 holes of golf, downing multiple drinks along the way. Though an autopsy would later show that von Ohain was legally drunk, Rossiter said he seemed composed and “by no means intoxicated” as they got in the Tesla and headed home.Rossiter, who was found to have a similar blood alcohol level, can recall only shreds of the crash: A bright orange glow. Careening off the road. Jumping out of the car and trying to pull his friend out. The driver’s-side door blocked by a fallen tree.As Rossiter yelled for help on the deserted mountain road, he remembers, his friend was screaming inside the burning car.Colorado State Patrol Sgt. Robert Madden, who oversaw the agency’s investigation, said it was one of “the most intense” vehicle fires he had ever seen. Fueled by thousands of lithium-ion battery cells in the car’s undercarriage, according to the investigation report, the fire is what killed von Ohain: His cause of death was listed as “smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.” Madden said he probably would have survived the impact alone.At the scene of the crash, Madden said, he found “rolling tire marks,” meaning the motor continued to feed power to the wheels after impact. There were no skid marks, Madden said, meaning von Ohain appeared not to have hit the brakes.“Given the crash dynamics and how the vehicle drove off the road with no evidence of a sudden maneuver, that fits with the [driver-assistance] feature” being engaged, Madden said.Colorado police were unable to access data from the car because of the intensity of the fire, according to the investigation report, and Tesla said it could not confirm that a driver-assistance system had been in use because it “did not receive data over-the-air for this incident.” Madden said the remote location may have hindered communications.However, Tesla did report the crash to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to NHTSA, Tesla received notification of the crash through an unspecified “complaint” and alerted federal authorities that a driver-assistance feature had been in use at least 30 seconds before impact. Because of the extensive fire damage, NHTSA could not confirm whether it was Full Self-Driving or Autopilot.In December, Tesla acknowledged problems with driver inattention, issuing a recall for nearly all of its 2 million U.S. cars to add more-frequent alerts. Bass said that von Ohain knew he needed to pay attention but that his focus naturally flagged with Full Self-Driving.“You’re told that this car should be smarter than you, so when it’s in Full Self-Driving, you relax,” she said. “Your reaction time is going to be less than if we were not in Full Self-Driving.”Erik Rossiter, the passenger who survived the Tesla crash, on the road where it occurred. Rossiter told emergency responders at the scene that von Ohain was using an “auto drive feature on the Tesla.”Charred remnants of the Tesla after the crash. Von Ohain's wife, Nora Bass, said her husband believed in the promise of Full Self-Driving and used it often, despite its sometimes startling behavior. (Obtained by The Washington Post)Alcohol also dramatically slows reaction time, and von Ohain’s intoxication probably factored heavily in the crash, said Ed Walters, who teaches autonomous vehicle law at Georgetown University. If the technology was acting up on the way to the golf course, as Rossiter claims, von Ohain should have known that he needed to remain fully alert on the drive home, Walters said.“This driver, when sober, was able to pull the car back on the road and was able to correct for any problems in the Tesla safely,” Walters said. “People need to understand that whatever kind of car they’re driving, whatever kind of software, they need to be paying attention. They need to be sober and they need to be careful.”Still, Andrew Maynard, a professor of advanced technology transitions at Arizona State University, said reports of the car’s frequent swerving raise questions about Tesla’s decision to release Full Self-Driving.“The FSD technology isn’t quite ready for prime time yet,” Maynard said, adding that the value of testing the technology on the open road should be weighed against the risks of pushing it out too quickly to drivers who overestimate its capabilities.[Why Tesla Autopilot shouldn’t be used in as many places as you think]“I have so many questions.”Nearly two years later, mangled car parts and charred battery cells are still strewn along Upper Bear Creek Road. Madden closed the Colorado State Patrol investigation, unable to determine whether Full Self-Driving played a role.In a recent interview, Madden said he worries about the proliferation of sophisticated driver-assistance systems. “Autonomous vehicles are something of the future, and they are going to be here,” he said. “So the more we know, the more we understand, the safer we can continue into the future with this” technology.Meanwhile, Tesla has yet to publicly acknowledge the death of an employee driving one of its cars.To its workforce, the company has said little about what happened to von Ohain, making few efforts to console those who knew him, according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Von Ohain’s replacement was hired within a few weeks, the person said.“Once Hans passed away and time went by, there wasn’t any more discussion about him,” said the former employee, a member of von Ohain’s team who soon resigned.To von Ohain’s widow, Tesla’s silence seemed almost cruel.Though the company eventually helped cover the cost of her move back home to Ohio, Bass said, Tesla’s first communication with the family after the crash was a termination notice she found in her husband’s email.Additional development by Jake Crump.

  "text": "Defense officials have ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza after militants broke through its border wall into southern Israel on Saturday and killed at least 1,200 people, many of them civilians — the deadliest day in Israeli history. In Israel and Gaza, people brace for a long and costly war“No power, no food, no gas,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. “We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.” Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, orchestrated the ambush over the weekend, when militants took more than 100 hostages to Gaza.\n\nIsrael has bombarded the densely populated enclave in retaliation, killing at least 1,100 people. On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that the border with Gaza was secured and that it was preparing for an offensive.\n\nThe Gaza Strip, a 140-square-mile stretch of land with more than 2 million people, depends on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Cutting off gas and power from the territory could leave many residents not only without power, but without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care. On Wednesday, Palestinian authorities said Gaza’s only power plant has run out of fuel and stopped operating.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General António Guterres condemned the siege Monday. “The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,” he said in a statement.\n\nIsrael provides Gaza with power in two ways. Gaza’s sole power plant is operated by diesel fuel, which enters Gaza from the Karem Shalom crossing. There are also 10 direct power lines from Israel to Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli siege could also “result in a severe shortage of already scarce drinkable water,” the United Nations said. The territory has several major desalination plants, which transform water from the Mediterranean Sea into drinkable water, but they need power to operate.\n\nSanitation facilities, too, could be crippled by the outages, increasing concerns about disease. Past fuel shortages in Gaza have caused sewage from the strip to contaminate agricultural land and spill into Israel.\n\nGaza “was on the edge of a humanitarian crisis for a very long time,” said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East regional director of Mercy Corps. “So this additional shock is going to turn this into a full-blown crisis very quickly.”\n\nIsrael withdrew its civilian population and military forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but has continued to control the flow of goods and people. When Hamas assumed political power of the territory in 2007, Israel imposed an air and sea blockade, which is also enforced by Egypt to the south.\n\nOver the course of the 16-year blockade, Israel has imposed shutdowns during key moments in the conflict, including Operation Cast Lead, which began in December 2008, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014. Those military campaigns killed more than 3,500 Palestinians in total.\n\n“Israel used its control over the access to goods and infrastructure needs as a way of creating a carrot-and-stick approach to the governing body in Gaza, Hamas,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “If things are calm, things are opened up. If things get tense, Israel shuts the spigot.”\n\nThe siege could also affect hospitals, which can run on generators but need fuel to power them. Several health-care facilities were already hit by Israeli strikes.\n\n“We are very concerned to see that medical facilities have not been spared,” Léo Cans, Doctors Without Borders’ head of mission in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement. “[An] airstrike destroyed an ambulance carrying the wounded, right in front of the hospital where we work.”\n\nIsrael has justified its overwhelming use of force by saying it must destroy Hamas’s military capabilities to prevent any future assaults on the country.",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute that founded the court. The Palestinian territories joined the ICC in 2015, giving the court jurisdiction over crimes committed there — including in Gaza — or by Palestinian nationals in other territories.\n\nIn practice, however, international calls for justice are rarely without controversy — especially within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has roots dating to the late 19th century.",

  "text": "The Gaza Strip’s health-care system stands on the brink of collapse as bombings damage hospitals and ambulances and as generators run out of fuel, highlighting how quality medical care is a casualty of war. Dire scenarios await Gaza’s medical professionals. They face dwindling basic resources such as power, water and anesthesia, compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save. The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health-care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human-made and natural disasters — assessing staffing and other resources, managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones, and looking out for their own welfare.\n\n“When we are in a disaster setting or conflict, we usually have more patients than resources. We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people,” said Lindsey Ryan Martin, who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza.\n\n“Health workers, why would they stay?” Griffiths said. “And how can you move the sick people that we’ve already been discussing for the last few days, coming out of the hospital in Gaza City — how can you move them when they’re in ICUs?”\n\nAn anesthesia specialist at al-Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed. He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene: patients being treated on a teal floor, a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient.\n\nThe hospital worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters, worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply. He’s already seeing infections, diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children.\n\nThe hospital worker said he last slept properly on Oct. 5, before the conflict began, and doesn’t know whether his home is still standing. “It’s also the last time I saw my wife and my kids,” he said.\n\nErica L. Nelson, who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years, said Palestinian doctors at al-Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted. “The additional component of ‘We are at risk’ has changed the tenor of the conversation,” said Nelson, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply. Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities “extremely dangerous,” according to Doctors Without Borders, which has staff on the ground in Gaza. The U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients. All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel.\n\n“When fuel runs out, that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that don’t require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services,” said John Broach, director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester, Mass.\n\nBroach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated, such as people with well-managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies.\n\n“Soon all the team is burned out, their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions,” said Callaway, who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine.\n\nThe decisions health-care workers face in disasters are momentous: As they focus on the patient in front of them, they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere. “You feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment,” Callaway said. “Is a kid’s life more valuable than an elderly person’s?”\n\nResources simply were not available to treat everyone in need, he said. “You can be forced into a situation where you can’t do what’s best for your patient, either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die,” Kirsch said.\n\nPaul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do. As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide, Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could, amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures. “You have no choice,” he said. “You tell yourself you’ll probably do it better than a layperson.”\n\nThe health-care system in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, already struggled before the war. The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods, which can restrict care. Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014, when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50-day Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

  "text": "First, a man rams a skateboard into the passenger window of a white vehicle. He exits the frame, then returns and slams his drink container into the windshield. Bystanders can be seen cheering the people vandalizing the car, as others record on their phones. Soon the car is engulfed in flames.\n\nScenes of chaos from San Francisco’s Chinatown spread across social media Sunday after a mob vandalized and set fire to a Waymo self-driving car using a firework on Saturday evening. Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, has been offering Californians a 24/7 taxi service in driverless cars since the summer.\n\n“Waymo Vehicle surrounded and then graffiti’d,” the San Francisco Fire Department said on social media hours later. “Windows were broken, and firework lit on fire inside the vehicle which ultimately caught the entire vehicle on fire.”\n\nPhotos uploaded by the fire department, which later reminded people that using fireworks is banned in San Francisco, showed the vehicle in flames and later its charred remains.\n\nOfficers responded to the fire at about 8:50 p.m. local time, the police statement said. When the officers arrived, the unoccupied car was “engulfed in flames,” according to the statement, which added that there were no reports of injuries.\n\n“Chinatown is one of the densest neighborhoods in San Francisco, and any fire could explode and spread among tightly-packed buildings to endanger lives, homes and businesses,” she said in a statement Monday afternoon.\n\n“People could have been hurt and most importantly, this was the day of the Chinese Lunar New Year,” Peskin said. “This is one of the most important days for families, there were thousands and thousands of tourists here, partaking in the events.”\n\nA Waymo spokesperson told Reuters that the passenger-less car was moving along a street in Chinatown when people surrounded it. Later someone threw a firework inside, setting the fire, the company said.\n\nAlthough cars without drivers have become a common sight on San Francisco’s winding and sloping streets, there are long-standing tensions between the city’s residents and the cars.\n\nA Waymo vehicle struck a cyclist last week in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, resulting in minor injuries, the Verge reported. The Waymo passenger was unhurt, and the cyclist left the scene on their own.\n\nDriverless cars have caused major concerns in San Francisco by disrupting first responders on multiple occasions, including driving into scenes cordoned off by caution tape and striking a firetruck responding to an emergency, The Post previously reported.\n\nLast year, a robotaxi operated by Cruise — a Waymo rival — rolled over a pedestrian and dragged her about 20 feet, after which the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended its operations. Days later, the company said it would suspend all driverless operations in the country to examine its process and earn back public trust.\n\nIn four videos uploaded by witness Michael Vandi, who heads Addy AI, an AI company, a man who is using his jacket to cover his face can be seen scribbling on the back of the car with what appears to be a sharpie. Others in the crowd appear unmasked. An unidentified voice encourages others to light the vehicle on fire.\n\nOnce the car is set on fire, however, people appear to back away from the vehicle. The Post could not access footage of the moment when the firecracker was thrown inside the car.\n\nVandi told Reuters in a direct message on X, formerly Twitter, that people were celebrating the Lunar New Year on Saturday evening by setting off fireworks. He said he saw a person jump onto the hood of the vehicle and break its windshield, and another later jumped onto the hood as the crowd clapped. Vandi could not be reached for comment Monday morning.\n\n“That was when it went WILD,” he wrote. “There were 2 groups of people. Folks who encourage it - and others who were just shocked & started filming. No one stood up - i mean there wasn’t anything you could do to stand up to dozens of people.”",

  "text": "The account is run by Team Biden-Harris, the name for the reelection effort, and will be posting content regularly as it does on other social channels including Threads, Instagram, Facebook, X and Truth Social, according to campaign advisers.\n\n“Our Roman Empire is reaching voters wherever they are (did I do that right)?” said Rob Flaherty, deputy campaign manager for Biden’s reelection campaign. The phrase “Roman Empire” has become a meme that functions as shorthand for something a person cares deeply about and can’t stop thinking about.\n\nBiden’s team has leaned hard into memes in attempts to connect with young people. Biden’s avatar on TikTok features a black and white photo of the president with laser eyes, a style of image popularized by the “Dark Brandon” meme which portrays Biden as a no nonsense super hero schooled in the dark art of politics.\n\n“Young people around the country have been waiting for this moment,” said Aaron Parnas, a Gen Z political content creator. “The president is meeting us where we are, and we’ll help him with because of it.”\n\nBiden’s campaign said that they’re taking advanced safety precautions around their devices and incorporating a protocol to ensure security of the account. The campaign’s presence is independent from the ongoing review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government agency that’s tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns and has been negotiating with TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nThe White House has often used TikTok to spread messaging and has briefed TikTok creators on things such as the war in Ukraine, the president’s infrastructure initiatives, and the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, a group of TikTok creators spent an hour in the Oval Office in a private meeting with the president. The trip was organized by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in an attempt to leverage TikTok’s vast audience to influence the midterms. The DNC maintains an official TikTok account. Last December, the White House also hosted its first holiday party exclusively for content creators.\n\nTikTok has become a powerful tool for campaigning. In 2020, a collective of hundreds of content creators joined TikTok for Biden, a collaborative effort aimed at getting the president elected. And other lawmakers, such as Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), have made TikTok integral to their campaigning efforts. One of the most popular lawmakers on TikTok is Rep. Jeff Jackson (D-N. C.), who has amassed a following of over 2.5 million by posting regular videos about the top news.\n\n“Last election, there was still an open question: Could influencers move the needle on political campaigns?” Daniel Daks, founder of the talent management firm Palette, who helped organize the TikTok creators’ trip to Washington to meet Biden and former president Barack Obama, said last year. “It’s been answered pretty solidly with a yes.”\n\nLast year, The Washington Post reported that some Democrats worried the crackdown on TikTok could hurt the party’s ability to reach younger voters. “Ditching something that has proven to be incredibly helpful to winning elections is like shooting yourself in the foot,” said Aidan Kohn-Murphy, the founder of Gen-Z for Change, a coalition of creators formerly known as TikTok for Biden.\n\nHowever, more recently, many young TikTok creators have used the platform to be critical of Biden. They’ve railed against his policies on climate change, the war in Gaza and failure to contain the pandemic. Last year, many young activists attempted to leverage TikTok to get the Biden administration to stop the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. Their campaign was unsuccessful, however TikTok has remained a powerful political platform and hub for progressive activism.\n\nChristian Tom, director of the White House’s Office of Digital Strategy, told an audience of content creators and industry executives at VidCon Baltimore last year that, for the first time, there is a specific team at the White House dedicated to forging partnerships with content creators.\n\n“The work we do with creators has the most upside and potential of all the communications methods we employ,” Tom said. “Whether it’s spicy tweets from @WhiteHouse, or our work with creators, it’s about how we can find a way to appear in the feed in a way that feels authentic, organic and ultimately surprises you.”",

  "text": "Wrapping up a trip to Israel on Wednesday, Biden told reporters that up to 20 trucks of aid from Egypt would be allowed into the enclave through the Rafah border crossing once potholes along the road and damage from Israeli airstrikes had been repaired. Humanitarian officials warned, however, that a host of issues must still be resolved before the trucks can start moving.\n\n“The diplomats are way behind in responding to an exploding emergency,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general for the Norwegian Refugee Council. “You now need a cease fire and you need massive access across several crossing points, even to be close to responding to the most acute needs as the entire population is now destitute.”\n\nThe Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas, has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years, leaving most of its 2.3 million residents dependent on aid even before the current conflict. Those deliveries stopped entirely when Israeli and Egyptian border crossings into Gaza were closed after Hamas militants killed at least 1,400 people in a surprise assault on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7.\n\nAn initial aid delivery will ease the crisis, experts said, but only fleetingly. “What is needed is consistent and unimpeded aid access into and within Gaza, not only for the entry of and safe passage of supplies but also for humanitarians to be able to undertake their work safely,” said Emma Beals, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute who researches the distribution of aid in conflict zones.\n\n“We need more than just a promise that aid is allowed to go in,” Martin Griffiths, the emergency relief coordinator who oversees humanitarian aid at the United Nations, told The Washington Post on Wednesday. “Aid must go in at scale and daily.” U. N. Secretary General António Guterres echoed that point upon arriving in Cairo early Thursday, telling reporters he is seeking agreement on “sustained” humanitarian relief.\n\nBut U. S. officials were quick to describe the first trucks as a test balloon, with no guarantee of future deliveries if Hamas will interfere. “If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people,” Biden said, speaking aboard Air Force One as he departed Israel. “As a practical matter it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.”\n\nHumanitarian officials emphasized the United Nations has established monitoring mechanisms in place for aid that crosses into Gaza. The European Union also has an assistance mission that operates at the Rafah border crossing in Egypt and could be called upon to inspect the trucks upon entry. It was unclear Thursday whether these agencies had been contacted about helping to monitor the aid route.\n\nDiscussions on inspections were still “ongoing,” U. S. and U.N. officials told The Post on Thursday. News reports in Arab media and elsewhere that a deal had been reached were “premature,” one official said. Another said the talks are “close, but not there yet.” Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.\n\n“It is outrageous to hold back emergency relief for children, women and families because they fear aid diversion. Most of the stuff that goes in, the fighting men are well stocked on, they do not need bottled water or baby powder,” Egeland said, adding that existing monitoring mechanisms can and should be implemented without delay.\n\nMore than 100 aid trucks were lined up Thursday in the Egyptian city of Arish, waiting for a greenlight to move to Rafah. On the other side of the border, Palestinians struggled to understand why the initial deliveries would be so small or how they would actually reach people in Gaza.\n\nMohamed Zanoon, an independent photographer who was working to document the aftermath of the Israeli air raids, said he was witnessing a “humanitarian catastrophe.” He has struggled to push from his mind the memories of children screaming beneath the rubble. “Twenty trucks is not enough,” he said by phone. “More than a million people need medical care in Gaza.”\n\nAmong the thorniest remaining questions is whether fuel will be allowed on the trucks. Without its regular deliveries, the last power plant in Gaza went dark last week, robbing the enclave of regular electricity. Hospitals have since struggled to keep the lights on with diesel generators. Doctors warn a total blackout would be a death sentence for patients on life support, in the operating theater and to newborns in incubators.\n\nAs news of the impending deal filtered through Gaza, residents described the aid effort as a drop in the ocean, and they fretted over whether they would receive anything all. “Okay, it is something,” said Yousef Hammash, a father of two from Gaza City. “At least we have it. Now we have to have a truce to distribute it. How are they going to do it under bombardment?”\n\nGriffiths, from the United Nations, said humanitarian officials have been engaged in “incredibly detailed negotiations” about what an aid program to southern Gaza would look like. He said relief workers need assurances that they will be able to deliver aid consistently and reach people where they are “in the places that they choose to be safe.”\n\nFor many Palestinians, nowhere in Gaza feels safe. The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Wednesday that Israeli warplanes bombed five bakeries in different locations, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds as they lined up to buy bread. Medics and aid workers have also been killed off duty, sometimes as they left work to check on their families.\n\n“The streets are not safe, and the entire population is in need,” Hammash said. “Every day we have to do our challenging mission of getting bread and water.” He moved his family from Gaza City to Khan Younis this week after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of over 1 million civilians in the northern part of the enclave. But the mass displacement has put such strain on resources in the south that Hammash said some people were now heading back home. “Either you get bombed in the north or you die from hunger here,” he said.",

  "text": "The shape of the next Israel-Gaza relationship may depend, among other factors, on what’s left of Hamas, and Gaza, when the fighting stops. Already, Israel’s air attacks have killed more than 2,600, according to Palestinian authorities, and begun to decimate public infrastructure.\n\nAs the shock wave from a Hamas rampage that killed 1,400 Israelis has swept away old assumptions, scenarios that seemed impossible just days ago could be in play: Israel reoccupying Gaza, at least temporarily; the return of the Palestinian Authority to the enclave; international peacekeepers; a demilitarized Hamas still technically holding government authority.\n\n“We need to see how long it will take to destroy Hamas. And then I believe there will be an international understanding with Israel for the day after,” Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel said in an interview. “But now we need to put all our power into winning this war.”\n\nThe Israeli public is widely and furiously behind that goal, for now. “Destroy Gaza,” reads a banner hanging over a highway in the left-leaning city of Tel Aviv. But past wars suggest the mood could shift — and international support could wane — if the expected ground war drags on and produces horrifying body counts.\n\nIsrael’s military is more circumspect than its leading politicians have been. The Israel Defense Forces said they are gathering tanks and troops — one of the largest mobilizations in the country’s history — with an operational goal of defeating Hamas and eliminating all senior officials involved. This would amount to a greatly expanded version of previous war aims, in which the IDF pulled out once it completed a target list meant to degrade Hamas’s military capabilities.\n\nEven if Israel does kill every Hamas leader in Gaza and collapse every tunnel, “destroying” the organization may not be possible, experts said. Hamas has leaders who are exiled but active and known to move around between Beirut, Istanbul and Doha, Qatar. And Hamas supporters can be found not just in Gaza but also throughout the West Bank, and elsewhere.\n\nIsrael is not willing to sacrifice any more of its soldiers’ lives than is necessary, said Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. After what could be a brutal invasion, staying in Gaza to govern will have no appeal.\n\nA restoration of the authority, which is already viewed by many Palestinians as a corrupt agent of Israeli security agencies, would need to be carefully managed, he said. Its legitimacy would take another blow if Israel is seen as simply ushering in Palestinian Authority security forces when the IDF is ready to leave.\n\nSome analysts said the recent thaw in Israel’s relations with Arab states could provide a way. Before the Hamas attack, Saudi Arabia was talking to the Biden administration about establishing ties with Israel. It’s possible that Riyadh could play a role in brokering the Palestinian Authority’s arrival in Gaza City.\n\nBut the willingness of Persian Gulf states, and other governments, to help Israel craft an endgame may depend on how the Gaza war concludes. The world was shocked by Hamas’s brutality, but experience shows that civilian casualties and humanitarian agony in Gaza will erode public support.",

  "text": "The Gaza Strip’s health-care system stands on the brink of collapse as bombings damage hospitals and ambulances and as generators run out of fuel, highlighting how quality medical care is a casualty of war. Dire scenarios await Gaza’s medical professionals. They face dwindling basic resources such as power, water and anesthesia, compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save. The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health-care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human-made and natural disasters — assessing staffing and other resources, managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones, and looking out for their own welfare.\n\n“When we are in a disaster setting or conflict, we usually have more patients than resources. We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people,” said Lindsey Ryan Martin, who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza.\n\n“Health workers, why would they stay?” Griffiths said. “And how can you move the sick people that we’ve already been discussing for the last few days, coming out of the hospital in Gaza City — how can you move them when they’re in ICUs?”\n\nAn anesthesia specialist at al-Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed. He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene: patients being treated on a teal floor, a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient.\n\nThe hospital worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters, worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply. He’s already seeing infections, diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children.\n\nThe hospital worker said he last slept properly on Oct. 5, before the conflict began, and doesn’t know whether his home is still standing. “It’s also the last time I saw my wife and my kids,” he said.\n\nErica L. Nelson, who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years, said Palestinian doctors at al-Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted. “The additional component of ‘We are at risk’ has changed the tenor of the conversation,” said Nelson, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply. Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities “extremely dangerous,” according to Doctors Without Borders, which has staff on the ground in Gaza. The U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients. All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel.\n\n“When fuel runs out, that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that don’t require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services,” said John Broach, director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester, Mass.\n\nBroach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated, such as people with well-managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies.\n\n“Soon all the team is burned out, their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions,” said Callaway, who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine.\n\nThe decisions health-care workers face in disasters are momentous: As they focus on the patient in front of them, they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere. “You feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment,” Callaway said. “Is a kid’s life more valuable than an elderly person’s?”\n\nResources simply were not available to treat everyone in need, he said. “You can be forced into a situation where you can’t do what’s best for your patient, either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die,” Kirsch said.\n\nPaul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do. As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide, Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could, amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures. “You have no choice,” he said. “You tell yourself you’ll probably do it better than a layperson.”\n\nThe health-care system in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, already struggled before the war. The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods, which can restrict care. Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014, when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50-day Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

  "text": "“You can die anywhere here,” Maha said in a phone interview, speaking on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her safety. “But if they’re telling us to leave, that means they are going to be doing bad things to people.”\n\nThe unprecedented Israeli evacuation order, delivered Friday by fliers, voice messages and on social media, has set off a desperate and chaotic scramble across this besieged territory. Israel has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza since Saturday, and they are still falling, even as hundreds of thousands of people try to move south.\n\n“In the following days, the IDF will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City,” the Israel Defense Forces said Friday, adding that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels beneath civilian homes and in heavily populated areas. “Civilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields.”\n\nJames Elder, spokesman for UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, described agonizing conversations with staff members in northern Gaza: “The word ‘impossible’ was used so many times, in terms of, ‘It’s impossible for us to do this, they are asking the impossible.’ I was talking to people through tears. These are resilient people who have been through a lot but are absolutely out of options.”\n\nA 33-year-old woman in Gaza City, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity for her safety, is staying with some 50 members of her family, including her elderly mother and father. She doesn’t know how they could leave, even if she could find a vehicle.\n\nIsrael sealed its land borders with Gaza after Hamas’s attack Saturday, and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt — the last remaining exit — has been closed for days after Israeli strikes in the area. When it does reopen, only a small number of Gazans are likely to be able to cross to safety.\n\n“People have been calling me all morning asking if I can help them find a place to stay,” said Wesam Amer, a university lecturer who lives in Khan Younis and is already hosting extended family members. He doesn’t know of a single building in the area that has space for more. And the people keep coming.\n\nInside the hospital, doctors say they are running out of resources and fear they could soon be plunged into darkness. Israel has imposed a total siege on Gaza, cutting electricity and deliveries of fuel. Health officials say al-Shifa only has three more days’ worth of generator fuel; other Gaza hospitals could be out within a week.",

  "text": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden’s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country’s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza’s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael’s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n“We all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,” Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. “They go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid.",

  "text": "Eli Lilly filed a complaint with the U. S. International Trade Commission on Thursday to block companies from importing and selling cheaper versions of its blockbuster drug Mounjaro online, accusing them of misleading and endangering American consumers seeking to lose weight.Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.The Indiana-based drugmaker accused 11 companies of importing products that they say contain tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro, while falsely implying that their products are associated with Eli Lilly or approved by the Food and Drug Administration. One company selling tirzepatide online advertises that its product has a purity greater than 99 percent; however, according to Eli Lilly, it is actually just sugar alcohol.\n\nBy suggesting that their products are equivalent to FDA-approved Mounjaro, Eli Lilly says, the companies are cutting into its sales and engaging in conduct “gravely dangerous to consumers who unknowingly inject themselves with research chemicals not designed or intended for use in humans.”\n\nEli Lilly’s complaint is the latest legal battle over sensationally popular medications that treat diabetes and also suppress appetite, helping people achieve unprecedented degrees of weight loss with once-a-week injections. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, have also sued compounding pharmacies and med spas that make and market off-brand versions of their FDA-approved drugs.\n\nThe complaint to the trade commission, however, targets companies that sell their compounds directly to consumers online, often without a prescription that would be required for Mounjaro and other FDA-approved drugs. Eli Lilly is seeking an order from the federal agency that would bar all imports of products that violate fair trade provisions, such as the infringing of its trademark, as well as cease-and-desist orders to the individual companies it has targeted.\n\nAn examination by The Washington Post found more than two dozen websites selling tirzepatide or semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic — that generally say they are for research use only. One website refers to this as a “disclaimer to stay in business.” The operator of another site openly acknowledged selling them to people, saying the products were safe.\n\nEli Lilly targeted companies that it says import their products from overseas, selling them for about a tenth of Mounjaro’s $1,000 list price for a month’s supply. The firms can undercut Eli Lilly on pricing, the drugmaker says, “by using cheaper foreign labor and inferior ingredients and processes.” At the same time, Eli Lilly argues, the companies are effectively piggybacking on Eli Lilly’s research and development of Mounjaro by referencing the drug by name, referring to its FDA approval or citing Lilly’s clinical trials. These factors, coupled with the ease of buying the imitation products online, cause “substantial injury to Lilly’s domestic industry,” the company says.\n\nIn one example, Lilly cites a Chinese company doing business as AustroPeptide that sells tirzepatide online. Although the website doesn’t mention the FDA, Lilly argues that AustroPeptide’s description of the compound is “intended to mislead a purchaser into believing” that its products “have been approved by FDA for human drug use when they have not.” Lilly’s own testing found that the product “did not contain any tirzepatide” but was instead consistent with a common sugar alcohol, according to the complaint.\n\nEli Lilly brought in more than $1.4 billion from selling Mounjaro in the United States for the first half of 2023, according to its financial statements. Mounjaro, as well as Eli Lilly’s other weight-loss prospects in development, have helped boost its stock price by 60 percent so far this year, giving it a stock-market value of about $560 billion — the biggest of any U. S. pharmaceutical firm, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nMounjaro, Ozempic and Wegovy have proved so popular that their manufacturers haven’t been able to keep up with demand, leading the FDA to declare the drugs in short supply. That designation has opened the door for compounding pharmacies to mix up versions of the FDA-approved drugs, giving rise to an industry built on selling the off-brand versions cheaply.\n\nEli Lilly emphasized in the complaint that it has invested heavily in expanding capacity to make Mounjaro. As of Thursday, all dosages of the drug were listed as available on FDA’s drug shortage database, though the agency hasn’t yet removed it from the list.\n\n“We don’t resolve a shortage until the national demand is being met, which includes the firm being able to fill all orders, with no back-orders and safety stock built up in reserve to prevent further intermittent back-orders,” an FDA spokesperson said.",

  "text": "The Gaza Strip’s health-care system stands on the brink of collapse as bombings damage hospitals and ambulances and as generators run out of fuel, highlighting how quality medical care is a casualty of war. Dire scenarios await Gaza’s medical professionals. They face dwindling basic resources such as power, water and anesthesia, compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save. The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health-care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human-made and natural disasters — assessing staffing and other resources, managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones, and looking out for their own welfare.\n\n“When we are in a disaster setting or conflict, we usually have more patients than resources. We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people,” said Lindsey Ryan Martin, who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza.\n\n“Health workers, why would they stay?” Griffiths said. “And how can you move the sick people that we’ve already been discussing for the last few days, coming out of the hospital in Gaza City — how can you move them when they’re in ICUs?”\n\nAn anesthesia specialist at al-Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed. He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene: patients being treated on a teal floor, a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient.\n\nThe hospital worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters, worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply. He’s already seeing infections, diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children.\n\nThe hospital worker said he last slept properly on Oct. 5, before the conflict began, and doesn’t know whether his home is still standing. “It’s also the last time I saw my wife and my kids,” he said.\n\nErica L. Nelson, who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years, said Palestinian doctors at al-Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted. “The additional component of ‘We are at risk’ has changed the tenor of the conversation,” said Nelson, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply. Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities “extremely dangerous,” according to Doctors Without Borders, which has staff on the ground in Gaza. The U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients. All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel.\n\n“When fuel runs out, that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that don’t require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services,” said John Broach, director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester, Mass.\n\nBroach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated, such as people with well-managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies.\n\n“Soon all the team is burned out, their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions,” said Callaway, who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine.\n\nThe decisions health-care workers face in disasters are momentous: As they focus on the patient in front of them, they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere. “You feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment,” Callaway said. “Is a kid’s life more valuable than an elderly person’s?”\n\nResources simply were not available to treat everyone in need, he said. “You can be forced into a situation where you can’t do what’s best for your patient, either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die,” Kirsch said.\n\nPaul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do. As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide, Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could, amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures. “You have no choice,” he said. “You tell yourself you’ll probably do it better than a layperson.”\n\nThe health-care system in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, already struggled before the war. The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods, which can restrict care. Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014, when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50-day Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

  "text": "Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the conference’s current speaker-designate, has lost two votes on the House floor in his effort to clinch the gavel. On Thursday, he agreed to support a resolution that would have empowered Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick T. McHenry (R-N. C.) to temporarily perform the functions of speaker until Jan. 3, 2024. Doing so would have allowed Jordan to remain the conference’s nominee for speaker, try to corral support back into his corner and call up a vote for his speaker candidacy once he had the necessary 217 Republican votes.\n\n“We made the pitch to members on the resolution as a way to lower the temperature and get back to work. We decided that wasn’t where we’re going to go,” Jordan said. “I’m still running for speaker, and I plan to go to the floor and get the votes and win this race. But I want to go talk with a few of my colleagues.”\n\nLater Thursday, Jordan, McCarthy, McHenry and Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), a key ally, met with 12 of the holdouts in what became an airing of grievances, according to two people familiar with the meeting who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting. No one’s mind was changed into supporting Jordan, and Jordan did not react when members pressed it would be best if he stepped aside.\n\nHe announced his decision to the Republican conference Thursday morning in a closed meeting, but the proposal was quickly rejected. Some Republicans wanted to put the resolution up for a vote on the House floor only if a majority of them approved it in conference. Another group wanted Jordan to drop out before getting behind the resolution.\n\nMcCarthy endorsed the resolution to empower McHenry, his close friend who he tapped as Speaker Pro Tempore using a post-9/11 rule to ensure the continuity of government. But he was pressed by Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Tex.) about whether Jordan should be a statesman like him and Scalise, two Republican leaders who stepped aside when they realized they did not have enough support to continue running for speaker.\n\nHowever, Republican lawmakers have pointed out a key difference between McCarthy and Jordan’s candidacies for speaker: McCarthy’s tally continued to improve throughout the rounds of voting, and he had strong relationships as he has raised millions of dollars for many members’ victories. Jordan’s tally probably will continue to get worse, and he has few alliances outside his far-right coalition.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who orchestrated McCarthy’s ouster, spoke up against the resolution and suggested that Jordan holdouts should as well because it would give lawmakers time to whip opponents of Jordan into shape, according to several people in the room. The threat did not land well with lawmakers, particularly those who have received death threats since voting against Jordan.\n\nFurthermore, if Jordan remains the Republican designee for speaker and he continues to try to win, Democrats can still use him as a foil and paint the entire party as extremists whose leader is an election denier. Jordan is a key ally to former president Donald Trump and his effort to overturn the 2020 election. He also rejected a subpoena from the congressional panel tasked with investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U. S. Capitol.",

  "text": "The Biden administration is preparing for the possibility that hundreds of thousands of American citizens will require evacuation from the Middle East if the bloodshed in Gaza cannot be contained, according to four officials familiar with the U. S. government’s contingency planning.Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.The specter of such an operation comes as Israeli forces, aided by U.S. weapons and military advisers, prepare for what is widely expected to be a perilous ground offensive against Hamas militants responsible for the stunning cross-border attack that has reignited hostilities. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail internal deliberations, said Americans living in Israel and neighboring Lebanon are of particular concern, though they stressed that an evacuation of that magnitude is considered a worst-case scenario and that other outcomes are seen as more likely.\n\nThe administration, despite its forceful public support for Israel, is deeply alarmed by the prospect of escalation, and in recent days it has turned its attention in part to the complicated logistics of abruptly having to relocate a large number of people, according to three people familiar with the discussions. There were about 600,000 U. S. citizens in Israel and another 86,000 believed to be in Lebanon when Hamas attacked, according to State Department estimates.\n\nThe concern in Lebanon is chiefly over Hezbollah, a political party and militant group that, along with allies, currently controls the largest number of parliamentary seats. It entered parliament in 1992. It has long accepted training and weapons from Iran, prompting concerns that it could attack Israel from the north, creating a two-front war that would stretch Israeli forces. Already, there have been skirmishes along their shared border.\n\n“This has become a real issue,” one official said. “The administration is very, very, very worried that this thing is going to get out of hand.”\n\nThe administration’s concern extends beyond those two countries, as officials watch the street protests that have spread across the Arab world, putting both U. S. personnel and citizens in the region at heightened risk. The bombardment of Gaza has inflamed regional fury at Israel and its treatment of Palestinians — an issue some officials believed no longer carried as much importance in the Arab world.\n\n“We were told for the last 10 years that the Arab world and Muslim world didn’t care about Palestine anymore, and Abraham Accords were proof of that,” Riedel added, referring to agreements, signed by the governments of Sudan, Morocco, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, aimed at normalizing relations with Israel. “Well, Palestine has come back. I don’t think it ever went away.”\n\nTop U. S. officials have not wanted to discuss such contingency planning in public, hoping to avoid setting off a panic among Americans in the region. But their posture has shifted in recent days to convey the anxiety about other actors entering the conflict.\n\nLast week, the State Department issued an advisory to all U. S. citizens worldwide “to exercise increased caution” due to “increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, [and] demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests.”\n\nDepending on the scale of a potential U. S. evacuation, it could be more difficult than any previous operations in recent memory, experts said. It could involve Air Force aircraft or Navy warships, which have surged to the region this month.\n\n“With 600,000 Americans in Israel and threats to other Americans across the region, it’s hard to think of an evacuation that might compare to this in scale, scope and complexity,” said Suzanne Maloney, the director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.\n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon signaled, too, that it is bracing for a significant increase in attacks on U. S. troops in the Middle East, and the department singled out Iran for its extensive sponsorship of militant groups with a long history of using rockets and drones to target American military positions. In response, Pentagon officials said, they are surging additional missile-defense systems to the region.\n\nParticularly vulnerable are the estimated 3,400 troops deployed in Iraq and Syria, where earlier in the day U. S. personnel based near the Jordan border intercepted at least two one-way attack drones, officials said. Americans operating in those countries have been targeted for years by Iranian-backed militias, including Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraq-based group that claimed responsibility for some of the previous attacks disclosed over the last week.\n\n“We don’t necessarily see that Iran has explicitly ordered them to take these kinds of attacks,” Ryder said. “That said, by virtue of the fact that they are supported by Iran, we will ultimately hold Iran responsible.”\n\nIt’s unclear how many times deployed personnel have come under fire since the Israel-Hamas crisis began Oct. 7. Officials said that the Pentagon was compiling a list of confirmed incidents but that the effort had been hampered by what one senior defense official called the profusion of “disinformation and misinformation.”\n\nNo U. S. personnel are known to have been killed or seriously injured in any of the spillover violence. An American contractor in Iraq did suffer a fatal heart attack last week as troops and others at the Ain al-Asad air base raced to take cover from what proved to be a false alarm of an incoming attack.",

  "text": "I get it. Life here is great, minor inconveniences notwithstanding. And it’s easy to find yourself down a fantasy real estate rabbit hole. Just like in the United States, houses for sale in Europe are listed on websites — for instance, Seloger in France, Fotocasa in Spain and Immobiliare in Italy — sometimes with appealing prices. But the process of actually buying one can get complicated quickly. Here’s where the experts say you should start.\n\nThe first clash between dreams and reality will come at the immigration office. Americans without an additional citizenship in a European country can only stay in the Schengen Area — a collection of countries that covers most of Europe — for 90 days in any 180-day period. Unless you’re planning to buy a home only for vacations (more on that later), you’ll need a visa.\n\nEven though there are some commonalities and agreements between governments, “each country has different laws, each country has different ways of doing business,” says Zola Szerencses, chair of the Certified International Property Specialists advisory group within the National Association of Realtors. The type of visa, its duration and the qualifications to get it vary as you cross borders, and some countries (like Switzerland) may have restrictions on where foreign nationals without certain visas can buy homes.\n\nWhat will be constant, however, are deadlines to turn in documents. Depending on the visa you’re seeking, you might need anything including birth and marriage certificates, a work contract and proof of a clean criminal record. “You have to not only just find these documents, but you have to get a new one printed from the state or the town and then have them send it off to get certified. And it’s just such a nightmare,” says Melissa Hughes, who bought an apartment in Spain in 2019. So, knowing what’s required ahead of time is key.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors has a database of internationally certified real estate agents listed by their location and countries of specialization. (Realtors certified to work abroad are identified by the letters CIPS.) Working with a U. S.-based agent who has expertise in your preferred country lets you “expect the same level of services and the same level of understanding,” as you’d get buying domestically, Szerencses says.\n\n“You cannot see everything in the picture,” Neill says. And not everyone stages homes in the way American buyers are used to — so, some international listings will require more imagination to grasp their full potential. “The first house I sold on my own [in France], that’s what I did: flowers, soft music, soft lighting, some bread baking and the house sold on the first visit,” he says. “But it’s extremely rare. It’s not done here.”\n\nOnce you find a place you like, the next step is usually financing (if you plan on buying in cash, you should research the property and wealth taxes in your new country … but then again, if you’re able to buy in cash you probably know how to navigate tax laws already). In certain newer developments, which Szerencses says are sometimes built specifically to cater to expats, financing is sometimes managed through the developer. Generally, though, a mortgage requires getting a broker and a bank. As in the United States, your international real estate agent can probably point you toward a mortgage broker and help set up a local bank account.\n\nLike visa requirements, the regulations around loans and bank accounts vary from country to country. Neill says in France, monthly income is more important than total wealth for most buyers to get approved for a mortgage. “You have people who’ve left their job, sold the house and moved … and they say, ‘you know, we’ve got a bag of money,’ but that in itself is not the way the system works here,” he says.\n\nWhen making the final purchase, lawyers and additional fees may also be required. In many countries, a notary will manage the sale, often for both parties, including overseeing the contracts and checking for liens. In France, for example, Neill says the notary fees can be about 7.5 percent of the sale price, though that includes taxes. The precise details of these fees will vary by country and agency — this is another area where an agent can offer location-specific guidance to avoid unwelcome surprises.\n\nJust like in the United States, the spending won’t stop after you sign the paperwork. You’ll need to pay taxes in two countries. The insurance you need will vary from region to region, and there are qualifications to get into national health systems. If you plan to hire workers to maintain your home when you’re not there, check the rates because labor can be more expensive in other countries. And if you aim to rent your European home, make sure you’ll be allowed to under local regulations before you buy.\n\nBefore planning an international purchase or move, it’s worth asking a few questions of yourself, too. “Over the years, I've had many people passing through and saying they were thinking of buying something, and the question I always ask them is how much time do they really want to spend there,” says Catherine Severo, my wife’s cousin who had a home in France for years and was a helpful guide for my own move. “Because owning a property is like owning a property in the States; you have to make sure the bills get paid, the grass gets cut, the rooms get painted.”\n\nThe romantic vision of expat life usually doesn’t include comparison shopping for vacuums or sitting with a dictionary and list of rules for how to set out paper recycling. But it’s worth taking the time to find out whether your desire for adventure can outlast the drudgery. “Come across for three months,” Neill advises. “Live with us.”",

Two of her children have been taken hostage by Hamas. (Ofir Berman for The Washington Post) TEL AVIV — At 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 7, Hadas Kalderon received the last message from her son.“Mom, be quiet, don’t move,” Erez, 12, texted. Hamas militants had stormed his father’s house, in their southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Oz, where he and his 16-year-old sister, Sahar, had spent the night. Erez and his sister had jumped out the window and were hiding in the bushes. But he was thinking of his mother, just down the road, trying to protect her. Gunmen were rampaging through their tiny pastoral community, shooting entire families, some at point-blank range, as they clung to each other in beds and safe rooms.“I love you forever. I hope you survive,” she texted back. There was no reply.For hours, Hadas called Erez’s cellphone again and again, even as she fought for her life, physically blocking militants from breaking down her safe room door. She heard them screaming, “Allahu akbar” as they set fire to parts of her home.When Israeli forces finally arrived in the late afternoon, the Kalderon family emerged from hiding, and Hadas’s older daughter found an 18-second video circulating on social media. It showed Erez in a black T-shirt, being gripped by both arms and led into captivity. The militants referred to Erez and another group of children who do not appear in the shot as “child settlers.”Kalderon has replaced eating and sleeping with chain-smoking. Her voice is raw from overuse. She is in a “living hell,” she said, having told her children for years not to be afraid. Now, “the nightmare has come true.”Five members of the family were taken, including Erez, Sahar and their 50-year-old father, Ofer; their 80-year-old grandmother, Carmela, and a 12-year-old cousin, Noya, were grabbed from another house in the community. There are 203 people being held hostage in Gaza, according to the Israeli government, including civilians with passports from at least 31 other countries.Hadas’s childhood friend from Nir Oz, whose relatives are also being held in Gaza, has commandeered her cellphone, shielding her from the relentless, looping horrors on social media — the celebrations of the bloodshed, the parading of humiliated captives, some stripped down to their underwear, others huddled together in what could be Hamas’s vast network of tunnels. In one case, militants uploaded a video showing the killing of an elderly woman to her own Facebook page. Her granddaughter discovered it.The militants’ decision to film their reign of terror has deepened the anguish of Israelis, but it has also given experts in Israel’s vaunted cybersecurity and intelligence sectors a great deal of evidence to work with. They are leading a grass-roots effort now to comb through the footage and the photographs for clues about where hostages are being held.“The state has the tools and the information, but they don’t have the apparatus to work as quickly as we do,” said Ido Har-Tuv, a former member of Shin Bet, Israel’s secretive national security service, and the chief executive of Gitam BBDO — an advertising agency that has opened a makeshift “war room” out of its offices in a gleaming high-rise in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hahayal, Israel’s Silicon Valley.“We’re running our operation here like a lean, efficient start-up,” Har-Tuv said. “We don’t have time.”Many of the roughly 100 men and women in the “war room” have deep military and intelligence experience, and some are being called up by Israel’s most elite units. They include 8200, the Israeli military’s cyberintelligence division, and Duvdevan, its undercover counterterrorism unit, which was the basis for the Netflix series “Fauda.”Refael Franco, the former deputy head of the National Cyber Directorate, is overseeing the construction of the group’s platform, which is based on cutting-edge AI and facial recognition technology. It is a sophisticated system that cross-checks images posted by militants posted on social media against photos of the hostages provided by families. When a match occurs, the system can geolocate — within seconds — the approximate location of a missing person. Open-source intelligence experts then try to zero in further, relying on contextual clues like mosques, local shops or the angle of the sun.The teams have already built a database of an estimated 1,000 people, including hostages and hostage takers. They are getting personnel and logistical help from Google, which has offices across town. They have shared their platform with Israeli security officials, who will use it to further their own search.Hamas took at least 64 captives into Gaza, visual evidence suggestsBut it is a time-consuming and inexact process. One of the biggest challenges, Franco said, is that hostages have been moved repeatedly.“That being said, every time someone picks up their phone and uploads footage in the strip, we can cross-check it in the system to know where they are,” he said. They will keep following the digital clues, he said, for “as long as this mission takes.”Most of the videos were filmed and posted during or shortly after the initial abductions, flooding social media sites such as Telegram, Facebook, Snapchat and X, formerly known as Twitter — oftentimes all at once. Many were easy to find because they were posted with the same set of hashtags. In rare instances, Palestinian gunmen could be heard discussing where to take their captives.One set of videos, believed to be filmed by militants and passersby in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, showed a hostage being led by gunmen; on a wall in the background was a phone number of a local businessman, tipping off the team to the neighborhood.“We’re figuring all of this out as we go,” said one volunteer, among a group hunched over their laptops as they toggled through spreadsheets filled with translated posts, hashtags and geolocations.The man spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a reservist with Duvdevan. As time goes on, he said, the militants are posting less and, when they do, they are focusing more on themselves and their injuries.And as Israel expands its punishing air campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 3,700 people, hostage takers may lose electricity or cell reception and go dark entirely.Kalderon has not turned on the news since the attack. All she knows is that 80 of her 400 neighbors are dead or missing. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.She was unaware of the grass-roots efforts to locate the hostages, but she was not surprised. Across Israel, civilians have mobilized to provide aid to victims in the south and equipment to the troops, filling gaps left by the government.For a week and a half, Kalderon and her relatives heard nothing from Israeli officials about the status of their loved ones, or efforts to bring them home.On Wednesday, a military notification officer told Kalderon that her mother, Carmela — a peacenik immigrant from New York who for years helped Gazans receive medical treatment in Israel — and her autistic niece Noya — who was sleeping over at her grandmother’s — were both dead. There was no information about the others.Kalderon and other relatives of hostages say have they experienced a double trauma: first left to fend for themselves when militants overran their communities, now left to navigate a deafening silence from their government.“Every second, every second, that our children are there is one second too much, and yet all Netanyahu talks about is ‘winning the war,’” said Kalderon, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.He has met with only a handful of families — days after President Biden and members of his administration first reached out to them — and has provided few assurances.Kalderon, who also holds French citizenship, has met with French diplomats, including former prime minister Manuel Valls. But she is terrified that her own government, in preparing for a full-scale invasion of Gaza, may cast her children off as collateral damage.“We are simple people; we are good citizens,” she said. “We gave whatever we could to our country. It’s the Israeli government that just forgot us.”Israel-Gaza war: Israel’s military said it rescued two hostages from the southern Gazan city of Rafah while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza’s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing political pressure to reach a hostage release deal, after rejecting a cease-fire and vowing to continue war.Middle East conflict: Tensions in the region continue to rise. As Israeli troops aim to take control of the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, officials in Cairo warn it would undermine the 1979 peace treaty. Meanwhile, there’s a diplomatic scramble to avert full-scale war between Israel and Lebanon.U.S. involvement: U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria killed dozens of Iranian-linked militants, according to Iraqi officials. The strikes were the first round of retaliatory action by the Biden administration for an attack in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops.Middle East conflict live updates: Biden urges civilian safety plan in Rafah as Jordan’s king calls for cease-fireMiddle East conflict live updates: Biden urges civilian safety plan in Rafah as Jordan’s king calls for cease-fireBiden and Jordanian king warn about planned Israeli invasion of RafahBiden and Jordanian king warn about planned Israeli invasion of RafahPanic mounts in Rafah over looming Israeli offensive after night strikesPanic mounts in Rafah over looming Israeli offensive after night strikes",

  "text": "JERUSALEM — Hamas released two American hostages on Friday, U. S. and Israeli officials said, the first of the at least 200 captives the militant group has held since it rampaged through Israeli towns two weeks ago.The mother and daughter, released to the Red Cross in Gaza, were transferred to an Israeli military team and escorted to an army base in Israel to be reunited with their family members, officials said.\n\nThe pair, identified as Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie Raanan, of Evanston, Ill., were in Israel to visit family when they were kidnapped from Nahal Oz, a kibbutz not far from the border fence breached by Hamas fighters. The group said it released them at the request of Qatari mediators for “humanitarian reasons.”\n\nUntil Friday, Hamas had ignored demands from Israel and pleas from Western governments to free the captives, many of whom are children, ill or elderly. Israel has said it would not allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza through its territory until the hostages were freed. Human rights groups have said taking civilian hostages is an unambiguous war crime. President Biden has called Hamas’s actions “pure evil.”\n\nBiden, who asked Congress on Friday to authorize a sweeping aid package for Israel, said U. S. officials and their allies were “working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas.” He pledged to continue pushing for the release of all still being held.\n\n“Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nInside the Palestinian enclave, a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding: Nearly 2 million people have been cut off from food, water, fuel and medicine as they weather a relentless Israeli bombing campaign. Hospitals faced with dire shortages were on “the brink of collapse,” the United Nations reported.\n\nBiden, who said this week that Israel and Egypt had assured him they would allow the aid trucks to pass, announced Friday that the crossing would open “in the next 24 to 48 hours.”\n\nElsewhere along the border, the Israeli military was massing troops and armored vehicles in preparation for the anticipated ground invasion of the densely populated territory. The operation would involve heavy urban combat and almost certainly would lead to an escalation in civilian casualties, analysts said.\n\nAs Israel prepared for a ground war, and besieged bystanders braced for its likely consequences, Amnesty International said it had found “damning evidence” of Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Amnesty investigators said Israeli attacks have destroyed block after block of residential buildings and critical infrastructure and caused “mass civilian casualties.”\n\nFrom Egypt to Indonesia and in several American cities, demonstrators again took to the streets, shouting down Israel and its allies, especially the United States, and demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed 4,137 people in Gaza and wounded more than 13,200, Palestinian officials say. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli officials say. Hamas, rampaging through villages and kibbutz settlements, took more than 200 people hostage.\n\nTen Americans remained unaccounted for, Blinken said, and authorities knew that Hamas was holding at least some of them hostage. Diplomats were working feverishly to secure their release, Blinken said. He declined to share further details.\n\nThe Raanans’ release spurred more urgent calls for the remaining hostages to be set free. The Hostages and Missing Families forum, a group in Israel, sought to pressure Arab leaders in the region to work to return their loved ones safely.\n\nA spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli authorities “will continue to operate with the best of their abilities and efforts in order to locate all of the missing and return all of the abductees home.”",

  "text": "CDC officials acknowledged in internal discussions and in a briefing last week with state health officials how much the covid-19 landscape has changed since the virus emerged four years ago, killing nearly 1.2 million people in the United States and shuttering businesses and schools. The new reality — with most people having developed a level of immunity to the virus because of prior infection or vaccination — warrants a shift to a more practical approach, experts and health officials say.\n\n“Public health has to be realistic,” said Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Minnesota. “In making recommendations to the public today, we have to try to get the most out of what people are willing to do. … You can be absolutely right in the science and yet accomplish nothing because no one will listen to you.”\n\nThe CDC plans to recommend that people who test positive for the coronavirus use clinical symptoms to determine when to end isolation. Under the new approach, people would no longer need to stay home if they have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the aid of medication and their symptoms are mild and improving, according to three agency officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions.\n\nThe federal recommendations follow similar moves by Oregon and California. The White House has yet to sign off on the guidance that the agency is expected to release in April for public feedback, officials said. One agency official said the timing could “move around a bit” until the guidance is finalized.\n\nOfficials said they recognized the need to give the public more practical guidelines for covid-19, acknowledging that few people are following isolation guidance that hasn’t been updated since December 2021. Back then, health officials cut the recommended isolation period for people with asymptomatic coronavirus from 10 days to five because they worried essential services would be hobbled as the highly transmissible omicron variant sent infections surging. The decision was hailed by business groups and slammed by some union leaders and health experts.\n\nPublic health officials should treat covid differently from other respiratory viruses, she said, because it’s deadlier than the flu and increases the risk of developing long-term complications. As many as 7 percent of Americans report having suffered from a slew of lingering covid symptoms, including fatigue, difficulty breathing, brain fog, joint pain and ongoing loss of taste and smell, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile the coronavirus continues to cause serious illness, especially among the most vulnerable people, vaccines and effective treatments such as Paxlovid are available. The latest versions of coronavirus vaccines were 54 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infection in adults, according to data released Feb. 1, the first U. S. study to assess how well the shots work against the most recent coronavirus variant. But CDC data shows only 22 percent of adults and 12 percent of children had received the updated vaccine as of Feb. 9, despite data showing the vaccines provide robust protection against serious illness.\n\nCoronavirus levels in wastewater indicate that symptomatic and asymptomatic infections remain high. About 20,000 people are still hospitalized — and about 2,300 are dying — every week, CDC data show. But the numbers are falling and are much lower than when deaths peaked in January 2021 when almost 26,000 people died of covid each week and about 115,000 were hospitalized.\n\nCalifornia’s state epidemiologist Erica Pan said the societal disruptions that resulted from strict isolation guidelines also helped spur the change. Workers without sick leave and those who can’t work from home if they or their children test positive and are required to isolate bore a disproportionate burden. Strict isolation requirements can act as a disincentive to test when testing should be encouraged so people at risk for serious illness can get treatment, she said.\n\nGiving people symptom-based guidance, similar to what is already recommended for flu, is a better way to prioritize those most at risk and balance the potential for disruptive impacts on schools and workplaces, Pan said. After Oregon made its change, the state has not experienced any disproportionate increases in community transmission or severity, according to data shared last month with the national association representing state health officials.\n\nCalifornia still recommends people with covid wear masks indoors when they are around others for 10 days after testing positive — even if they have no symptoms — or becoming sick. “You may remove your mask sooner than 10 days if you have two sequential negative tests at least one day apart,” the California guidance states.\n\nHealth officials from other states told the CDC last week that they are already moving toward isolation guidelines that would treat the coronavirus the same as flu and RSV, with additional precautions for people at high risk, said Anne Zink, an emergency room physician and Alaska’s chief medical officer.\n\nMany other countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Australia, made changes to isolation recommendations in 2022. Of 16 countries whose policies California officials reviewed, only Germany and Ireland still recommend isolation for five days, according to a presentation the California public health department gave health officials from other states in January. The Singapore ministry of health, in updated guidance late last year, said residents could “return to normal activities” once coronavirus symptoms resolve.\n\nEven before the Biden administration ended the public health emergency last May, much of the public had moved on from covid-19, with many people having long given up testing and masking, much less isolating when they come down with covid symptoms.\n\n“You see a lot of people with symptoms — you don’t know if they have covid or influenza or RSV — but in all three of those cases, they probably shouldn’t be at Target, coughing, and looking sick,” said Eli Perencevich, an internal medicine professor at the University of Iowa.",

  "text": "LAS VEGAS — The last time the Kansas City Chiefs lost a game, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid engaged in a physical confrontation more intense than the Super Bowl bump seen around the world. It wasn’t as shocking, however, because the 65-year-old coach was the aggressor. During a Christmas Day home game against the Las Vegas Raiders, the Chiefs were such a desperate sloppy mess on offense that Reid called a fake punt play that didn’t involve Kelce. It actually worked. Punter Tommy Townsend threw a pass to the sideline for the first down. But Kelce was frustrated. He slammed his helmet to the Arrowhead Stadium turf. A staffer picked it up and went to take it back to Kelce, but as he lifted it in the air to alert the superstar tight end, Reid swatted it from his hand like a skilled shot-blocker. Then the coach walked over to a helmetless Kelce, scolded the player and ended the conflict by thrusting his right shoulder into Kelce’s left side. Unlike Sunday night, Kelce was the one who lost balance. Reid stormed away, and Patrick Mahomes tapped Kelce on the stomach to settle him.\n\nThe Chiefs went on to lose for the fourth time in six games, their most prolonged slump during this era of trophy hoarding. And Kelce-Reid I was just the most heated skirmish of a tumultuous holiday in which Mahomes humiliated his offensive line during a screaming sideline fit. The next day, many wondered whether all the feuding confirmed that they were, finally, broken.\n\n“He caught me off balance,” Reid said, intimating that slow-motion replays of the incident made it look worse than it felt. “I wasn’t watching. He was really coming over [to tell me]: ‘Just put me in, I’ll score. I’ll score.’ So that’s really what it was. I love that. It’s not the first time. I appreciate him.”\n\nIn the aftermath of a 25-22 overtime triumph that made even neutral hearts pound, Kansas City couldn’t simply celebrate a dynasty-affirming victory over the San Francisco 49ers. The conversation couldn’t end with a contemplation of the greatness of Patrick Mahomes, whose unlimited talent gains substance and nuance each season. Praise of the Chiefs’ stellar defense and magnificent roster management had to wait. And Kelce’s romance with Taylor Swift, a relationship made in pop-culture heaven, now came with a sidebar.\n\nMeanwhile, in our sadistically divided nation, the rest of America handled it quite unwell. Everyone is looking for their own disgusted view of the country in everything, and our grandest annual sporting event provided the perfect grievance canvas. If Kelce were Black, would the thug accusations be louder? If he weren’t a coronavirus vaccine endorser, would the crowd that does its own research scrutinize him so heavily? Somehow, a football player’s rage became as much a politically divisive issue as a societal concern about anger management.\n\nKelce was the first to do wrong, and when you get caught raging at the Super Bowl, it becomes more than a fairly typical football argument. It’s important to have a deep conversation about tempers and inappropriate, cartoonish masculine behavior. But this incident is not the Swiss army knife to carve out any greater point.\n\nSome of the extreme indignation has been akin to the wrath Kelce displayed Sunday. However, Kelce stepped back, collected himself, played his best football in the second half and helped his team win a third championship in five seasons. And Reid saw the bigger picture. He’s a coach who looks beyond flaws and enjoys managing complicated relationships. He often gets the best out of his players by embracing them as individuals without barking for them to conform.\n\nTragedy has taught him to connect in this way. He’s a father who has experienced the heartbreak of addiction with two of his sons. His oldest, Garrett, died of an overdose 12 years ago. Another son, Britt, was sentenced to three years in prison in 2022 for driving while intoxicated and injuring a 5-year-old girl. Time and pain have transformed Reid into a man who coaches like a father who yearns to keep improving his leadership.\n\n“He’s one of the best leaders of men I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelce said. “And he’s helped me a lot with that, with channeling that emotion, with channeling that passion. I owe my entire career to that guy and being able to kind of control how emotional I get. I just love him.”\n\nReid and Kelce have been together since 2013, forming one of the strongest head coach-star player relationships in the NFL. In college at Cincinnati, Kelce failed a drug test for marijuana and served a suspension for the entire 2010 season. Reid, who epitomizes tough love, has been a key figure in his maturation into a transcendent player who, at 34, projects to have a successful life after football, even if his relationship with Swift doesn’t last.\n\n“I’m someone who did some things, who might have been considered a loose cannon early in my career,” Kelce told me four years ago, reflecting before his first Super Bowl. “This organization does an unbelievable job of helping guys find who they are as a professional and as people, and we learn how to conduct ourselves with that.”\n\nStill, he stumbles. Or, in this case, he made Reid stumble. In football, there’s often an overzealous need to promote a violent game’s virtue. Listen enough to the waxing about the teamwork, discipline and attention to detail that the sport demands and how it molds boys to men, and you start to forget it is also a vicious and debilitating game with a 100 percent injury rate.\n\nThey aren’t all madmen. But they play mad out of necessity. It’s inevitable that kind of fire will get uncontrollable on occasion. It happened Sunday, but it also happened six weeks before that. And in previous seasons, the wunderkind Mahomes has been caught screaming at Reid and barking almost nose to nose with Eric Bieniemy, his fiery former offensive coordinator.\n\nBut this is a dynasty that can absorb confrontation, that can rise above the ugly side of football. It says something about the character of the Chiefs that they can show their worst and still find a pathway back to being their best.\n\nThe cameras didn’t catch Kelce apologizing and embracing Reid shortly after the incident. But onstage for the Lombardi Trophy presentation, you could see the love that both men spoke about afterward. Kelce hugged Reid from behind. The coach didn’t stumble this time. He didn’t ram his shoulder into the tight end, either. He reached back and tapped him to show his appreciation.",

  "text": "But “The Daily Show,” which was never the same after he left, has been rudderless since Stewart’s successor, Trevor Noah, left in 2022. After a year of guest hosts auditioning with no end to the experiment in sight (despite all that new energy and fresh blood), it had started to feel like a dying franchise. The format, too, had come to seem a little vintage, given the speed at which users on social media platforms wittily process (and riff on) current events — frequently in the style Stewart pioneered. Bringing Stewart back for just one day a week (Mondays) would either revitalize “The Daily Show” or confirm it as the zombie some feared it had become.\n\nIt didn’t bode well for Stewart’s prospects that “The Problem with Jon Stewart” was canceled after just two seasons or that, ironically, Stewart’s new show sometimes felt a tad belated and derivative, as if it was borrowing from “Daily Show” alums such as John Oliver and Samantha Bee. There was, moreover, a sense that the man was very much a product of his time. The political climate has changed so quickly, and become so satire-proof, that not even Jon Stewart could be Jon Stewart anymore.\n\nPut differently, there was a concern that Stewart, who left at precisely the moment political discourse and social media went haywire, was — as a master satirist — ill-equipped to address the present in ways that parallel the comedian’s own assessment of the current information crisis: “The form of government we love so much is an analog — I don’t want to say dinosaur — but it is analog,” he told “The Daily Show: Ears Edition” podcast this week, explaining why he wanted to come back, “and the world now moves at an increasingly infinite digital pace. And reconciling those two things, I think, is the challenge of the moment for people.”\n\nBased on Monday’s performance, however, Stewart can still Stewart when the conditions are right. His return to that desk felt electric. Fans will find him, in broad strokes, anyway, strikingly unchanged. He remains extremely funny, energetic, precise and adept at inflecting a single bit with multiple meanings just by mugging at the camera. He looks good, despite several self-deprecating bits about how much he’s aged (which he deployed in the service of a larger argument about President Biden’s mental capacity, and whether discussing it was fair game). And while he can hit an easy setup out of the park, he’s still best in class at a sly mode of argumentation that catches the viewer unawares, from an angle they don’t quite expect. His insistence that Biden’s competence is fair game, for instance — which Stewart paraphrases as a failure to remember details while being deposed — set up a series of clips of various Trumps claiming, in depositions, that they just couldn’t remember.\n\nHe also remains committed to his signature “plague on both your houses” approach to political commentary — one that cemented his appeal as a fair-minded truth-teller in some quarters while also earning him eloquent (and persuasive) critiques. The sharpest of these was probably Steve Almond’s 2012 essay in “The Baffler” which, among other things, charged Stewart with championing a mealy-mouthed definition of civility that made “conversation” between opposing sides possible over heated but principled disagreements. Citing Stewart’s notorious, mega-viral exchange with the “Crossfire” co-hosts as the kind of exception that proved the rule — by demonstrating Stewart’s extraordinary gift for passionate confrontation and his deep reluctance to use it — Almond diagnosed “The Daily Show” host with an “aversion to conflict, to making any statement that might depart too dramatically from the cultural consensus and land him at the center of a controversy.”\n\nHe isn’t just warring with the media, or with the politicians he routinely skewered as a host, or with Trump, whose candidacy he delightedly mocked before decamping in 2015. He’s needling liberals for protecting Biden from scrutiny, leftists for insisting certain things are unsayable, and the electorate, generally, for caring too much about the 2024 election and too little about the everyday work of improving the country.\n\nIn general, though, he seems ready to advance a point of view (rather than settle for poking holes in those of others) and eager to stir the pot. That’s not exactly new: Stewart made waves when he appeared on his old friend Stephen Colbert’s show and endorsed the “lab leak” theory of the origins of covid-19 back in 2021. He maintained, in his monologue Monday night, that Biden deserved more scrutiny (rather than less) specifically because of the threat Trump posed, and that it was the job of the candidate (rather than the voters) to assuage concerns about competence. He took aim at his old network — specifically referencing China and artificial intelligence, the two subjects Apple reportedly objected to him covering. In his conversation with his first guest, Economist Editor in Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, he advanced the position that a global ideological realignment was underway along axes that had shifted from capitalism vs. communism to “woke and unwoke.”\n\nOpinions will vary on the accuracy of these assessments, but what’s clear is that in his first episode back at “The Daily Show,” Stewart is invested in mapping out his sense of the state of the discourse and his plans for his place within it. That includes the case against him, specifically, which was largely addressed through his special correspondents. Dulcé Sloan, in a bit where she insisted on standing outside the prototypical “American diner” many journalists reported from in 2016, refused to enter and ask voters what they think. “I know what they think. It’s what everybody thinks,” she said, which was that the public needs “more than just the same show with an older yet familiar face.” More pointed still was Jordan Klepper’s mock-hostile response to Stewart’s return, in which he accused him of brainwashing voters to accept the status quo by laughing at it when they could be out in the streets effecting change. Klepper derided his “’90s brand of snark and bothsiderism — George Bush is dumb! Al Gore is so boring! Wow. Searing, Jon.”\n\nJon Stewart didn’t just define political comedy for a generation. He made a particular orientation toward politics (and news) mainstream. In modeling a kind of cool and incisive, civil but skeptical outsiderhood that doesn’t work well with — or think much of — groups, Stewart fostered a community of cool kids who laughed along with him at the absurd political theater coming from those in power, but also — perhaps more damagingly — at any movement at all. (Most versions of civic engagement are, by dint of their cheesy slogans and sincerity, automatically and deeply uncool.) The biggest point the well-attended March to Restore Sanity made was how effectively Stewart had forged a community of skeptics who believed themselves above the humiliating homogeneity that membership in a political group (any political group) implies. Some group identities are acceptable. “Daily Show fans,” for instance, were cool. Democrats, in contrast, were not.\n\nStewart’s meatier response to his critics on this front was buried in the monologue — in an admonition that the oxygen and attention the election would inevitably consume should be tempered by sustained civic participation. Nov. 5 matters, Stewart told his viewers, but so does the day after. If the other guy wins, “the country is not over,” he said, and if he doesn’t, “the country is in no way safe.” What followed was an exhortation to eternal civic vigilance and tireless civic work. That doesn’t feel particularly coherent. It certainly wasn’t a repudiation of his contempt for cheerleading initiatives to get out the vote (for instance), which he mocked. But it does feel like a turn away from snark toward something that can brook the cheesy uncoolness that sometimes attends collective effort.",

  "text": "Jon Stewart returned to his old seat behind the desk of “The Daily Show” on Monday evening after a nearly nine-year hiatus, resuming his role as the late night show’s host just in time for the 2024 presidential election. Stewart did not spare President Biden or former president Donald Trump from pointed jokes — spotlighting how the front-runners in both parties are 81 and 77, respectively. And that 2024 is shaping up to look a lot like 2020.\n\n“We are not suggesting neither man is vibrant, productive or even capable. But they are both stretching the limits of being able to handle the toughest job in the world,” Stewart said. “It is not crazy to think that the oldest people in the history of the country to ever run for president might have some of these challenges.”\n\nWhile Biden and Trump would each be the oldest president by the end of their term if elected, previous elections also saw some older candidates, such as former New York mayor  Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who were both 78 while running in 2020.\n\n“The next nine months or so — and maybe more than that depending on the coup schedule — are gonna suck,” Stewart said, in a glib reference to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on the U. S. Capitol. “On the plus side, I’m told that at some point, the sun will run out of hydrogen,” Stewart said at one point.\n\nIn particular, the late night host zeroed in on a line in last week’s report by special counsel Robert K. Hur that described the president as “an elderly man with a poor memory,” mocking also the White House’s efforts to then reassure voters of Biden’s fitness for office.\n\n“My memory is fine,” Biden said Thursday, responding angrily to questioning of his mental fitness. “I’m the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States and finish the job I started,” he said. At the same news conference, Biden mistakenly referred to Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi as the president of Mexico during a discussion about facilitating aid into Gaza. “Geography buffs might have noticed that Gaza and Mexico do not share a border,” Stewart quipped.\n\nStewart defended his  swipes at Biden — which came thick and fast — as an exercise in his democratic duty. “The stakes of this election don’t make Donald Trump’s opponent less subject to scrutiny,” he said. “It actually makes him more subject to scrutiny.”\n\nStewart also criticized  Biden’s foreign policy, challenging the president on the language he used to characterize Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Last week, Biden said Israel’s military offensive was “over the top” — marking his sharpest rebuke of Israel yet.\n\n“I like how Biden describes Israel’s incessant bombing of civilians the same way my mother describes the Super Bowl halftime show: ‘It was a little much,’” Stewart said in response. Gaza’s Health Ministry reports that more than 28,000 people have been killed in the enclave. Israel launched the war after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack that killed around 1,200 people.\n\nAfter Biden’s campaign announced over the weekend that it was joining TikTok in an effort to appeal to younger voters, Stewart said the president’s first clip seemed to have the reverse effect.\n\nIn a series of quick-fire answers to questions about the Super Bowl, Biden declined to “choose” between footballer siblings Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce, who play for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs respectively. He said his favorite Kelce was “Momma Kelce” instead. “I understand she makes great chocolate chip cookies,” Biden said in the uploaded video.\n\nStewart will headline the show’s popular Monday night slot throughout the 2024 election cycle, with rotating hosts throughout the rest of the week. He previously hosted the show from 1999 to 2015. During that time, the show transformed the late night comedy landscape, won 24 Emmys and frequently went viral on social media. Last year, Comedy Central said that the show’s next permanent host will be announced in 2024, filling a seat left vacant by Trevor Noah since December 2022.\n\nStewart pointed out that it’s not just the presidential candidates who have aged. “Look at me,” he said. “Look what time hath wrought. Give the kids a treat of the lunar surface here,” he said beckoning the camera to zoom in on his face.",

  "text": "Abbas is backed by the West but is widely unpopular across the Palestinian territories, where people are seething at the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and a year of deadly raids across the West Bank. His autocratic government is viewed by many Palestinians as an extension of the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority’s “silence reflects a very clear weakness,” said Rula Shadeed, co-director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy. “And also that their hands are tied. The way that they have been handling the struggle for liberation has not been fruitful in any way.”\n\nAt 87 years old, Abbas is in the 18th year of a four-year term as head of the Palestinian Authority, established as an interim government by the 1993 Oslo accords. The agreements gave the authority partial sovereignty over parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which along with East Jerusalem were meant to be part of a future Palestinian state. Yet the Oslo maps no longer reflect the realities on the ground; the hope of a two-state solution has grown more remote with each passing year.\n\nIn 2007, following a disputed election in Gaza, Hamas violently ousted the Authority from the strip. Israel imposed a land and sea blockade on the tiny coastal enclave and fought four wars in Gaza in the intervening years. The fifth, which many fear will be the most deadly, was declared Sunday.\n\nThe fighting began Saturday when, under the cover of thousands of rockets fired from Gaza, hundreds of Hamas gunmen broke through Israel’s high-tech border wall and terrorized towns across the south. They killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 100 hostages back to the strip.\n\nIsrael has responded with an unrelenting campaign of airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 1,000 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Gazans on Saturday to “leave now,” but most have nowhere to go. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege” of the enclave, cutting off access to power and basic supplies.\n\nAt least 179 Palestinians have been killed across the territory since January, according to the United Nations, making 2023 the deadliest year for West Bank Palestinians in two decades. There has also been a surge in violent attacks by Israeli settlers, urged on by far-right members of Netanyahu’s government.\n\nIsraeli and Palestinian Authority security forces have struggled to contain the rise of new militant groups in Palestinian refugee camps. Some have ties to more established armed groups, including Hamas, but most are loosely organized. The majority of the fighters are young and poor. They are fed up with the occupation and disillusioned with their leaders in Ramallah.\n\nAbbas now finds himself caught in the middle, as he has been for much of his political career — criticized by Israel and the United States for not condemning militant violence, and by Palestinians for his close ties with Washington and the Authority’s security cooperation with Israel.\n\nEvents in Gaza are “increasing the political weight of Hamas and decreasing the political weight and influence of the PA,” said Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister of planning. “Because now is the time for fighting. And the popular parties are the parties involved in the fighting.”\n\nMkheimer Abusada, one of Gaza’s most respected political analysts, did not have politics on his mind when reached by phone from Gaza City. “Why are you asking about the PA?” he said. “Why aren’t you asking about setting up a humanitarian corridor? There are 2 million people who are trapped by Israel without a safe passage.”",

  "text": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.",

  "text": "In a possible nod in that direction, Hamas late Monday released two hostages, Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper, Israeli women in their 70s and 80s, to the Red Cross following mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt. The women crossed through Gaza’s Rafah border station into Egypt, were driven away from the border in ambulances and helicoptered to an Israeli hospital. Hamas said over the weekend that it sought to release the two for “crushing humanitarian reasons.” Both women’s husbands remain in captivity.\n\nHamas and Israel mark each day of war with new numbers measuring the accumulation of death and destruction. The Gaza Health Ministry said more than 5,000 Gaza residents have been killed so far, including 436 in the past 24 hours, primarily in the enclave’s south, where Israel has told more than 1 million Gazans to seek shelter from air raids in the north. The ministry’s figures, which could not be independently confirmed, are not broken down between civilians and militants.\n\nAs the conflict on the ground and in the air heated up, diplomatic and humanitarian initiatives also gained momentum. A third convoy of trucks carrying food, water and medicine entered Gaza through the border with Egypt on Monday. Israeli officials said they inspected the cargo to ensure that no fuel was delivered to Gaza, because they fear it would be used to power Hamas rockets.\n\nIn his session with Mitsotakis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the Greek leader for his country’s support and described the war as “civilization against barbarism. We’re on the side of civilization. We have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is ISIS,” he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nAt al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest, at least 150 people died or were dead on arrival between Sunday and Monday morning, according to a medical worker who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their safety. The hospital is treating more than 5,000 people, U. N. officials said, compared with its normal patient count of about 700.\n\nAt Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the chief of the neonatal unit, Hatem Edhair, said the facility will run out of fuel by Wednesday, leaving the eight babies in the intensive care unit and 10 in the neonatal ward at severe risk because half of them are on oxygen and CPAP (pressurized air) machines.\n\nThe war has already displaced more than 1 million people in Gaza, as residents flee air raids and heed Israeli warnings to evacuate, and hundreds of thousands in Israel, where the Hamas attack devastated towns across the south and where the military is working to evacuate northern communities that are vulnerable to Hezbollah assaults from Lebanon.",

  "text": "Wrapping up a trip to Israel on Wednesday, Biden told reporters that up to 20 trucks of aid from Egypt would be allowed into the enclave through the Rafah border crossing once potholes along the road and damage from Israeli airstrikes had been repaired. Humanitarian officials warned, however, that a host of issues must still be resolved before the trucks can start moving.\n\n“The diplomats are way behind in responding to an exploding emergency,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general for the Norwegian Refugee Council. “You now need a cease fire and you need massive access across several crossing points, even to be close to responding to the most acute needs as the entire population is now destitute.”\n\nThe Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas, has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years, leaving most of its 2.3 million residents dependent on aid even before the current conflict. Those deliveries stopped entirely when Israeli and Egyptian border crossings into Gaza were closed after Hamas militants killed at least 1,400 people in a surprise assault on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7.\n\nAn initial aid delivery will ease the crisis, experts said, but only fleetingly. “What is needed is consistent and unimpeded aid access into and within Gaza, not only for the entry of and safe passage of supplies but also for humanitarians to be able to undertake their work safely,” said Emma Beals, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute who researches the distribution of aid in conflict zones.\n\n“We need more than just a promise that aid is allowed to go in,” Martin Griffiths, the emergency relief coordinator who oversees humanitarian aid at the United Nations, told The Washington Post on Wednesday. “Aid must go in at scale and daily.” U. N. Secretary General António Guterres echoed that point upon arriving in Cairo early Thursday, telling reporters he is seeking agreement on “sustained” humanitarian relief.\n\nBut U. S. officials were quick to describe the first trucks as a test balloon, with no guarantee of future deliveries if Hamas will interfere. “If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people,” Biden said, speaking aboard Air Force One as he departed Israel. “As a practical matter it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.”\n\nHumanitarian officials emphasized the United Nations has established monitoring mechanisms in place for aid that crosses into Gaza. The European Union also has an assistance mission that operates at the Rafah border crossing in Egypt and could be called upon to inspect the trucks upon entry. It was unclear Thursday whether these agencies had been contacted about helping to monitor the aid route.\n\nDiscussions on inspections were still “ongoing,” U. S. and U.N. officials told The Post on Thursday. News reports in Arab media and elsewhere that a deal had been reached were “premature,” one official said. Another said the talks are “close, but not there yet.” Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.\n\n“It is outrageous to hold back emergency relief for children, women and families because they fear aid diversion. Most of the stuff that goes in, the fighting men are well stocked on, they do not need bottled water or baby powder,” Egeland said, adding that existing monitoring mechanisms can and should be implemented without delay.\n\nMore than 100 aid trucks were lined up Thursday in the Egyptian city of Arish, waiting for a greenlight to move to Rafah. On the other side of the border, Palestinians struggled to understand why the initial deliveries would be so small or how they would actually reach people in Gaza.\n\nMohamed Zanoon, an independent photographer who was working to document the aftermath of the Israeli air raids, said he was witnessing a “humanitarian catastrophe.” He has struggled to push from his mind the memories of children screaming beneath the rubble. “Twenty trucks is not enough,” he said by phone. “More than a million people need medical care in Gaza.”\n\nAmong the thorniest remaining questions is whether fuel will be allowed on the trucks. Without its regular deliveries, the last power plant in Gaza went dark last week, robbing the enclave of regular electricity. Hospitals have since struggled to keep the lights on with diesel generators. Doctors warn a total blackout would be a death sentence for patients on life support, in the operating theater and to newborns in incubators.\n\nAs news of the impending deal filtered through Gaza, residents described the aid effort as a drop in the ocean, and they fretted over whether they would receive anything all. “Okay, it is something,” said Yousef Hammash, a father of two from Gaza City. “At least we have it. Now we have to have a truce to distribute it. How are they going to do it under bombardment?”\n\nGriffiths, from the United Nations, said humanitarian officials have been engaged in “incredibly detailed negotiations” about what an aid program to southern Gaza would look like. He said relief workers need assurances that they will be able to deliver aid consistently and reach people where they are “in the places that they choose to be safe.”\n\nFor many Palestinians, nowhere in Gaza feels safe. The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Wednesday that Israeli warplanes bombed five bakeries in different locations, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds as they lined up to buy bread. Medics and aid workers have also been killed off duty, sometimes as they left work to check on their families.\n\n“The streets are not safe, and the entire population is in need,” Hammash said. “Every day we have to do our challenging mission of getting bread and water.” He moved his family from Gaza City to Khan Younis this week after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of over 1 million civilians in the northern part of the enclave. But the mass displacement has put such strain on resources in the south that Hammash said some people were now heading back home. “Either you get bombed in the north or you die from hunger here,” he said.",

Palestinians cite a series of letters in 1915 to 1916 between Mecca’s emir and the British high commissioner in Egypt, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, as outlining a promise of an independent Arab state.\n\nIn 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly negotiated between Britain and France planned to carve up the Middle East into spheres of influence, and determined that the land in question was to be internationalized.\n\nIn 1917, Britain’s foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, expressed his government’s support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” in a letter to Baron Walter Rothschild, the head of the British wing of the influential European Jewish banking family.\n\nTo Israelis, the missive marks a formal utterance of the Israeli state’s right to exist; to Palestinians, it was an early sign of their dispossession. The declaration also noted that it was “clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” nodding to the overwhelming majority Arab population in the region at the time. (About 90 percent of the population was Muslim in 1850, and about 80 percent in 1914.)\n\nLarge-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Both sides continued to assert their right to establish a state.",

  "text": "LONDON — Weighing yourself can be an uncomfortable experience for many people. Would you do it at the airport?Finland’s national airline carrier, Finnair, is asking its passengers to step on the scales along with their carry-on luggage to record their weights at the departure gate, as part of an effort to improve airplane balance calculations.\n\nThis program, it said in a statement, is “voluntary and anonymous” and an attempt to collect more accurate passenger data and prevent the aircraft from exceeding a “set maximum weight to ensure a safe take-off.”\n\nThis is part of a growing trend among airlines, which are deploying this strategy to ensure a plane’s total weight is accurate. While the weight of the aircraft, its fuel, cargo, water tanks and catering are known, airlines want to better pin down the variable weight of passengers and their carry-on bags on individual flights.\n\nBut Finnair’s program, which began this week at Helsinki Airport, is already polarizing people on social media. “I do not think that it is intrusive or unnecessary,” wrote one person online, calling the move “reasonable.” Others termed the move “fatphobic” and potentially “humiliating.”\n\nThe airline has said the data will remain anonymous. Business and leisure travelers on “selected European flights” and a number on long-haul flights will be offered the chance to participate.\n\n“The collected data is not linked in any way to the customer’s personal data,” Satu Munnukka, head of ground processes at Finnair, said in a statement. “We do not ask for the name or booking number.”\n\nThe total weight of the passenger and their carry-on baggage, their age, gender and travel class are recorded in a database, but “no information is collected that would allow participants to be identified,” Munnukka added. “Only the customer service agent working at the measuring point can see the total weight, so you can participate in the study with peace of mind.”\n\nIn 2013, Samoa Air became one of the first airline to weigh passengers and — controversially — charge a variable kilogram-per-mile rate based on whatever the scale had to say. Last year, Air New Zealand also carried out a weigh-in for its passengers for flight balance calculations.\n\nKorean Airlines faced some passenger backlash after undertaking a similar program last summer, with local media reporting that some travelers said they felt embarrassed to be weighed, while others argued that lighter passengers should be given larger baggage allowances.\n\nMost American carriers have ruled out such measures in recent years, while in the United Kingdom, an aviation start-up has been investigating more precise weight data methods at airports in a bid to save fuel costs and curb flight emissions.\n\nThe weight of customers and their carry-on baggage is generally calculated using average weights confirmed by the Civil Aviation Authority, Finnair said. The alternative option is for airlines to either use their own measurements or use standard weights defined by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.\n\nSince 2018, Finnair said it has used average weights based on its own measurements, but these estimates need to be updated every five years. “It’s now time to collect updated data,” spokeswoman Päivyt Tallqvist said in an email Friday.\n\nThe project began Monday, and “so far we have had some 800 volunteers participating in this — it is great to see that our customers are interested in volunteering in this data collection,” she added, underscoring that being weighed is not obligatory for anyone.\n\nThe survey will be rolled out again in the warmer months,  according to the airline, to take into account seasonal packing shifts in clothes.\n\nOnce complete, the information will be sent to the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency, Traficom, for validation before the airline can use the data for future aircraft balance and loading calculations between 2025 to 2030, Finnair said.",

  "text": "Given the increase in issues vexing travelers, it’s common to see frustrated fliers air their complaints on social media while tagging the offending airline in their posts. Maybe they’re miffed at a flight disruption or lost baggage. They’re likely hoping that a public shaming will spur the airline into fixing their problem. While airlines are active on social media and typically engage with aggrieved travelers in their direct messages, these types of posts are also prompting scam artists to swoop in and “help.”\n\nIn late January, after a second trip back from the runway to the gate to address a “paperwork” issue, I posted to X (formerly Twitter) about the flight delays. That generated the following reply from “Patrick, JetBlue Manager.”\n\n“We apologize for the situation and inconvenience caused. In order for us to be able to check about the situation, we kindly request that you please send us your reachable phone number so agent, JP Can assist.”\n\nShortly after Patrick’s reply came another notification that my previous post was liked and retweeted by an account bearing the name Thomas Clark JetBlue Supervisor. Thomas wrote: “Hi apologies for the inconvenience caused, kindly follow back and share a reachable number via DM for assistance please. Thank you.”\n\nIn addition to the odd social media interactions, there were reasons to be suspicious. Neither of the accounts had any kind of verification mark, and the account handle for “Patrick” had misspelled the word “manager” as “@PManeger1.” Additionally, “Patrick” seemed to be pretty new to the job, starting the account in January of 2024 and had since acquired zero followers.\n\nA cursory Google search revealed the offer of help was, indeed, too good to be true. The overhaul of X’s account verification system from legacy badges to a pay-for-play model has contributed to the problem.\n\n“Along with the rest of the industry, we have seen several fake social media accounts falsely representing themselves as JetBlue to deceive and defraud customers,” Derek Dombrowski, senior manager, corporate communications for JetBlue, wrote in an email to The Post.\n\nDombrowski said the airline works with a cyber fraud prevention business and its own legal counsel to combat the fraudulent posters. But with fraudulent social media accounts so easy to create, the removal process is akin to whack-a-mole. That means you better stay vigilant to avoid these predatory practices.\n\nAfter travelers vent their frustrations on social media, the scammer swoops in to offer assistance. That’s when they ask for personal information like a phone or WhatsApp number via direct message to continue the conversation and resolve the issue. That resolution often entails an offer to rebook your flight reservation and an ask for your credit card number.\n\nWhat can be particularly confusing is when scammers pop into an existing X exchange between the traveler and the legitimate account for an airline.\n\nSome fake accounts may have obvious cracks in their facade, such as misspellings in the account name or demonstrating odd conduct, like reposting your complaint. And any time someone asks for password or payment information over social media, your internal fraud alarm should go off.\n\nFor starters, steer clear and don’t respond to them. If you want to be proactive, you can file a report directly with the social media platform and/or with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You can also alert the airline so they can take action as well.\n\nDon’t tweet at an airline to solve your travel woes. (If you do go the social route, DM the airline instead.) The safest bet is to follow the advice posted by JetBlue (and echoed by other airlines) in its X bio. For any request that requires a response, such as assistance resolving a complaint or travel issue, use the airlines’ official webpage or app. It may not be as superficially satisfying as airing your grievance in the public square of social media, but at least you’ll be safe from potential predators.",

Kispert came off the bench to score 23 points. (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)An unusually populous pregame locker room was unusually quiet Wednesday night at Capital One Arena. Nearly every player on one side of the Washington Wizards’ dressing area was planted in his seat more than an hour before they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 114-106. Most nights before games, in the 30-minute period before tip-off in which reporters are permitted to be in the room, the players tend to be on the move, whether coming or going from the court to warm up, getting last-minute needs addressed with the medical staff or simply joking around with one another.The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news.After last year’s fireworks, what will this year’s NBA trade deadline bring?But Wednesday, the eve of the trade deadline, there was minimal action. Jordan Poole walked in and greeted everyone at one point, looking for something. Kyle Kuzma entered and crouched at his locker, getting his various compression garments in order. Anthony Gill chatted quietly with members of the PR staff.Otherwise, players slumped into their seats staring intensely, silently, at their phones.Call it pre-trade deadline jitters for a young roster that knows its front office is looking to make moves. The Wizards, at 9-41 and in the first year of a rebuild, are looking to acquire young talent and draft capital in exchange for impactful, experienced players such as Kuzma and Tyus Jones as Thursday’s 3 p.m. deadline looms.“It’s the most interesting time of the year for an NBA player, that’s for sure,” Corey Kispert said. “. . . It’s part of the life of playing in this league. It’s kind of one of the darker sides of it. . . . It’s definitely on all of our minds, but at the same time, we’re prepared for it.”Here’s another interpretation of the quiet: The Wizards are closing ranks. What else is a young player to do the day before some faces in that locker room might change?“We don’t focus on the outside noise,” interim coach Brian Keefe said Tuesday after practice. “We focus on these walls in here and the people who are in this building.”Joel Embiid will have knee surgery, dampening the 76ers’ playoff hopesThose blinders served the Wizards well against the Cavaliers (33-16), perhaps for more than one reason. Although Washington competed well despite the loss and despite 40 points by Donovan Mitchell, Poole endured loud, hearty boos from the crowd on three occasions in the fourth quarter — after an air ball, after a missed three-pointer in isolation and one final time when he fouled out with 18 seconds to play.The guard went scoreless, shot 0 for 5 from the field and had five assists.It was his first scoreless game since April 2021, when Poole was in his second season with the Golden State Warriors and playing, coincidentally, against the Wizards. Keefe explained his decision to sub Poole back in late in the fourth quarter when the game was still within reach — at least on the scoreboard, if not in terms of control or momentum.“Jordan’s one of our guys,” he said. “Jordan has made big shots for us, especially since I’ve taken over . . . so I want Jordan in those moments because he has no fear and he’s going to take the shot when it’s open. I’m always going to believe in him and go with him.”Aside from Poole’s performance, the Wizards showed legitimate improvement against a team that flattened them twice in early January. Their offense churned behind 28 points, four rebounds and two assists from Kuzma after the forward missed Sunday’s loss to Phoenix with left shoulder soreness. Kispert continued his season-long ascent with 23 points and seven rebounds off the bench.Individual defense on Mitchell was wanting — the Cavaliers’ centerpiece guard added eight rebounds and five assists in 38 minutes and torched the Wizards with 14-for-25 shooting.But there were positives in other areas that Kuzma attributed to the team’s new style of defense under Keefe. The Wizards outrebounded Cleveland 47-46 — the Cavaliers were without big man Tristan Thompson, who is serving a 25-game suspension for violating the league’s drug policy — after they were trounced on the boards in the teams’ first two meetings. Daniel Gafford won his matchup against Jarrett Allen more often than not and had 14 points and a team-high 13 rebounds.“Those two games at the top of the year in Cleveland, we were playing a different type of defensive scheme that really allowed [Allen] to cook,” Kuzma said. “So Gaff probably remembered that, played a lot more physical tonight and had a good showing.”A rare mid-quarter turnaround was another bright spot. Usually, Washington struggles to recover from a sluggish second-half start. On Wednesday, the Wizards bounced back after the visitors scored the first seven points of the second half and stayed competitive until the end.Arena spats escalate between Bowser and Leonsis, Youngkin and Va.

  "text": "Other people are going to grouse about the latest restaurant from the Alexandria-based Common Plate Hospitality group. This includes locals who dream of better nearby options for a meal out, people who don’t care to eat inside what looks like a piñata filled with flowers and a critic who can’t figure out how a chef with impressive credentials is behind some of the most unfortunate food he’s eaten in several seasons.\n\nJosé López-Picazo, the Madrid native in the Grove’s exhibition kitchen, has worked under some of the country’s best chefs: José Andrés and Fabio Trabocchi at Jaleo and Del Mar in Washington, respectively, and Julian Serrano at Picasso in the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. The starry résumé is one reason the managing partner of Common Plate recruited the chef. “He’s always been the man behind the man,” says Chad Sparrow, whose restaurants include Augie’s Mussel House, Mason Social and Urbano. The Grove, he says, puts López-Picazo front and center.\n\nOne of the eye-grabbers on the menu is black sausage from Spain, served as four tiny towers, each one of them balanced on tomato confit on a powdery crouton crowned with a sunny, dime-size quail egg. The appetizer is hard to eat in one bite (the eggs slipped off all four pieces) and not worth the trouble: The sausage was at once earthy and gummy. Crudo is as inescapable as AI. The “Latin fusion” at the Grove features the expected raw fish (halibut, in this case), but the leche de tigre — “tiger’s milk” or marinating liquid — is so thick and fruity it masks the fish, which swims to the table with a savory tuile that distinguishes many of the dishes here. López-Picazo makes the designs with a mold and flour and egg white, plus tints to make them black (squid ink), red (beets) or green (chlorophyll).\n\nSpain is where a lot of chefs from around the world go for inspiration, to taste the future. I count myself lucky to have sampled the novel ideas at trendsetters including Disfrutar in Barcelona. The Grove doesn’t charge the lofty prices of those master practitioners, but its output doesn’t taste close to them, either. My point is, artful and complicated approaches don’t need to get in the way of deliciousness.\n\nLook at the pork belly. You’d think 22 hours in a sous vide cooker would beat a block of meat into submission. But the chunk I got, propped up by a support of potatoes and cheese banded with bacon — the best part of the entree — was dense and tough in parts. I counted at least five sauces on the plate, which get lost in translation, plus what looked like a miniature Ferris wheel but was in reality another tuile. Stop this ride! I’m getting dizzy!\n\nThe more traditional Spanish plates are better bets. Seek out the delicate crystal bread with its light application of crushed tomatoes, or the riff on the Catalan classic of grilled or roasted vegetables, escalivada. López-Picazo layers slices of charcoal-kissed red peppers, eggplant and onion and stages them as a colorful bar with a hedge of microgreens and black dots of the aforementioned charred vegetables. Veal cheeks cooked to tenderness are splayed over finely chopped red cabbage that neatly straddles sweet and tang. This being the Grove, the main course gets some chorizo-colored “air” on top, foam that’s actually orange with carrot and ginger.\n\nHigh-end hybrid food tends to be complicated and labor-intensive. Like many chefs, López-Picazo has to compete in a market where experienced workers aren’t plentiful, and the suburbs are more of a challenge than the city. One of the reasons I returned to the Grove initially was because of a main course, whole dorade, that the top chef revealed from beneath a salt crust at the table. Some chefs use egg whites to make the salt seal; López-Picazo deploys lemongrass, ginger and lime zest, which infuse the fish, already meaty and rich, with spark and which treat recipients to enticing fragrance. Throw in some aioli and fingerling potatoes and I’m a happy camper — well, sans the undercooked carrots that come along for the ride.\n\nThat’s an issue at the Grove. Too many dishes have something that throws them off — rubbery calamari on a piece of halibut or chewy thin rings of brioche and guanciale (“false ravioli,” the chef calls them) around otherwise delicious bites of braised oxtail, their richness foiled by biting peppers, arranged on buttery mashed potatoes. Sometimes, the principal ingredient is to blame. Chunks of chorizo and racy minced peppers are the best part of a main course of chicken inspired by chilindrón, a hearty Spanish stew. The breast, fenced in with potatoes and cauliflower, is ordinary eating, despite the creamy teardrops of yellow cauliflower that finish it.\n\nThere’s nothing subtle about the restaurant, whose outside entrance crawls with faux green ivy and whose interior looks like the Cherry Blossom Festival no matter what time of year it is. The walls, ceiling and banquettes are an explosion of flowers — fake, painted or fabric — along with multiple neon accents. “Let it bloom,” reads a message on a wall. Sure, but no one seems to understand the power of moderation. Sparrow says he wanted something “bright and clean” to match the chef’s cooking. The Grove is definitely … bright.\n\nThe service is all over the map, too. My first visit, a fast-talking, no-nonsense server informed us “weopenedaboutamonthago” and asked “whatareyouthinkingforwater?” The second dinner showed off his opposite: a server seemingly fueled by a gallon of Red Bull and so enthusiastic, he made Taylor Swift watching her beau play ball inert by comparison. Did I mention the sommelier disputed a bottle of corked wine without first tasting it herself? She later agreed it was bad, but the exchange made for an uncomfortable introduction. On the other hand, this messy eater appreciated servers who swooped in and erased the Jackson Pollock I created on the table, and how kind of the restaurant to lower the volume on the music when a friend asked. (Not every place does that.)\n\nSparrow says locals are direct with their feedback. To the Grove’s credit, some prices were slashed when customers complained. “This isn’t downtown D. C.,” he says they let him know. (The scallops are now $10 cheaper than after the restaurant sprouted in November.)\n\nThere are moments, fleeting ones, where I could see myself coming back: for those veal cheeks, that whole fish, the desserts. Go for the slender, sugar-sprinkled churros served with intense warm chocolate sauce and the fluffy, not-too-sweet cheesecake with a dimple of apricot jam. Both desserts are straightforward and satisfying.\n\nOn my last visit, I watched a server present a smoke-filled, globe-size cloche containing lamb shank to a woman I guessed might be dining with her husband. For about the time it takes for me to type this vignette, her head was invisible in the oak-heavy fog. Her husband couldn’t stop laughing. When the smoke finally disappeared, she seemed less than amused.",

  "text": "MANILA — At least 55 people died and 32 were injured in one of the southern Philippines’ deadliest landslides in recent years, the government of Davao de Oro province said Monday. Search and retrieval operations are still underway for dozens more missing after the landslide that took place  Tuesday night on the southern island of Mindanao in the mining town of Maco, some 600 miles south of the capital, Manila. The death toll is expected to rise as the government verifies more dead and missing. A local official said during a live-streamed news conference late Monday afternoon that of the bodies that have been recovered, five  remain unidentified and that 51 people are still unaccounted for.\n\nThe landslide swept away three buses and a jeepney carrying miners and buried a village, according to authorities. The region was inundated by floods in the past week, hampering rescue operations. One of the survivors identified in recent days is a 3-year-old girl.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the U. S. Agency for International Development said it is providing about $1.25 million in humanitarian aid for communities hit by flooding and landslides in Davao de Oro and surrounding provinces on Mindanao.\n\nThe miners in the buses and jeepney, an elongated jeep-like vehicle widely used for public transportation, worked for the Philippine company Apex Mining, which operates a gold mine in Maco. The company said in a statement Saturday that it was assisting the government with relief and rescue operations.\n\n“The company is deeply saddened by this tragedy, and we can only imagine the pain that the families of the missing and the dead are going through,” said Luis Sarmiento, president and CEO of Apex Mining.\n\nEnvironmental groups have called for an independent investigation into the mining company. However, as of Saturday, government officials attributed the landslide primarily to heavy rainfall. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau said the affected area is outside the mining site, although the company’s transport vehicles were “temporarily stationed” there.\n\nLandslides occurred there in 2007 and 2008, according to local officials, but residents eventually moved back to be closer to their work, believing it was safe. Around 21 died in the last landslide, Edward Macapili, executive assistant for communications for Davao de Oro, told The Washington Post.\n\n“There is a policy that this is a no-build zone,” Macapili told radio station Teleradyo Serbisyo on Saturday. “After 2008, people went back, and it was tolerated by the previous administration of the provincial government of Davao de Oro and Apex Mining itself.”\n\nThe vulnerability of communities in hazard-prone areas is a common issue in the Philippines, an archipelago that is racked by such various disasters as earthquakes and typhoons.\n\n“People should not have been allowed to settle in that place, and there is no excuse for all who are responsible for allowing it,” said Mahar Lagmay, executive director of the Resilience Institute at the University of the Philippines. Lagmay urged the government to follow international guidelines on risk assessment and hazard mapping, not just for identifying danger zones but for spotting livable areas, too.\n\nExtensive rainfall in the southern Philippines has impacted more than a million people in the past week, leaving hundreds of thousands displaced, the U. S. Embassy in Manila said.",

  "text": "Israel’s military said Marman and Har were both in “good medical condition.” They were transported via military helicopters to Sheba Tel Hashomer Medical Center in Israel, where the medical staff said their condition was “stable” and where they were reunited with their families.\n\n“I salute our brave warriors for the bold action that led to their liberation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. “Only the continuation of military pressure until complete victory will result in the release of all our abductees. We will not miss any opportunity to bring them home.”\n\nArmed Hamas militants were guarding the men and were also spread throughout the building, he said. A minute later, he said, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes; Israeli soldiers shielded the hostages with their bodies as other troops exchanged heavy fire with Hamas fighters.\n\nNetanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were with Israel’s military chief as the raid unfolded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting, the military said. In a visit Monday with the unit that carried out the operation, Netanyahu called it “one of the most successful rescue raids in the history of Israel. … A perfect operation that was perfectly executed.”\n\nIt was only the second successful rescue mission since the start of the ground incursion into Gaza in late October — on Oct. 30, the IDF rescued a female hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, in addition to 29 others who are believed to be dead, most of them killed during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMany of the families of the hostages and the thousands of Israelis who have joined them in street protests have called on the government to agree to a deal with Hamas to exchange hostages for prisoners, believing it is the only way to guarantee the safety of their loved ones and questioning whether military operations are a realistic strategy on a larger scale.\n\n“We commend the IDF soldiers who demonstrated strength and bravery to secure the release of the two hostages, and wish them all to return home safely and speedily,” said a statement Monday by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing most of the families.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei lauded the rescue operation Monday morning and said in a social media post that in a meeting with Netanyahu last week in Jerusalem, he requested “the release of every one of the Argentine hostages” and continued to “maintain his condemnation of Hamas terrorism.”\n\nThe operation came hours after Netanyahu spoke on the phone with President Biden, who warned that an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah without appropriate accommodations for the civilian population would be seen as unacceptable to the United States, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nOn Monday, it remained unclear how the rescue — lasting about an hour and limited in its scope — would affect Israel’s broader plans for a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, where it says Hamas’s top leaders are hiding, using the remaining hostages as shields.\n\nEgypt has reinforced its border, signaling that it would not accept an exodus of refugees fleeing the fighting. It has warned that an Israeli invasion of the area along its border could endanger the countries’ 1979 peace treaty that has for decades stabilized the region.\n\nThe rescue operation was carried out amid negotiations to return the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as a halt in the fighting. Senior American, Egyptian and Qatari officials are expected to convene in Cairo on Tuesday; it is still unclear if Israel will send a delegation.\n\nDavid Tsur, former head of Yamam, the special counterterrorism unit that was among the agencies involved in the overnight mission, said that because the talks have been so far unsuccessful, the Israeli army took advantage of the “very short window of opportunity” to free the hostages. But he said it will have consequences for future operations.",

The Capitals' inability to stay out of the penalty box proved costly later in a 4-2 loss. (Jim Rassol/AP)SUNRISE, Fla. — Compared with their recent performances, the Washington Capitals played a better game Thursday at Amerant Bank Arena. Winless in five straight games entering the matchup against the Florida Panthers, the Capitals took a borderline step forward against one of the top teams in the NHL. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news.It was far from enough, however, to halt their skid. The Capitals failed to hold a pair of leads and fell to the Panthers, 4-2, extending their winless streak to six games. The Capitals have been outscored 28-13 during the drought.Goaltender Darcy Kuemper made 37 saves on 40 shots for Washington. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 21 of 23 for Florida.The Capitals took a first-period lead — just the second time during this skid they led — when Alex Ovechkin scored his trademark goal, a one-timer from the left faceoff circle on the power play. In the Capitals’ previous five games, they held a lead for just 64 seconds; the 3:22 from Ovechkin’s goal to the end of the first period more than tripled that.Svrluga: The Capitals quandary is balancing Ovechkin's chase with roster realities“First period, loved from a competitiveness standpoint, from our work ethic, from our battle level, puck decisions. Each play, each time we got the puck, it was in the spot that it needed to be,” Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery said. “You’re playing in a tight game against a good team, and now the problem is you have to be able to sustain that. The level of pace of games and playing against these teams, it’s difficult for us to maintain that pace and be able to play at that level and that speed for 60 minutes. It catches up with us at certain points.”The Panthers evened the score just 4:29 into the second period on a goal from Matthew Tkachuk in what may well be his office: the front of the net. The hosts looked to have pulled ahead a few minutes later when Evan Rodrigues beat Kuemper with a slick wrist shot that he tucked under the crossbar, but the Capitals challenged the play for offside, and the goal was called back.Instead of his team trailing 2-1, winger Anthony Mantha put Washington up by that same margin with a well-worked rush goal from linemates Aliaksei Protas and Mike Sgarbossa at the 14:03 mark of the second. Protas did most of the heavy lifting, winning a puck in the neutral zone and bringing it across the blue line before slipping it to Sgarbossa in the slot. Sgarbossa spotted Mantha crashing toward the back post, with no defender within reach, and slid Mantha a pass that he just had to tap once to elevate over Bobrovsky.The Panthers entered Thursday’s game with the 10th-ranked power play in the NHL, converting at 24.1 percent. Winger Sam Reinhart alone had 20 of their 40 goals on the man advantage; both the Capitals and the San Jose Sharks had 19 power-play goals on the season heading into the matchup.“Reinhart’s having an out of this world year on the man advantage,” Carbery said before the game. “ … They pose some issues, so discipline will be important. We want to keep them off the power play as much as we can. If we can play this game five-on-five, that’s our advantage.”Washington took four penalties in the first period and gave Florida three power plays; one penalty was a coincidental minor on defenseman Martin Fehervary after he got into a slashing battle with Tkachuk. The Capitals managed to kill all three power plays and a fourth when center Nic Dowd went off for his second penalty of the game at 8:28 of the second period. But the parade to the penalty box without allowing a goal proved to be unsustainable.Winger Tom Wilson was sent off for elbowing at 17:20 of the second, and Reinhart needed just 12 seconds to score his league-leading 21st power-play goal.Despite producing just four shots on goal in the second period, the Capitals headed into the final 20 minutes — as coaches often say — just one shot away from taking the lead. That also meant the Panthers were one shot away, and they peppered Kuemper throughout the frame as Washington struggled to clear its defensive zone and string together offensive sequences.“We’ve got to make better plays to get the puck out of the zone,” defenseman John Carlson said. “That was difference. We could do stuff when we did get into the [offensive] zone better, but if the puck’s on our stick, we’ve got to make better plays.”Kuemper made save after save until, finally, on Florida’s 14th shot of the period, it was one too many. Ryan Lomberg had time and space from close range in the slot with 5:32 left to play, and he lifted his shot over Kuemper’s glove and under the bar to give the Panthers their first lead of the game — and the only lead they needed.“You could say that maybe that’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back there on the last one,” Carbery said.The Capitals went on the power play late in the third period, giving them one last chance to draw even, but they were unable to get their structure fully set up and didn’t generate any threatening scoring chances. Eetu Luostarinen hit the empty net with 53 seconds left to seal it.Though shots on goal were even at 13 through the first period, by the time the final horn sounded, Florida had recorded 41 to Washington’s 23.“That’s a good question,” Mantha said when asked about the lack of offensive generation. “If you do have the answer, we’ve been looking for it for a while now. I don’t know. It feels like we’re one and done. We’re trying something on the entry and it doesn’t work, and now we’re playing 40 seconds in our zone.”Note: Defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk missed Thursday’s game with an illness. Ethan Bear drew into the lineup in his place. Matthew Phillips skated on the right wing of the fourth line in place of Nicolas Aube-Kubel, who was a healthy scratch.Capitals get a pair of leads, blow a pair of leads as skid reaches sixCapitals get a pair of leads, blow a pair of leads as skid reaches sixCapitals’ skid reaches five in troublesome return from all-star breakCapitals’ skid reaches five in troublesome return from all-star breakAn eerie calm looms over Wizards on the eve of the NBA trade deadline What $85 will get you at 5 flower shops in the D.C. areaSingle on Valentine’s Day?

  "text": "Ben Thorne, senior intelligence manager at risk management firm Crisis24, said travelers should use those advisories as a jumping-off point to ask more questions: Are only pockets of a country or city considered off-limits? What are the specific concerns? Guidance that other countries provide for their citizens could also be good resource.\n\nDave Komendat, senior security adviser for International SOS, a travel security firm, said potential visitors should also pay attention to the overall stability and security environment of a destination and whether it has a history of unrest. The State Department or the World Factbook from the CIA are good resources, he said.\n\nVisitors should also check on safety features at their accommodations, whether they are staying at an Airbnb or hotel or resort, Thorne said. Are there fire alarms, carbon monoxide detectors and fire suppression systems? Is there security at the front desk or cameras?\n\nThe State Department said vacationers should make sure to read the information page for the country they’re visiting to be clear on local laws and what might get them arrested; examples the department provided include having a stray bullet in luggage and traveling with products that contain THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana.\n\nKomendat said travelers should familiarize themselves with the process of going through customs, picking up baggage and especially arranging transportation from the airport in their destination. In his own travel to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, he said, he walks through a pavilion where tour operators and transportation services make pitches to the new arrivals.\n\n“If you didn’t know better, you would stop in that pavilion and someone would tell you they’re here to get you to your hotel when actually they’re not,” he said. “Most hotels will provide specific pickup and drop-off info.”\n\nThorne said depending on where you are, sometimes taxis can be better than a ride-hailing service like Uber or Lyft — or they might carry a higher risk. Ride hailing could be a good option in some places, or not-so-good in others. Ask hotels for advice on what to take, he said; hotel-provided transportation is ideal.\n\n“What this really is is not being fearful or skeptical but alert and attentive to your surroundings,” he said. That means not being buried in a phone or tuned out listening to music or a podcast at all times. “It will help you have a little more attention to changes in what’s around you.”\n\nWhen drinking alcohol on vacation, Thorne said travelers should always keep a close eye on their beverage and never accept free drinks from strangers. A good approach is only drinking out of bottles or cans that are sealed — and you’re the one breaking the seal. Earlier this month, two women from Kentucky alleged they were drugged and raped by staff members at a resort in Grand Bahama, where they stopped during their cruise. They claimed their drinks were spiked, according to multiple outlets. The Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a news release it made two arrests for sexual assault.\n\nWhen visiting another country, especially one where English isn’t the primary language, Komendat said people should make sure they have a language translation app and know how to use it. They should also put an exchange rate calculator on their phone, spend the money to be able to use a cellphone in foreign destinations and learn the system to call for help in an emergency. The State Department said a U. S. citizen who needs emergency help should also get in touch with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.",

  "text": "Over the intervening four decades or so, Trump’s rhetoric hasn’t really changed much. What have changed are the geopolitical realities and Trump’s own ambitions. Now, as he did over the weekend, Trump uses the idea of NATO allies “owing” money to the organization — which none do — as cover for his obvious empathy toward Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\n\n“One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, ‘Well, sir, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?’ ” he claimed during a rally in South Carolina. “I said, ‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’ He said, ‘Yes, let’s say that happened.’ No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.”\n\nIt’s important to point out that this framing is false. It has long been the case that the United States contributes a large chunk of NATO’s resources in money, personnel and equipment. Back in 1987, when Trump was talking to CNN at the tail end of the Cold War, the Congressional Budget Office released a report documenting the difference between the United States and other NATO members. At the time, NATO members were called to spend at least 3 percent of their annual gross domestic product on defense but, the CBO report noted, only the United States had consistently hit that mark.\n\nIn 2006, 15 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the NATO allies set a new target of 2 percent. Five years later, only three countries were hitting the target: the United States, Greece and Britain. By the time Trump had become the Republican Party nominee for the 2016 presidential election — running, in part, on the argument that the United States was getting a raw deal from the alliance — five countries were over the 2 percent mark. In 2022, seven were.\n\nNote that this is not a bill paid by member countries to the alliance. It is, instead, an effort to establish preparedness, to have enough resources that NATO is able to fulfill its mission. To oversimplify, you might think of it like trying to set aside 5 percent of your income to buy Christmas presents. If you fall short, it’s not that you owe yourself money; it’s that you have less than you had hoped.\n\nDefense spending relative to GDP is one of two targets that NATO sets for member nations. The other is that members spend a fifth of their defense budgets on equipment, as opposed to personnel or other line items. On that metric, most members are in compliance. In 2014, only seven member nations were at or over 20 percent; in 2022, nearly all were, thanks to a surge in 2021 and 2022.\n\nSince 2014, NATO members have on average both increased their relative spending on defense and the percentage of that spending that’s on equipment. In 2014, NATO members spent 1.4 percent of their national GDPs on defense; by 2022, the average was 1.7 percent. In 2014, an average of 12.9 percent of defense spending was on equipment, rising to 27.3 percent in 2022.\n\nYou can see the trend below, with averages indicated for every two years and the change from 2014 to 2018 to 2022 indicated for each of the member countries.\n\nThe country that spends the lowest percentage of its GDP on defense is Luxembourg, which in 2022 spent an estimated 0.6 percent of GDP. But Luxembourg — population about 640,000 — spent the most on defense relative to population. Norway was in second and the United States in third.\n\nNotice that Trump’s rhetoric against the United States’ NATO allies has gotten more aggressive despite a broad improvement in the thing that he supposedly finds so offensive about their participation. He says the same thing about NATO he said in 1987, despite changes in membership and changes in how those members participate in the alliance.\n\nSince then, though, Trump’s warmth toward autocrats and Putin in particular has become only more pronounced. When Russia prepared to launch its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump’s immediate response was to praise Putin’s “genius.” After the invasion began, he called the move “smart.” Over the past two years, Trump’s seen much of his party reorient its foreign policy around his worldview: that American support for Ukraine is excessive — or even that the United States shouldn’t side against Russia at all.\n\nWhat Trump says at his campaign rallies are things that he believes his base will enjoy. The line about how NATO doesn’t pay its bills — a negative, dishonest framing — has been used for years as a way to shrug at the United States’ commitment to the alliance. But now, even as members have improved relative to both metrics NATO establishes and even as Russia’s hostile ambitions are much more immediately obvious, Trump takes the rhetoric further. “Let them do whatever they want.”",

It must do the work we expect from the national Party and do it flawlessly,” Trump said in the statement. “That means helping to ensure fair and transparent elections across the country, getting out the vote everywhere — even in parts of the country where it won’t be easy — and working with my campaign, as the Republican presumptive nominee for President, to win this election and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe moves come amid Trump’s growing criticism of current RNC chair McDaniel, who is expected to leave her job after the Feb. 24 South Carolina primary amid Trump’s unhappiness over lagging fundraising and other problems. LaCivita has told others he wants to make widespread changes at the organization.\n\nThe 168 members of the Republican Party will have to vote on Whatley and Lara Trump, and LaCivita would have to be hired by the party’s leadership. But Trump’s endorsement makes the appointments likely to happen, longtime party observers say.\n\nThe plan for a Monday statement surprised some of the party’s officials, who have been negotiating a transition with Trump for weeks after he began telling others he wanted to push McDaniel out.\n\nTrump decided to move up his announcement, planned for after the South Carolina primary, “because it had all sort of leaked out,” an adviser said. “It was just to rip the Band-Aid off and get it all over with.”\n\nMcDaniel has not officially said she was resigning. A meeting of the party to pick new leadership is expected to happen in March.\n\nInstalling a family member and a top aide would probably give Trump far more operational control over the RNC and how it spends large sums of money in the election. The party has paid millions of dollars of Trump’s legal bills before he became an official 2024 presidential candidate and could do so again.\n\nLara Trump — who is married to the former president’s son, Eric Trump — weighed a Senate run and has been heavily involved in the former president’s political efforts in recent years. The co-chair salary is set by the RNC’s budget committee but is usually around $250,000, a party official said.\n\nMcDaniel, who is in her fourth term as chair of the RNC, was expected to serve until 2025 but has considered leaving for months. Her relationship with Trump soured over the Republican primary debates featuring his challengers this past fall, according to the people familiar with the discussions. Trump wanted her to cancel them and she declined.\n\nTrump and his allies were also unhappy with the lackluster fundraising record of the RNC, which had about half as much money as the Democratic National Committee at the end of December.\n\nBetsy Ankeny, the campaign manager for Trump primary challenger Nikki Haley, said in a statement Monday night that “Trump just announced he is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.”\n\n“Under Donald Trump and current RNC leadership, Republicans lost elections in 2018, 2020 and 2022, and now the RNC is effectively bankrupt,” Ankeny said. “Nikki Haley’s plan for the RNC? Blow it all up.”",

  "text": "All were also overlooked for the team’s December camp, the first since Emma Hayes was tabbed to run the program when her tenure with English club Chelsea ends in May. Those roster decisions — a collaboration between Hayes and interim coach Twila Kilgore — did not set off alarms because some regulars required rest and prospects needed opportunity.\n\nThe latest selections, however, are a clear sign that career tenure and automatic assignments under previous coach Vlatko Andonovski will not guarantee an invitation.\n\n“Nobody is out of the mix,” Kilgore said. “That goes for some of our bigger names; that goes for lesser names that we’ve been tracking. We want to get it right, and everybody’s still involved. … This is the group we feel is the right group for right now.”\n\nMorgan, a 34-year-old striker who has played in four World Cups and was a co-captain in Australia and New Zealand last summer, is the program’s active scoring leader by a wide margin and sits fifth on the all-time list with 121 in 215 appearances. But she has gone 11 games without a goal and posted two in 18 international matches.\n\nSauerbrunn, 38, captained the squad before suffering a foot injury that forced her to miss the World Cup last year. She has been poised to cap her stellar career at the Summer Games in Paris. Sullivan, 28, was the team’s primary defensive midfielder the past two years.\n\nFinal decisions about the Olympic squad are months away and performances in the NWSL or leagues abroad this spring could sway the coaching staff. “We will be watching,” Kilgore said.\n\nBut with few U. S. camps remaining and the Olympic roster limited to 18 players, the outlook for many seems to have grown faint.\n\nAlso left out was midfielder Savannah DeMelo, 25, who started two World Cup matches. She was invited to this camp for pretournament training purposes only. Mallory Swanson, a 25-year-old star forward sidelined since last spring with a major knee injury, was also invited to work out as she prepares to return to the NWSL.\n\n“We believe she’s absolutely ready for this step,” Kilgore said. “She has stayed connected and involved in different ways while going through her recovery, and this is just the next natural progression.”\n\nThe other nonroster invitee is Gisele Thompson, an 18-year-old defender preparing for her NWSL rookie season with Angel City. Her sister, World Cup forward Alyssa Thompson, 19, wasn’t selected to the Gold Cup roster because a back ailment has limited her winter training.\n\nThe W Gold Cup involves eight teams from the Concacaf region (North and Central America and the Caribbean) and four guests from South America: Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Paraguay.\n\nThe United States will play all of its group matches in Carson, Calif.: Guyana or Dominican Republic on Feb. 20, Argentina on Feb. 23 and Mexico on Feb. 26.",

It expressed “deep concern” while condemning attacks on civilians “wherever they may be.” But one of Morocco’s largest parties in Parliament called Hamas’s actions “heroic” and a “legitimate reaction to daily violations.”\n\nSudan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement published by the official Sudan News Agency that the violence stemmed from a decline in international interest in the Palestinian issue. Sudan signed the Abraham Accords in 2021.\n\n“Sudan renews its support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to have their independent state,” the statement read.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has been in talks for months with Israel about a potential normalization agreement but is not part of the Abraham Accords, called for an immediate end to the violence. It did not explicitly denounce Hamas.\n\n“The Kingdom recalls its repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities,” the statement read.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nLionel Messi infuriates Hong Kong fans by sitting out match with injuryHong Kong soccer fans booed and called for refunds after Lionel Messi stayed on the Inter Miami bench for the entire match on Feb. 4. (Video: Reuters)Lionel Messi and David Beckham heard boos and chants of “Refund!” from fans in Hong Kong, where government officials asked for an explanation for why the soccer star, who plays for Beckham’s Inter Miami, did not play Sunday in a friendly. Messi remained on the bench with a hamstring injury as shouts of “We want Messi!” and boos intensified from the crowd of nearly 40,000 in the second half of Inter’s 4-1 victory over a local League XI team. As Beckham attempted to thank fans for their “incredible support” after the final whistle, he was drowned out by jeers.Officials had hoped that the match would help enhance Hong Kong’s image as an attraction for international events amid a slow economic recovery, and Kevin Yeung, the city’s secretary for culture, sports and tourism, said government officials were told repeatedly that Messi would play. He was, officials added, contracted to play at least 45 minutes. The 36-year-old star, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in 2022, has been dealing with the hamstring injury but started all three of his team’s preseason games before coming on in the 83rd minute Thursday in a 6-0 loss to Al Nassr in Riyadh.Lionel Messi and his teammate Luis Suarez were on the bench for Inter Miami's 4-1 win against a Hong Kong League XI, prompting boos and chants of ‘refund’ from angry and disappointed fans https://t.co/mkqQvOY2Rc pic.twitter.com/omMIUGFGiB— Reuters (@Reuters) February 5, 2024\n\nMessi wasn’t the only star to miss the exhibition. Luis Suárez, the Uruguay striker who joined Inter in December, missed the match with a knee injury. Manager Gerardo Martino apologized to fans, saying the decision was “made with our medical staff. If there was a way they could have played even a little while we would have done it, but there was too much risk involved.”Yeung said officials learned Messi’s injury would keep him from playing with 10 minutes left in the match. “We immediately requested them to explore other remedies, such as Messi appearing on the field to interact with his fans and receiving the trophy,” Yeung said at a news conference Monday. “Unfortunately, as you all see, this did not work out.”Exhibition organizers had been awarded $2 million in funding by a government advisory committee, and tickets, which cost up to $624, were eagerly snapped up when they went on sale in December. The government said Sunday night that it might reduce funds allocated for the event.“The organizer [Tatler Asia] owes all football fans an explanation,” the government’s major sports events committee said in a statement, adding that it would “take follow-up actions with the organizer according to the terms and conditions, which includes reducing the amount of funding as a result of Messi not playing the match.”Yeung said no money has been paid yet. “One of the key terms of our funding agreement with Tatler Asia was for Messi to participate in the match for at least 45 minutes, subject to fitness and safety considerations,” he said.Tatler Asia said Sunday night that he had no advance warning that Messi or Suárez would be unavailable and expressed its “extreme disappointment.”Inter Miami’s Asian tour ends Wednesday with a friendly against Vissel Kobe in Japan.Lionel Messi infuriates Hong Kong fans by sitting out match with injuryLionel Messi infuriates Hong Kong fans by sitting out match with injuryMatti Peltola is ready for a D.C. adventure with UnitedMatti Peltola is ready for a D.C. adventure with UnitedFor the Commanders, all that matters is getting it right at quarterbackBack in D.C., Bradley Beal shows plenty of love on his way to 43 points Sign in or create a free account to save your preferences",

  "text": "The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re’im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.\n\nAt least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.\n\nThe attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. “The event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,” ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.\n\nThe festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.\n\nBen Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. “I took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,” she said. “The people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.”\n\nThey drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.\n\nOn Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.\n\nArgamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. “If she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn’t have gone, but we knew nothing,” Marciano said. “She wasn’t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, ‘Go; you’re young.’ I regret that.”\n\nIn the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, “Allahu akbar!” A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair.",

  "text": "The U. S. men’s national soccer team will play Colombia in a Copa América tuneup June 8 at FedEx Field in Landover, people familiar with the matter said.The U.S. Soccer Federation declined to comment Friday but scheduled a news conference in Maryland on Tuesday to make a “major announcement.” Among those slated to attend are U.S. Coach Gregg Berhalter and officials from the Washington Commanders, who own the stadium.\n\nThe match will fall 15 days before the Americans open group play in the famed South American tournament, set to take place in the United States for the second time in eight years.\n\nThe USSF has been working on two heavyweight friendlies during the three-week training camp, which will open June 3. Brazil is reportedly the other opponent, June 12 at a venue to be determined.\n\nThe USSF had initially targeted Uruguay and Brazil as opponents but pivoted when the United States and Uruguay were drawn into the same Copa América group.\n\nTop U. S. players, such as Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, are scheduled to report to camp following the end of their European league seasons in May.\n\nThe United States and Colombia have met 21 times, with the Colombians boasting a seven-game unbeaten streak. The most recent game was in January 2023, a 0-0 draw in Carson, Calif.\n\nThe most famous clash came at the 1994 World Cup, a 2-1 U. S. upset at the Rose Bowl. Since then, the Americans have a 1-7-4 record against Colombia.\n\nThe U. S. men have not played at FedEx Field since a 2012 friendly against Brazil that drew more than 67,000. Their most recent match in the D.C. area was October 2019 against Cuba in the Concacaf Nations League at Audi Field.\n\nFedEx Field — which has a seating capacity 3½ times larger than Audi Field’s — has hosted many soccer games over 25 years, including two Premier League preseason friendlies last summer: Chelsea vs. Fulham and Aston Villa vs. Brentford.\n\nFeaturing several global powers, Copa América promises the stiffest test for the U. S. squad before the 2026 World Cup is held in the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nSix teams from Concacaf, which encompasses North and Central America and the Caribbean, will join all 10 nations that compete in Conmebol, the South American confederation, in Copa América’s 48th edition since 1916.\n\nBerhalter’s team should get through the group stage as a top-two finisher — the opponents are Bolivia on June 23 in Arlington, Tex., Panama on June 27 in Atlanta and Uruguay on July 1 in Kansas City, Mo. — and would probably face Brazil or Colombia in the quarterfinals.\n\nDetermined to rebound from a 2022 World Cup absence, Colombia is carrying a 19-game unbeaten streak into next month’s friendlies against Spain and Romania. In South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, the Colombians are 3-0-3 and in third place in a 10-nation scramble for six automatic berths.",

  "text": "On Tuesday, President Biden confirmed that Americans were also among the hostages taken by Hamas, but he did not specify how many. “As president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world,” Biden said. “Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond and indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks.”\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said there are 20 American citizens unaccounted for, at least some of whom are Hamas hostages. That puts the U. S. government in uncharted territory as it seeks the safe return of large numbers of its citizens from Gaza. Biden said Monday that he had directed his team members to work with their Israeli counterparts on “every aspect of the hostage crisis.”\n\nAmericans killed or missing in the attacks include tourists visiting Israel; U. S. citizens serving in the Israeli army; people born in the United States who immigrated to Israel; and children born in Israel to American parents who then acquired U.S. citizenship, like Katsman. They range in age from 18 to 80. It is unclear whether any American citizens have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\nJudith Raanan, 59, and her daughter Natalie, 18, live in Evanston, Ill., and were visiting relatives at a kibbutz near Gaza. Natalie had just graduated from Deerfield High School, where she was known as a talented artist. On Saturday, Natalie’s father, Uri, received a message from his daughter that said they were under attack. Then nothing, relatives said, weeping as they spoke with a reporter.\n\nAmericans were also among the revelers at an open-air trance music festival that turned into a scene of carnage. Danielle Ben-Senyor, 34, was born in Los Angeles and moved to Israel so her ailing parents could be closer to family members, said her cousin Riki Ben-Senyor. Early Saturday, Danielle, who had worked as an intensive-care nurse during the pandemic, left Tel Aviv with a group of friends to attend the music festival.\n\nGoldberg-Polin was born in California and his parents grew up in Chicago. They learned from eyewitnesses that he fled the festival in a car and sought safety in a public bomb shelter. About 30 people were in the small cement structure when they were attacked by militants, who threw grenades and fired weapons. Then they told anyone who could stand to walk outside.\n\nA witness saw Goldberg-Polin walk out, his mother said. He was missing his arm from his elbow down and had improvised a tourniquet. He was loaded onto a pickup truck with three other young men and two women. Israeli police traced the last signal from his cellphone to the border with Gaza.\n\nGoldberg addressed a news conference Tuesday along with relatives of three other missing Americans, where they urged the U. S. government to do everything in its power to find their loved ones. Jonathan Dekel-Chen’s son Sagui, 35, disappeared after an attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the family lived. Dekel-Chen said he knew of at least three other American citizens from their kibbutz who were missing and two other Americans who were killed.\n\nKatsman won a prize for an academic paper he wrote about contemporary religious Zionism, the focus of his research. “I really think his work helped illuminate some of the very dynamics that have brought us to this horrific moment,” said Liora Halperin, a historian at the University of Washington. “There are many pieces to this puzzle, but he had devoted years of his life trying to understand some of the pieces.”\n\nKatsman had a “very deep concern for all the residents of Israel and the Palestinian territories,” said Devin Naar, another historian at the university who asked Katsman to be his teaching and research assistant. Katsman didn’t despair but retained a kind of hope and optimism that a different future was possible, Naar said. He then stopped speaking, overcome by emotion.\n\nWacholder Katsman has not yet been able to arrange her son’s funeral amid the chaos of so many deaths. But she knows one thing. He “wouldn’t want this conflict to be used to kill innocent people,” she said. “He would want this conflict to end as soon as possible.”",

  "text": "Return to menu\n\nOmer Wenkert traveled to the Tribe of Nova music festival on Saturday morning, just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip. About 6:30 a.m., he called his family. The night of dancing and revelry was transforming into a massacre. Wenkert, according to his uncle Ricardo Grichner, who had a family dinner with him the night before, told relatives he could hear shooting but was unable to find a way out. In a text sent shortly before 8 a.m., he said he felt scared and helpless. Then he stopped picking up his phone.\n\nHis family wasn’t sure he was alive, as reports from the scene showed Hamas militants dressed in black shooting into the crowd, overrunning the site and grabbing hostages. Survivors described gunmen blocking escape routes, ambushing those who made it out.\n\nThen, that evening, his father received a copy of a video clip shared on Telegram. The footage, which has been independently verified by The Post, showed Wenkert on the back of a white pickup truck, stripped to his underwear, with his hands tied behind his back. Around him, men dressed in military garb shoot into the air as the vehicle speeds off.\n\n“The good news was that he was alive,” Grichner said, recalling the moment he saw the clip for the first time. “There are no nice words to say what you can see in the movie. … They are basically pointing a gun at Omer and beating him with several guns. You can see him trying to protect his head.”\n\nA Post analysis of the footage confirmed that the video was recorded inside the Gaza Strip, about 3½ miles from the site of the festival, just across the fence that separates it from southern Israel. The angles of the shadows show that the video was recorded in the morning — suggesting that the kidnappers took him into Gaza between 8 a.m. and noon on Saturday.\n\nWenkert lives with his family in the central Israeli town of Gedera, where his uncle said he works nearby as a restaurant manager. “He is a very happy guy. Very hardworking, very nice, very thoughtful,” he said. The family is concerned that in captivity, he may not receive vital prescribed medication for a stomach condition.\n\n“I hope the government will come to its senses,” Grichner added, “and somehow get Omer and all the other captives back alive.”",

  "text": "Torres looked outside and caught a glimpse of men on a motorcycle, brandishing assault rifles. One of them shot at the window, and Torres ran into the shelter for cover. Many homes in Israel bordering the Gaza Strip are equipped with safe rooms to use as shelter from incoming rockets.\n\nThe gunmen were soon battering at the door, and as they crashed through, Torres darted from the safe room, grabbed her lola from the bathroom and pulled her into the shelter, slamming the door shut. The sounds of gunshots were everywhere.\n\n“If I didn’t, she would be dead,” said Torres, 25. Together they waited in the reinforced shelter for 35 hours while gunshots echoed outside, a sign of the terrible slaughter being inflicted. “I wouldn’t be able to take it if I left my employer outside.”\n\nAmid the horrific stories of Israeli communities murdered and people carried off as hostages by the Hamas attackers, the acute vulnerability of Israel’s tens of thousands of migrant workers, many from Southeast Asia, has often been overlooked.\n\nAt least two Filipinos have been confirmed killed so far in southern Israel, according to the Philippine government. They worked as caregivers and died with their employers, overseas community organizers told The Washington Post. About two-thirds of the 30,000 Filipinos in Israel perform care work.\n\nAt least 21 Thai workers have been killed so far as well, and 14 others have been taken hostage, the Thai government has reported. About 30,000 Thai citizens work in Israel, overwhelmingly in the agricultural sector.\n\nThe global agricultural industry is already one of the most hazardous, failing to meet international standards on basic rights and often exploiting the vulnerability of migrant workers, labor rights advocates say. “It’s exacerbated when it takes place in conflict zones,” said David Welsh, Thailand country director of Solidarity Center, an international labor rights organization.\n\nThe Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it has called for the safe release of its citizens and reached out to Palestinian authorities to help facilitate this. Both the Philippines and Thailand have condemned the violence in broad terms.\n\nSurachai Seehajumpa, 40, came to Israel last year to pay off debts and save up to buy property. Work at his farm around 60 miles from Gaza carries on as usual — but he and his colleagues now can hear explosions in the distance. He regularly checks the news to see how the violence is escalating and decide whether it is time to join 5,000 other Thai nationals seeking passage home.\n\nA laborer in Israel can earn around $1,300 a month, about five times more than minimum wage in Thailand.  Surachai’s farm recently took in two other Thai workers fleeing violence. For now, he and his 10 companions have no interest in returning home.\n\nProtections for migrant workers depend on their contracts, relationships with employers and government schemes, said Filipino social worker and volunteer Agnes Hoffman, who has lived in Israel for 26 years. The ongoing conflict highlights the urgency of a longtime proposal from community leaders for the Philippine government to support a permanent shelter for temporary workers, she added.\n\n“There are always Filipinos who take in other Filipinos … but those aren’t their permanent homes,” said Hoffman, who also urged authorities to provide for psychological aid to shellshocked workers in their first language.\n\nSally Macadini, a 38-year-old Filipino caregiver, also managed to get her elderly employer into the safe room just as the attack happened. On the chat group she maintained with fellow caregivers, she found out that a colleague a few houses away had been unable save her employer, who was shot dead.\n\nShe watched the news on the television in the safe room, relaying updates to her fellow caregivers via chat. Many hours later, there was a banging on the door, but she and her employer stayed silent until she was informed on the group chat that the Israeli army had arrived.\n\nAs for whether she would leave Israel, she is still undecided. She said she felt an obligation both to the family she worked for in Israel, and her family relying on her support at home. “We’re in doubt knowing how hard life in the Philippines is,” Macadini said. “If we go home, how do we make a living?”",

  "text": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces’ most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “every Hamas fighter” will be “destroyed,” while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n“I think they’re going to go back in, heavy, and it’s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,” said Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be “dragged out over a much longer period of time” than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities — including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people — have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would “end” the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be “impossible” for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an “integrated and coordinated attack” by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel’s offensive is “obviously going to be much larger” now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be “exponentially greater” than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in “dog fights” between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has “become very efficient” at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces’ advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas’s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn’t sustainable.\n\n“They didn’t want to go into Gaza again. They didn’t want to occupy it. They didn’t want to be responsible for administrating it,” Misztal said. “But now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?”\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel “at this time” — but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power.",

  "text": "The scene is being re-created across the country, as the families of more than 100 Israelis thought to be held captive inside of Gaza grow ever more desperate for information. In the absence of a government response, they are dreading the one most likely: a massive military operation, which they fear could put their loved ones in the firing line.\n\nSome families have already had their worst fears confirmed. Videos reviewed Monday by The Washington Post showed evidence that at least four people in the town of Be’eri were killed soon after being taken captive by Hamas.\n\nBut none of the previous episodes, experts say, compares with the mass kidnapping of children, grandparents and whole families, much of it captured on video and shared on social media. And none of the options the government may be considering are likely to end without more bloodshed, they said.\n\n“This is unprecedented. We’ve never had so many people taken and held in a hostile territory,” said Gershon Baskin, Israel’s back-channel negotiator in the Shalit case. “It’s a new reality, and it’s difficult to measure how society will respond to this.”\n\nHamas has said the hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations. Ahmed Abdul Hadi, Hamas’s representative in Lebanon, denied reports that the group was in talks with Qatar over a prisoner exchange: “There is nothing like that right now at all,” he told The Post on Monday. “It’s too early for this conversation.”\n\nIsrael’s intelligence in Gaza was thought to be effective until Saturday’s surprise attack, but even before that, Hamas had proved its determination to conceal hostages. On the day Shalit was released, the militants sent out more than 30 decoy vehicles, Baskin said. The captive wasn’t in any of them.\n\nThe multipronged attack, in which at least 800 people were killed, shattered Israel’s shaky but enduring coexistence with Hamas. The regular rocket launches and periodic wars were largely deemed an acceptable price for otherwise containing the militant group. Now the country appears unified in calling for a major military intervention, whatever the costs.\n\n“I think the Israeli public, from the far left to the far right, feels that the price of coexistence with Hamas is intolerable,” Orbach said.\n\nBoth experts thought a small-scale hostage deal was possible — the exchange of children, elderly and sick Israelis for female and ill Hamas prisoners, for example. But neither thought the hostages would keep Israel from launching an overwhelming attack on Gaza.\n\n“The public wants to go into Gaza and attack Hamas,” Orbach said. “The public also wants the hostages to be safely rescued. I don’t think they’ve come to terms with the inherent contradiction.”\n\nYaffa Adar, a resident of Nir-Oz, a kibbutz just miles from the Gaza border, last made contact from her basement at 9 a.m. Saturday, the day the family had plans to gather for the Sukkot holiday: “There are terrorists in the road,” she texted them.",

  "text": "ATLANTA — Just one day before jury selection was to begin in her criminal trial, Sidney Powell, a former member of Donald Trump’s legal team, pleaded guilty Thursday to illegally conspiring to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.Powell, a Dallas-based lawyer who espoused baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 vote and filed a litany of failed lawsuits challenging the results, admitted guilt to six misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with the performance of election duties. She was sentenced to six years’ probation and agreed to pay a $6,000 fine and $2,700 in restitution to the state of Georgia, turn over documents and testify truthfully in her co-defendants’ trials.\n\nShe is the second of Trump’s 18 co-defendants in the sprawling racketeering case to accept a plea deal and agree to testify against co-defendants. The other is bail bondsman Scott Hall. Both faced charges related to their involvement in a secretive effort to access and copy election software in rural Coffee County, Ga., about two hours south of Atlanta.\n\nPowell is the first person with direct ties to Trump and his inner circle to plead guilty in the Georgia case. That development could have far-reaching implications for the former president, who is facing state and federal charges tied to his efforts to reverse his 2020 election loss. Powell is an unnamed co-conspirator in the federal case against Trump.\n\nPowell attorney Brian Rafferty had claimed that his client had “nothing to do” with the breach in Coffee County, although he also has argued that what happened there was “authorized” by election officials there and not illegal.\n\nPowell agreed to plead guilty to all aspects of the conspiracy that prosecutors have alleged, including that she paid employees of SullivanStrickler to travel to Coffee County and copy voter data “without authority” and to “interfere with, hinder and delay” the duties of Misty Hampton, the Coffee County elections director who also has been charged in the Georgia case.\n\nShe was present at an infamous Oval Office meeting on Dec. 18, 2020, that featured a shouting match — and nearly blows — between a top White House lawyer and Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser who was helping Trump try to reverse his defeat.\n\nWhat remains unclear is how high up in the Trump campaign Powell’s actions regarding Coffee County were known and whether she will implicate co-defendants such as former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani or Trump himself when she testifies.\n\nOn Thursday, Assistant District Attorney Daysha Young of Fulton County indicated that Powell had given a video statement about the case, which was recorded Wednesday night, and that she would be sharing documents related to the Georgia investigation with the district attorney’s office. Young did not indicate the scope of what those documents cover.\n\nUnder the terms of Powell’s plea agreement, she is not allowed to speak to the media about the case or to others charged in the case.\n\nPowell is licensed to practice law in Texas, where critics have sought unsuccessfully so far to have her license revoked as a result of her involvement in Trump’s effort to reverse his defeat in 2020. Her plea of guilty Thursday could revive that effort. According to the State Bar of Texas, lawyers face “compulsory” discipline if they are placed on probation for a “serious” or “intentional” offense, including conspiracy.\n\nOn Thursday, Rafferty, Powell’s attorney, successfully pushed for language in his client’s plea agreement that specified that the crimes to which she was pleading guilty did not involve “moral turpitude” — a distinction that could help Powell retain her law license. Similar language was included in Hall’s plea deal, which would allow him to continue to operate a bail bond business under Georgia law.\n\nJury selection is still scheduled to proceed Friday for one of Powell’s co-defendants, the lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who is accused of helping orchestrate the meeting of contingent electors in December 2020 to cast electoral votes for Trump despite Joe Biden’s victory in the state.\n\nScott Grubman, a lawyer for Chesebro, declined to comment on Powell’s decision to plead guilty in the case and on an ABC News report that his client had rejected a plea offer from prosecutors. A spokesman for the Fulton County district attorney’s office also declined to comment on the report.\n\nIn addition to the allegations about Coffee County, the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-defendants conspired to steal the 2020 election through a pressure campaign that included cajoling state officials, harassing local election workers and urging illegitimate Trump electors to cast ballots in seven states that Biden won. Ultimately, the indictment alleges, the actions were aimed at persuading Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Trump electors’ votes and not those of Biden electors during the final certification of the electoral college results on Jan. 6, 2021.",

  "text": "“If major corporations are helping to give life to the ‘big lie’ years after the fact, they’re enabling the animating narrative of American domestic extremism to endure,” said Glick, who now serves as a policy counsel at the Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. “They should be doing everything they can to stop the ‘big lie’ in its tracks, lest we see history repeat itself.”\n\nThere is limited information on how voice assistants may spread misinformation, yet some researchers argue they could be particularly effective vectors for falsehoods. Users have “higher trust” in the assistants due to their humanlike characteristics, according to a paper written by researchers at King’s College London. Customers may also think the information they’re getting is coming directly from the tech companies, rather than a third-party provider, making it seem more reliable, according to the paper.\n\nThe system is not always incorrect. When asked “Who won the 2020 election?” the assistant correctly answers “Democrat Joe Biden,” citing election results from Reuters. Changing the phrasing of a question can elicit different responses, which are at times accurate. When asked if the 2020 election results were fraudulent, Alexa says, “There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election — in Pennsylvania or anywhere else,” referencing CNN.\n\nDevelopers “often think that they have to give a balanced viewpoint and they do this by alternating between pulling sources from right and left, thinking this is going to give balance,” Broussard said. “The most popular sources on the left and right vary dramatically in quality.”\n\nSuch attempts can be fraught. Earlier this week,  media company the Messenger announced a new partnership with AI company Seekr to “eliminate bias” in the news. Yet Seekr’s website characterizes some articles from the pro-Trump news network One America News as “center” and as having “very high” reliability. Meanwhile, several articles from the Associated Press were rated “very low.”\n\nIt’s unclear how long Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant has been serving up false claims in response to questions about the 2020 election. Broussard said it’s also possible the answers reflect Amazon’s divestment in the current version of Alexa, as the company seeks to reboot its voice assistant. (A September Washington Post review found that the new version of Alexa, a cross between the assistant and ChatGPT, repeatedly got questions wrong.)",

  "text": "The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re’im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.\n\nAt least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.\n\nThe attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. “The event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,” ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.\n\nThe festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.\n\nBen Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. “I took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,” she said. “The people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.”\n\nThey drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.\n\nOn Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.\n\nArgamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. “If she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn’t have gone, but we knew nothing,” Marciano said. “She wasn’t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, ‘Go; you’re young.’ I regret that.”\n\nIn the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, “Allahu akbar!” A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair.",

The militaries in Sudan and Myanmar pulled the plug when they carried out armed coups in 2021. Iran flipped the switch when protesters flooded the streets following the death a year ago of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, in police custody. But the country that most frequently deploys the tactic is not an authoritarian state such as Russia or China, digital rights groups say.Between 2016 and this May, India accounted for more than half of all the shutdowns recorded worldwide by an international coalition of more than 300 digital rights groups led by Access Now, a nonprofit. On more than 680 occasions during that period, state and local officials in India issued legal orders requiring the country’s handful of telecommunication companies to suspend mobile data transmission from cell towers and freeze wired broadband connections.Skip to end of carouselThe rise of Modi and his Hindu-first stateIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept into power nearly a decade ago. Since then, he has repeatedly rallied voters in this vast democracy and entrenched his party’s power by exploiting differences between the Hindu majority and Muslim minority.Religious tensions have existed in India since independence in 1947, and Modi’s right-wing followers in his Bharatiya Janata Party and beyond turned to inflammatory rhetoric and violence against Muslims to secure support from Hindus.The BJP and affiliated Hindu nationalist groups have been in the global vanguard of using technology to advance  political aims, tightening their grip with an ideology that imperils India’s traditional secularism and equality among religious faiths. Disinformation and divisive, often bigoted online posts and videos are rampant.Government censorship of critical views has been on the rise. Social media platforms and other Big Tech firms, protective of their position in one of the world’s largest markets, have often given Modi and his allies what they want.Despite concerns over repression and accelerating autocracy, the Biden administration has been actively courting Modi, hoping that India can help contain Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.Canada’s explosive announcement on Sept. 18 that Indian government agents may have assassinated a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil underscores the uncomfortable choices the United States and other Western countries face in moving closer to Modi’s India.Indian officials argue that the measure is necessary to prevent the spread of online rumors and contain unrest. But by enforcing a digital blackout, critics say, the government can stifle dissent, cover up abuses and stymie independent reporting that challenges official accounts during times of conflict. The tactic can also exact a drastic, far-reaching economic toll, disrupting commerce, work and education.In a report last year about the global use of blackouts, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that the practice infringes on basic rights of expression and may do more harm than good during times of upheaval. “The inability to access tools to document and rapidly report abuses seems to contribute to further violence, including atrocities,” the U.N. agency said. “Some shutdowns may even be implemented with the deliberate intent of covering up human rights violations.”Since May, when ethnic bloodshed erupted in Manipur state, in northeast India, the state government controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has enforced a draconian internet ban affecting the state’s 3 million people — one of the longest recorded shutdowns in the world — as violence between two ethnic groups spread from village to village, leaving more than 200 dead.In three visits to the remote, lushly forested state bordering Myanmar, Washington Post journalists saw how severing the internet — considered a modern necessity, almost a basic right by many — upended daily lives and livelihoods practically overnight. Countless workers found themselves out on the street, and hospitals, with online payment systems suspended, struggled to keep operating.Moreover, the internet shutdown shaped the Manipur conflict in profound ways. It allowed the BJP state government — and the state’s ethnic Meitei majority who control it — to dominate the public narrative about the turmoil. It impeded efforts by dissenters among the Kuki ethnic minority to spread their message and disseminate photo and video evidence of human rights abuses. And it effectively kept the roiling conflict, a stark challenge to the BJP’s leadership, behind a veil of invisibility.While local governments ruled by opposition parties in India also frequently block the internet, the Manipur example highlights a wider pattern in an India governed over the past decade by Modi’s BJP. To maintain their grip on political power and advance their Hindu nationalist agenda, Modi and his ideological allies have often used their control of technology and social media to stifle dissent, promote divisive propaganda — or, in the case of Manipur, pull the digital plug altogether.After a viral video emerged online in July of Kuki women being groped and paraded naked in a Meitei village, drawing international attention and concern about sexual violence in the Manipur conflict, several BJP leaders, including the state’s chief minister, N. Biren Singh, voiced frustration that the video had surfaced and alleged in media interviews that it had been intentionally “leaked” from Manipur to hurt them politically. The chief minister’s office and spokespeople for the Manipur state government declined multiple interview requests for this article.To pierce the information veil, Kuki activists this year mounted a digital resistance.Some secretly connected internet cables from an adjacent state to a college campus, where they huddled to spread word of their people’s plight. Others pursued old-school, shoe-leather journalism, forming teams to visit refugee camps and document allegations of war crimes, and collected evidence by transferring videos via Bluetooth or USB drives. Still others drove hours to the border, where they tapped into the faint cellphone signal  to download independent commentary about the conflict.On a Sunday morning in early July, one of these activists stood in a crowd and she listened intently to dozens of exhausted Kuki villagers recounting a terrifying tale.Before sunrise that day, the displaced Kukis said, an armed mob of Meiteis had appeared, setting fire to their homes in the nearby foothills. Then the villagers made a stunning allegation: A 30-year-old Kuki named David Thiek was decapitated, his limbs sawed off and his head placed on a bamboo spike.The activist — a former call center manager with a bubbly laugh and quiet intensity named Jhmar — belonged to the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF), a pro-Kuki organization, as a volunteer in its “media cell.” Her job, she said, was to find and confirm reports about atrocities, then spread the word to the outside world, a challenge given the internet ban. But here, a nugget of firsthand information had found its way to her. (Jhmar recounted the episode on the condition that she be identified only by her tribal name, fearing government retribution.)She immediately hopped on a motorbike and rode off into the hills.Since 2020, India has been the leader in ordering internet shutdowns, far outpacing Iran and Myanmar, in second and third spots, respectively, according to Access Now. Indian government officials can issue blocking orders that cover relatively small districts or encompass vast states with millions of people. The blackouts tend to last for a few days, though they’re often renewed, and some stretch on for months.Two months ago, a shutdown was imposed in Haryana state, ostensibly to control riots, and a blackout in March, affecting 27 million people, was enforced in Punjab state during efforts to catch fugitives. In February, the internet was blocked in 11 cities in Rajasthan state to prevent cheating during exams.The longest recorded instance came in August 2019, when the Modi government revoked the semiautonomous status of the northern Jammu and Kashmir region and brought this restive Muslim-majority area directly under New Delhi’s control, sparking protests and an Indian army crackdown that included waves of detentions. The government cut phone lines and shut down high-speed internet for 18 months to curb what officials called the spread of disinformation from Pakistan.But with the flow of information severed and journalists unable to work, it took weeks for allegations to surface that the Indian army had tortured detainees, among them minors, said Anuradha Bhasin, the executive editor of the Kashmir Times who is now a fellow at Stanford University.“Seven million people in Kashmir and Muslim-majority areas of Jammu were completely pushed behind an iron curtain,” said Bhasin. “Shutting down critical reporting was one of the intended consequences.”After Bhasin challenged the internet shutdown in court, the Indian Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the tactic should be used only for a limited time and only if absolutely essential, adding that the justification must be publicized. But authorities often ignore the court’s recommendations, say Indian civil rights lawyers.The unrest in Manipur began on April 27. Kuki activists called for a general strike against the land policies of the state’s chief minister that day, and the demonstration turned violent.Tensions had been brewing for months between the Kukis, a Christian hill tribe, and Meiteis, the politically and economically dominant valley dwellers who mostly practice Hinduism. Kukis have long accused Meiteis of coveting land in the hills reserved under the Indian constitution for tribal peoples, and those fears sharpened this spring when the state’s top court backed a Meitei demand that it also be granted official tribal status.At first, the state government ordered an internet blackout around Churachandpur, a city that forms the heart of Manipur’s Kuki population. But mayhem erupted anyway. On May 3, mob violence spread statewide, leading to two days of killing, rape and arson. While both sides were targeted, most victims were Kuki, according to the U.N. human rights office. Roaming death squads killed anyone they could find of the other ethnicity. Up to 60,000 people were displaced.The state ordered telecom providers to kill the internet, and  a digital darkness fell over Manipur. The resistance began.Getting the word outFor Ginza Vualzong, a gregarious leader in the pro-Kuki ITLF who heads its “media cell,” the first task was tracking down a local technician who quietly dealt in special phone lines — an internet bootlegger. After weeks of negotiations, an eye-watering payment exceeding $1,000 and a flick of a router switch one day in late May, Vualzong turned the media cell office in Churachandpur into an oasis of WiFi, with slow, finicky, but unfettered internet piped in from a neighboring state.To counter stories in newspapers and carried by television stations under the BJP government’s sway, one volunteer assembled a news bulletin every day and distributed hard copies to curious readers who queued up for them. Another team visited hospitals and camps for displaced people to document war crime allegations and uploaded oral histories to YouTube.“What we’re fighting is a narrative war,” said Vualzong, who described most of his day-to-day work as “firefighting” against government propaganda.As the conflict raged, the Indian government prohibited foreign journalists from visiting Manipur. In the Indian media, it was mostly English-language newspapers with relatively few readers and small, online-only news outlets that closely covered both sides of the conflict.But with its secret internet line, the media cell managed to score small victories. In July, Jhmar and her team facilitated an interview involving a Kuki woman, who was beaten nearly to death by a mob, and a writer for the popular Instagram page Humans of Bombay — an Indian account inspired by Humans of New York with 3 million followers.The post got 21,000 likes. It was nothing like making the front page of a national newspaper. But their people were starved of any outside attention, Jhmar said: “Every channel, be it small or big, is important for us right now.”As the media cell huddled daily near its office hotspot, life outside changed dramatically for millions of people plunged into an earlier technological era.At the Raj Medicity in Imphal, Manipur’s capital, hospital director Vijayraj Haobijam, 29, ticked off his mounting difficulties. Without internet access, he couldn’t receive timely reimbursements from the national health insurance program or digital payments from patients. His employees were working on half-salary.“Even the covid lockdowns were not so difficult because that was not a war,” he said. “We had internet.”Skip to end of carouselPart 1: Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and its Hindu nationalist allies have built a massive propaganda machine, with tens of thousands of activists spreading disinformation and religiously divisive posts via WhatsApp. Parent company Meta says WhatsApp cannot monitor content, no matter how inflammatory.Part 2: Social media giants have been reluctant to police Indian content that violates their terms of service. After Facebook discovered a vast influence operation using fake accounts secretly operated by the Indian army, some company employees moved to shut it down, but executives in the New Delhi office stalled the action.Part 3: A new generation of Hindu vigilantes frequently stream their armed attacks against Muslims on platforms like YouTube and Facebook, amassing large followings and winning BJP protection. While rights activists have repeatedly flagged hateful influencers to social media companies, the accounts are rarely removed.Part 4: India orders internet shutdowns more than any other country, blacking out entire states for weeks and even months at a time. By pulling the plug, the government is able to stifle dissent, drown out negative news and obstruct journalists from doing independent reporting — often at a high economic cost.Part 5: The Indian government has dramatically increased the demands it makes of Silicon Valley firms to take down social media posts and accounts, in particular those critical of Modi and the BJP. Companies that once pushed back now routinely comply, and nowhere has the shift been more notable than at Twitter.Part 6: Hindu nationalists aligned with the BJP government use mass public pressure and the threat of criminal cases to shape or entirely block films produced by Netflix and Amazon, resulting in a culture of self-censorship. The companies and filmmakers increasingly steer clear of projects that could offend the right wing.Part 7: An Indian research organization that often targets U.S.-based critics of the Modi government is actually a covert influence operation run by an Indian intelligence officer, people familiar with it say. The material published by the Disinfo Lab, though often unsubstantiated, is widely circulated online by right-wing Indians.Part 8: After Apple alerted Indian critics of the Modi administration that their iPhones had probably been targeted by state-sponsored attackers, Indian officials privately pressured Apple to backtrack on the warning. Subsequent forensic analysis confirmed spyware infections among Indian journalists and opposition politicians.On the boulevards of Imphal, the stately former seat of the Meitei monarchy, long lines snaked out from ATMs, because the demand for cash skyrocketed after India’s digital payments system suddenly became unavailable. The back streets were devoid of the food and package delivery boys ubiquitous even in small Indian towns, because the e-commerce companies paused local services. The offices that provide the white-collar jobs so many Indians aspire to were shuttered overnight.Grunting and sweating outside a water packaging plant in Churachandpur, Janet Lalthiengzo, 27, wrapped a dozen bottles and heaved the package onto a truck — a job she never imagined she’d be doing after graduating from college and working for a company doing search engine optimization. But with the internet severed, Lalthiengzo found herself packing water bottles for $3 a day, a third of what she once made.“Even if I get paid less, I have to work,” said Lalthiengzo.On a recent evening, three Kukis gathered on a grassy hilltop bathed in moonlight. Locals knew it was possible to pick up a faint cellphone signal, but no one knew if it came from the neighboring state of Mizoram or Myanmar.Siamkhanlal, 51, yelped with delight as 46 messages came flooding into his WhatsApp at once. He needed to download pay slips for his church group. People came to the hill for all kinds of reasons, he explained: to do homework, make payments or download the latest information about the fighting.Another villager, O.K. Luna, wasn’t so lucky. He wanted a glimpse of his daughter Margaret, who had flown that morning to Italy to resume her job on a cruise liner. He clutched a phone in each hand, cajoling them to connect. He gave up after more than 90 minutes.On May 4 — the second and, by most accounts, worst day of fighting — came a defining moment of the Manipur conflict.A 26-second video showing dozens of Meitei men that day molesting two naked Kuki women, grabbing their genitals as they were paraded down a narrow concrete road and into dry paddy fields. There, relatives of the Kuki women alleged, they were raped off-camera.For two and a half months, the video never surfaced. No arrests were made, no headlines created. But finally, the video made its way to social media. Instantly, it had an impact.A body of U.N. human rights experts expressed alarm about what was happening on the ground. Modi, who had stayed away from Manipur and remained quiet about the conflict since it erupted, broke his silence after 78 days, telling the Indian people that “what has happened to these daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven.” The wheels of justice finally began to churn. Seven men were detained within days and handed to the federal investigative agency.In a country where national politics is often driven by spectacle and social media outrage, capturing and sharing visuals is “the only time you are getting a response from those in power,” said Sevanti Ninan, a longtime media critic. “Manipur has long been invisible partly because of the mainland attitude to that state. The internet shutdown makes it further invisible.”But on the Meitei side, the emergence of the video fueled bewilderment and frustration.Along the rain-soaked rice paddies of Pechi village, near where the video was shot, Meiteis wondered why they were denied internet when they too were regularly assaulted.Two fuming Meitei women, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address an incident that they said unfairly tarnished their village name, stopped sowing rice to vent. The attack on the Kuki women, they said, was in revenge for a rumored attack on Meitei girls.Yet “the narrative is one-sided against us,” said one of the women. “Without internet, we cannot get photos and videos of what happened to our people.”Khuraijam Athouba, the spokesperson of the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity, the top civilian group representing Meitei interests in the conflict, said the internet shutdown was making the conflict worse by fueling hoaxes and rumors. Even Meiteis detested it, he said.“People make more assumptions,” Athouba said, “because they are not getting the right information, at the right time.”As soon as she heard news of David Thiek’s July 2 death, Jhmar rushed on a motorbike to Saikot village, where Thiek’s family were seeking refuge after fleeing their home in Langza, 20 miles away.Details were still trickling in about the pre-dawn attack on Langza. As waves of refugees arrived throughout the day, they brought more photos and videos that created, piece by piece, a fuller, terrifying account of destruction and savagery.Videos showed Kuki volunteers rummaging through rubble, searching for Thiek’s remains. They gathered his charred bones and placed them on a traditional stole spread on the ground. One photo showed the blood-streaked bamboo fence where his head had been mounted.Jhmar used Nearby Share, a Bluetooth file-sharing app, to gather every photo and video she could from Thiek’s friends, family and witnesses. For a week, she worked with her media cell colleagues to put together a memorial video. The group released it on their YouTube channel on July 13.On July 24, Jhmar scored another small win. A team from CNN-News 18, a national TV network, caught wind of Thiek’s killing, and Jhmar brought the crew to interview his family. But after that, outside attention fizzled out again.On Sept. 2, the Editors Guild of India, a professional group of journalists that had visited Manipur on a fact-finding mission, released a report saying the internet ban had impeded the work of journalists, who were forced to rely “almost entirely on the narrative of the state government” and produced shoddy, one-sided reporting.Two days later, the Manipur government filed a criminal case against the editors association for “promoting enmity between different groups.”Mobile internet was briefly restored on Sept. 23, and disturbing photos immediately surfaced on social media, this time showing the corpses of two young Meiteis allegedly killed by Kukis. Authorities arrested the suspected killers before severing the internet again on Sept. 26.In Churachandpur, Jhmar fell into a gloom. She felt she hadn’t done enough to spread word about the violence. How could she, given Manipur’s internet outage that began in early May?Jhmar said her only consolation was that Thiek’s slaying had been documented, saved for a day of reckoning when the digital darkness lifts.“The only thing we can do,” she said, “is keep bringing out the stories as much as we can so that the world knows.”Shih reported from New Delhi.

  "text": "The Palestinian boy who had been knifed to death on Saturday was 6 — the same age as her son — so Fidaa Elaydi imposed a new rule: No more playing outside. She used to feel safe in Bridgeview, a Chicago suburb full of Middle Eastern eateries and Muslim clothing boutiques that was known as Little Palestine. Then the Palestinian militant group Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.\n\nIn the 10 days since the rampage by Hamas fighters and Israel’s full-scale counterstrike targeting the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, a spate of headlines has validated her fears. In Boston, somebody spray-painted “Nazis” on a sign for a Palestinian cultural center. In Dearborn, Mich., police arrested a man who allegedly urged his Facebook friends to “hunt Palestinians.” And barely 25 miles from Elaydi’s house, a landlord is accused of stabbing his tenants, gravely wounding the mother and killing her son, with authorities linking his assault “to them being Muslims and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.”\n\nPalestinians in the United States, half a world away from the carnage in the Middle East, say they are canceling dinners out, taking time off work and staying home. Some are getting ominous emails and messages on social media. Others say the environment seems so charged, they’re afraid to openly express concern for loved ones trapped in Gaza as Israel pushes to eradicate the militants responsible for the Oct. 7 massacre of soldiers and civilians.\n\nAnguish for family members in Gaza only heightened the anxiety after a strike Tuesday set a hospital ablaze. Palestinian and Israeli officials traded blame for the attack. The only certainty: Hundreds may have been killed, adding to the death toll of about 3,000 Palestinians.\n\nThose who argue for a Palestinian state, a decades-old cause, say they are being framed as cheerleading “Hamas’s genocidal war,” as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) phrased it in a letter to the Justice Department. Hawley called for an investigation of student groups organizing pro-Palestinian rallies.\n\nThe bloodshed overseas is sowing panic in communities across the country, with the FBI saying it is tracking a spike in threats against both Muslim and Jewish Americans. The agency warned that bad actors could “exploit the conflict” and provoke violence “on our own soil.” Mosques and synagogues have beefed up security. Some private Jewish day schools shuttered last week after a former Hamas leader called for a “day of jihad.”\n\nHundreds of Arab Americans gathered at a mosque in Bridgeview on Monday for the funeral of the 6-year-old boy, Wadea Alfayoumi, who had been stabbed 26 times, the sheriff’s office said. Outside, speakers called on lawmakers to address the conflict with context and nuance. Some demanded an apology from President Biden, whom they accused of inflaming tensions with his comment about seeing photos of Hamas fighters beheading children — a claim the White House later walked back.\n\nOne attended a pro-Palestinian rally on campus last week where strangers started filming the students, Othman said, and she advised her to not engage with anyone who seemed hostile. She doesn’t want her daughters to limit their freedom of speech, though.\n\nRanda Mohammad, a student-support coordinator at a middle school in Dearborn, is following the news with a growing sense of dread. Five of her relatives — her sister-in-law’s cousins — were killed in Gaza while trying to help civilians who had been ordered to evacuate, she said. When videos of the hospital attack reached her phone, she hid in the garage so her children wouldn’t see her cry.\n\nMore than half of Dearborn’s residents are Arab American. Familial ties to Gaza and the West Bank run deep. People love to snack on flaky, cheese-layered kunafa at the beloved Palestinian bakery. And, Mohammad said, everyone is on edge.\n\nThe police presence outside her school has been heavier than normal, she noted; officers arrested a 41-year-old man last week who had posted on social media about hunting Palestinians. On Monday, a 12-year-old student came to her with a question.\n\nThe Arab American Political Action Committee canceled a banquet scheduled for Wednesday in Dearborn, accusing American leaders of endorsing bloodshed by not “doing the bare minimum of calling for a cease fire.” The organizers also harbored security concerns, according to Osama Siblani, a Lebanese journalist on the board of directors. Palestinians as a group, he said, are too often portrayed as the enemy.",

  "text": "Lawmakers on Wednesday pressed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on the company’s plans to prevent the spread of misinformation ahead of the 2024 election, citing a Washington Post report that the company’s voice assistant Alexa spread false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee chair, and Rep. Joseph Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, asked Bezos in a letter to explain what steps have been taken to improve the accuracy of Alexa’s responses. The Minnesota and New York Democrats also pressed Bezos on how the company is vetting responses that cite Alexa users as source material — especially when the inquiries are related to elections.\n\n“This spreading of election-related misinformation and disinformation is particularly troubling given the emerging use of artificial intelligence to mislead voters,” the lawmakers wrote.\n\nAfter years of concern about the spread of voting-related falsehoods on social media, members of Congress are turning their attention to the threat of AI, which could supercharge online misinformation. Much of the debate has focused on the ways AI could be used to manipulate photos, videos and audio recordings, but the Alexa responses underscore how voice assistants and chatbots that draw responses from unvetted sources could also be a potent vector.\n\nWhen asked whether the 2020 election was stolen, the popular voice assistant said there was “a massive amount of election fraud,” citing Rumble, a video-streaming service favored by conservatives, The Post found. The voice assistant also falsely claimed that Trump won Pennsylvania in 2020, and that the races were “notorious” for “indications pointing to electoral fraud taking place in major metro centers.”\n\nAmazon declined to comment on the letter. The company previously told The Post that the responses were “errors” that were quickly fixed. But in the days after those changes, The Post and readers reported that Alexa still made false claims about the 2020 elections when the questions were asked in slightly different ways.\n\nShortly after The Post’s reporting published, Amazon spokeswoman Lauren Raemhild sent an advisory to employees, saying the report was based on “three bad responses,” according to an email viewed by The Post. Raemhild said the company’s Alexa information team worked with its support team to investigate and block the bad responses.\n\nThe lawmakers warned Bezos that the company needs to act expediently and asked for a response by Nov. 3.\n\n“With some ballots for the 2024 election being sent out as early as this December, it is important that proactive measures are promptly taken so that voters can trust the information that is provided to them,” the lawmakers wrote.",

It expressed “deep concern” while condemning attacks on civilians “wherever they may be.” But one of Morocco’s largest parties in Parliament called Hamas’s actions “heroic” and a “legitimate reaction to daily violations.”\n\nSudan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement published by the official Sudan News Agency that the violence stemmed from a decline in international interest in the Palestinian issue. Sudan signed the Abraham Accords in 2021.\n\n“Sudan renews its support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to have their independent state,” the statement read.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has been in talks for months with Israel about a potential normalization agreement but is not part of the Abraham Accords, called for an immediate end to the violence. It did not explicitly denounce Hamas.\n\n“The Kingdom recalls its repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities,” the statement read.",

  "text": "“The United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during the conflict. And I grieve. I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy,” Biden said. Earlier in the day, the president said his assessment of responsibility was based on data shown to him by the U. S. Defense Department.\n\nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the U. S. government assessment was based on “available reporting, including intelligence, missile activity, overhead imagery, and open source video and images of the incident.” The intelligence, she said, indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion was caused by a rocket or missile launched by a militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. She said U.S. officials are working to corroborate whether that is the case.\n\nSince the hospital was devastated Tuesday by a strike that Palestinian authorities said killed hundreds of people, Israel and the United States have been the targets of rage, condemnation and protest that have surged across the Middle East. Wednesday’s statements by Israel and the United States that a Palestinian militant group was responsible for the blast may carry little weight with Arab protesters.\n\nAmong the most useful pieces of information in identifying who may be responsible for a strike are infrared signatures from satellites, which may have detected a rocket launch as opposed to an aerial bombing, one U. S. official said. Images of the impact site, as well as any fragments recovered, could also help identify who was responsible, the official said.\n\nThe U. S. conclusion appeared to do little to assuage anger in Arab and Muslim countries, where people generally harbor deep distrust of Israel and the United States. Israel’s army in the past has blamed Palestinian militants for strikes and civilian deaths and then later acknowledged it was probably at fault, such as in the death of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.\n\nIn Amman, Jordan, Biden had been scheduled to meet with the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to discuss the conflict and the need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. The White House said Biden would continue to be in touch with those leaders, but the meeting’s cancellation was a setback to the president’s diplomatic efforts.\n\n“For the people of Israel, there’s only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel, and that is having you standing in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war, and it is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel.”",

  "text": "Biden announced that a deal had been struck with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to flow from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million people face relentless airstrikes and an Israeli siege. Supplies of food, drinking water and fuel are dwindling by the hour. Despite the apparent breakthrough, Biden said the aid would not start arriving until Friday at the earliest.\n\nConcerned that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a broader regional conflict, the White House has tried to assure Arab partners that it will use its influence to protect innocent Gazans. Conditions in the enclave — already one of the poorest and most densely populated places in the world — are deteriorating rapidly. More than 3,000 people have been killed by airstrikes. Local hospitals are collapsing.\n\nBiden spent a little over seven hours in Israel, where he was greeted on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two men — whose decades-long relationship has been tested this year — shared a brief hug. Biden spent more than two hours at a meeting of the Israeli war cabinet before speaking with survivors of the attacks and families of victims and hostages.\n\nNetanyahu emphasized Wednesday that Israel would not permit the transfer of any humanitarian aid to Gaza from its own territory, but said it would not thwart the delivery of supplies from Egypt, provided it was limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” — and so long as none of it reached Hamas.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday called on residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the town of al-Mawasi, the latest in a series of recent directives urging Gazans to move south, even though most have nowhere to stay. The United Nations has warned that the evacuation orders may violate international law.\n\nThere was little acknowledgment in the region of Israel’s denial of responsibility for the hospital strike, or of Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalizing ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”",

  "text": "But any sense of public comity between Washington and its Arab partners was shattered Tuesday as gruesome images emerged at the site of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian authorities say an Israeli airstrike killed up to 500 people in the attack. Israel denies the charge, saying the facility was blown up by errant rocket fire from an Islamist militant group. The White House, citing preliminary U. S. intelligence, has sided with Israel.\n\nThe hospital blast has “derailed a much-needed opportunity to make meaningful progress on the near-term solution to the Gaza crisis,” said Suzanne Maloney, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. “And by inflaming opinion across the Arab world, it has heightened prospects for escalation and a much more dangerous and protracted conflict in the region.”\n\nWhen asked what made him think that, Biden cited the “data I was shown by my Defense Department,” without elaborating. The National Security Council later issued a statement attributing the U. S. intelligence assessment to “overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information,” though so far it has not publicly disclosed any of those materials.\n\nThe United States switched, for instance, its policy seeking safe passage for Palestinian civilians through Egypt in response to meetings with Abbas and Sisi, who opposed the proposal out of fear that fleeing Palestinians may never be able to return to Gaza.\n\nThat led up to what Biden announced on Wednesday: an agreement with Israel to allow the delivery of aid on the condition that there will be inspections and that the aid won’t go to Hamas. “Israel agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move,” Biden said.\n\nBut a critical player on aid delivery is Egypt, which controls part of the Rafah border crossing, and Hamas, which controls the other half. That is why Arab leaders, who have communication links with Hamas and other key players on the ground, were viewed as a critical part of Biden’s trip.",

  "text": "BEIRUT — Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel’s denial of responsibility, or Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”\n\nAn accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.",

  "text": "“I heard a lot of good ideas about some of the things we need to do moving forward,” Blinken told reporters on Sunday following his meetings with the two leaders. But differences of views emerged immediately on Israel’s right to wage a massive offensive in Gaza, which both Sisi and Mohammed raised concerns about.\n\nThe top U. S. diplomat is hopscotching the Middle East with the goal of convincing Arab partners to condemn Hamas’s horrific assault in Israel and refrain from stoking domestic unrest in response to Israel’s devastating bombing campaign in Gaza. The violence has resulted in the death of more than 1,300 Israelis and more than 2,600 Palestinians.\n\nOn Saturday, U. S. officials announced that they had reached an agreement with Cairo for a temporary opening at the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt for U.S. citizens seeking to flee the violence and Israeli bombardment. The announcement resulted in scores of the estimated 500- to 600 Palestinian Americans in Gaza rushing to the border, but none have been able to cross into Egypt amid contradictory remarks between U.S. and Egyptian officials about why the border won’t reopen.\n\nThe Rafah border crossing — the only egress that Israel does not control — has also remained closed to critical supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine that aid groups and friendly nations, with Egypt’s coordination, are trying to send into Gaza. Israeli airstrikes damaged the crossing last week, and Israel was unwilling to commit to not striking aid vehicles that enter Gaza, a diplomatic official told The Post Saturday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\n“Egypt has put in place a lot of material support for people in Gaza, and Rafah will be opened,” Blinken said about his discussions with Sisi on the border. “We’re putting in place with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel, with others, the mechanism by which to get the assistance in, and to get it to people who need it.”\n\n“You said that you are a Jewish person and I am an Egyptian person who grew up next to Jews in Egypt,” Sisi said. “They have never been subjected to any form of oppression or targeting and it has never happened in our region that Jews were targeted in recent or old history.”\n\nSisi, an authoritarian leader, has harshly cracked down on Islamists in Egypt. Still, Christian churches and religious leaders have frequently come under attack by Islamist extremists — and there are only a handful of Egyptian Jews left in the country. Tens of thousands of Jews left Egypt under pressure from the government of Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nWhile Sisi denounced Hamas’s assault on Israelis, he blamed Israel for driving Palestinians to desperation given the lack of progress toward a two-state solution. After Sisi met with his national security council earlier Sunday, his office put out a statement calling for an international summit “to study the future of the Palestinian cause.” Blinken told reporters he supported the idea but “we have to get through this crisis first.”\n\nAs the only country that maintains strong communications with Israel, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, Egypt has been a key interlocutor during past flare-ups of violence. Cairo brokered the cease-fire in May 2021 that ended an 11-day outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas that left more than 250 people dead.\n\nThat influence is a cornerstone of arguments in Cairo and in Washington for the continued provision of $1.3 billion in U. S. military aid to Egypt annually, despite the Sisi government’s abysmal human rights record. When Biden first came to office in 2021, pledging to put human rights at the center of his foreign policy, the bilateral relationship took a frostier turn. But when Egypt stepped in to mediate a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in May of that year, Biden phoned him twice in one week.\n\nThe Egyptian public is staunchly supportive of the Palestinian cause, and Egypt has pushed for a two-state solution to the long-simmering conflict. But Cairo, supremely concerned with internal security, has also played a role in enforcing Israel’s 16-year blockade of Gaza — particularly after Sisi took power in a military coup in 2013. In the early years of his presidency, Sisi was focused on stamping out the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and saw Hamas, with its Islamist orientation, as an ally of the Brotherhood, Elgindy said. The Israel-Gaza war in 2014 lasted for weeks in part because Cairo was “dragging its feet” to punish Hamas, he added.\n\nAs Israel continues to bombard Gaza, and pro-Palestinian protests around the world showcase the anger of the Arab street, Egypt has sought to be a voice of calm, calling on all parties to de-escalate and to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy, phoning world leaders and hosting top diplomats from countries including Turkey, Germany and Italy in Cairo to convey this message.",

  "text": "Over the same period, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 60 Palestinians in the West Bank and injured more than 1,300, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has also locked down parts of the West Bank, closing roads and putting up checkpoints to prevent Palestinians from moving between towns and cities.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in 1967. Under the Oslo accords, brokered by President Bill Clinton in 1993, those territories were meant to form a Palestinian state. But the U. S.-led peace process has been dormant for years. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded. Members of Israel’s current government, the most far-right in its history, have called openly for annexation.\n\nSince 2007, when Hamas violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip, Abbas has cracked down on supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza, as well as on his own critics. Long-promised elections have never been held. Despair has deepened in the impoverished refugee camps that still dot the West Bank.\n\nOver the past two years, camps in Nablus, Jenin and elsewhere have become incubators for a new generation of armed groups that have carried out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians. Israel has responded with massive military raids across the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians here since the end of the second intifada in 2005.\n\n“The worst is yet to come,” said the 38-year-old militant, a father of three, speaking on the condition that he be identified by his childhood nickname to protect his security. Zoufi said he awoke on Oct. 7 to the news of Hamas’s rampage and asked his wife to slap him to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. Then he laughed with joy.\n\nZoufi is affiliated with Fatah but opposes the Palestinian Authority’s nonviolent approach. He founded his militant cell last year. Balata is home to some 30,000 people and has no proper police force. The same is true in other camps in Nablus and Jenin and throughout the northern West Bank. In these communities, the militants are the ones in charge.\n\n“If Israel will do a stupid thing like the ground invasion, war will break out not only in the West Bank and inside Israel but also around the Arab world,” he said. “We want liberation, not bloodshed. ... I hope it will stop before it comes to that.”\n\nMohamed Hamdan, the secretary general of Fatah in Nablus, defended Abbas and his efforts to revive peace negotiations. He said the authority was doing its best to maintain order and rein in weapons on the street. But the international community had “betrayed” the Palestinians, he said.",

  "text": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden’s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country’s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza’s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael’s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n“We all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,” Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. “They go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid.",

  "text": "There’s little that unites the 25 House Republicans who denied Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) the speakership on Friday.\n\nThey include some of the most moderate Republicans in the House as well as one member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Some of them represent swing districts, and others hail from deep-red ones. And not all of them voted to certify the 2020 election.\n\nInstead, what binds many of the Republicans who blocked Jordan from becoming speaker was anger with the way he  and his team tried to browbeat them  into supporting him.\n\nMany of the 55 House Republicans who opposed Jordan in a closed-door meeting last week coordinated with each other to try to ensure that Jordan lost more support on each successive ballot.\n\nThe plan worked: Jordan lost 20 Republican votes on Tuesday, 22 on Wednesday and 25 on Friday. House Republicans then voted later on Friday by secret ballot behind closed doors to rescind the conference’s nomination from Jordan.\n\nHere are five different ways of looking  at the unusual coalition of Republicans who denied Jordan the speakership.\n\nMost of the Republicans who voted against Jordan on Friday  represent solidly Republican districts and had no reason to fear that supporting Jordan would threaten their  reelections (although voting against Jordan could hurt them in their primaries).\n\nBut nine of them represent districts that President Biden carried in 2020 — in some cases by big margins.\n\nBiden won the Long Island district of Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-N. Y.) — who voted three times  for former Republican congressman Lee Zeldin instead of Jordan — by nearly 15 points. He also won the swing district in New York City’s northern suburbs held by Rep. Michael Lawler (R-N.Y.) — who voted for Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the ousted speaker, twice before switching his allegiance to Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) — by more than 10 points.\n\nThe three Republicans who voted against Jordan on Friday after supporting him on the first two ballots — Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Thomas H. Kean (N. J.) and Marcus J. Molinaro (N.Y.) — all represent districts Biden won. So do Reps. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) and Jen A. Kiggans (R-Va.), who refused to back Jordan on all three ballots.\n\nAll of them are freshmen except Bacon and Fitzpatrick.\n\nNot all of them are equally vulnerable next year, though.\n\nThe Cook Political Report ranks Chavez-DeRemer’s, D’Esposito’s, Kean’s, Lawler’s and Molinaro’s races as toss-ups. Kiggans’s and Bacon’s races lean Republican, while Fitzpatrick’s and LaLota’s are  considered “likely Republican.”\n\nOne of the surprise votes against Jordan was House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Kay Granger (R-Tex.), a veteran lawmaker who refused to support him on all three ballots.\n\nSo did six other Republicans on her committee: Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (Fla.), Jake Ellzey (Tex.), Tony Gonzales (Tex.), John Rutherford (Fla.), Mike Simpson (Idaho) and Steve Womack (Ark.). All of them represent safe districts except for Rutherford, whose district the Cook Political Report considers a toss-up because of the uncertainty created by an ongoing redistricting lawsuit.\n\nWhile each appropriator had his or her own reasons for not backing Jordan — Diaz-Balart and Gonzales, for instance, are longtime allies of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), who was forced to drop out of the speaker race after some of Jordan’s allies wouldn’t support him — most of them are institutionalists who were likely put off by Jordan’s confrontational approach to cutting federal spending over the years.\n\nIt’s tough to parse which Republicans consider themselves moderates, because some lawmakers with relatively moderate voting records don’t like the label.\n\nBut one rough proxy is membership in the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, the most moderate  of the “five families” of the Republican conference.\n\nNearly half of the Republicans who voted against Jordan on Friday are members: Reps. Andrew R. Garbarino (R-N. Y.) and John James (R-Mich.) as well as Bacon, Chavez-DeRemer, D’Esposito, Fitzpatrick, Gonzales, Kean, LaLota, Lawler and Molinaro.\n\nJust one Republican who didn’t back Jordan, for comparison, is a member of the Freedom Caucus: Rep. Ken Buck (Colo.). (Jordan was the Freedom Caucus’s first chairman.)\n\nThe Republican Governance Group describes itself as supporting House Republicans’ “governing wing.” It’s another one of the five families. (The others are the Republican Main Street Caucus, the Republican Study Committee and the Freedom Caucus.)\n\nIts members might not call themselves moderates, but they are more compromise-minded than much of the rest of the conference.\n\nFive of them who aren’t in the Problem Solvers Caucus — Republicans can belong to more than one of the five families — also voted against Jordan on Friday: Reps. Carlos A. Giménez (Fla.), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (Iowa) and Pete Stauber (Minn.) as well as Diaz-Balart and Womack.\n\nTwo-thirds of Republicans in the House at the time objected to certifying that Biden won the 2020 election, but only four of the 25 who refused to back Jordan on Friday did so: Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), Diaz-Balart, Giménez and Rutherford.\n\nA dozen other Jordan opponents — Reps. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) and Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.), as well as Bacon, Buck, Fitzpatrick, Garbarino, Gonzales, Granger, Miller-Meeks, Simpson, Stauber and Womack — voted to certify Biden’s victory. Granger, who had covid at the time, did not vote, while Chavez-DeRemer, Ellzey, James, Kean, Kiggans, LaLota, Lawler and Molinaro weren’t in Congress.\n\nThat’s significant because Jordan refused to say whether Donald Trump won the 2020 election when Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) — who voted to certify the election — asked him about it in House Republicans’ closed-door meeting Monday, Buck told reporters afterward.\n\nJordan’s refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election in the lead-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol played “a big part” in Buck’s deliberations about whether to back him, he said.\n\n“Jim, at some point, if he’s going to lead this conference during a presidential election cycle, and particularly a presidential election year with primaries and caucuses around the country, is going to have to be strong and say, ‘Donald Trump didn’t win the election,’” Buck said Monday.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nFrom left: Barbara Grassley, Nick Davis, Jennifer Heins and Iowa Sen. Charles E. Grassley celebrate a wedding Saturday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Courtesy of Sen. Charles E. Grassley)Alex and Molly Severn held hands near the front of an Iowa church a few years ago, excited for the pastor to pronounce them husband and wife. But for a moment, Molly thought the pastor was going to ruin her wedding. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.“Here, yet again, we have another couple who met through that popular dating site,” the pastor said.Alex and Molly had started dating while they worked at Sen. Charles E. Grassley’s D.C. office in 2016. They did not use a dating website, so Molly was terrified their officiant was about to share false information.But after pausing for a second, the pastor clarified what kind of site he was referring to: “Sen. Grassley’s office.”Since Grassley, an Iowa Republican, was elected to the Senate in 1980, his D.C. and Iowa offices have become matchmaking hot spots. After his chief of staff married a former legislative correspondent on Saturday in Iowa, Grassley said 20 couples who began dating in his office have since married.Grassley, 90, who himself has been married for 69 years, told The Washington Post that he often doesn’t know his employees are dating until they announce their weddings. He can’t pinpoint a reason his office produces so many couples, but he said many of his employees are from Iowa and share similar values and religious beliefs.Plus, his employees spend the bulk of their days working, so they have ample time to be around each other.“When you get married, you’re considered part of the Team Grassley,” he said. “ … You never leave the team.”Grassley said the first married couple from his office met during his 1980 Senate campaign. Since then, he said more have married every few years. A spokesman for Grassley said the senator has turned down some invitations because of scheduling conflicts, but he has attended about five of his employees’ weddings.Grassley, who’s the longest serving Republican senator in U.S. history, proudly said that only one couple from his office has divorced.Grassley’s office isn’t the only one that has produced double-digit marriages. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told Roll Call in 2016 that 13 couples from his office have married.“They work so hard they don’t have a chance to meet anybody,” Schumer told the news outlet.Kathy Nuebel Kovarik and Kurt Kovarik told The Post that they met in Grassley’s D.C. office in the summer of 1998. Kathy, from Le Mars, Iowa, had just joined as an intern, and Kurt, from Decorah, Iowa, was a mail coordinator. They bantered over whether west or east Iowa was the better place to live and blossomed into close friends.In May 1999, Kurt won two tickets to watch David Letterman live in New York. The only people he knew in D.C. were the roughly 20 people he worked with, so he invited Kathy, partly because she owned a car. But the weekend trip turned into a first date. They saw Letterman interview singer Harry Connick Jr. and watched “Rent” on Broadway.At that point, Kathy and Kurt were both legislative correspondents, with adjacent cubicles. They didn’t know the office’s dating policy, so they tried to hide that they were together.But in May 2000, Kathy and Kurt were flying to attend the wedding of one of Kurt’s friends in Iowa. They ran into Grassley at Reagan National Airport, and he was confused why Kathy and Kurt were together, Kurt said.Grassley figured out they were dating, Kurt said, and called his press secretary to share the news.“He was just absolutely tickled that he was the first one to discover it,” Kurt said.Kathy and Kurt continued sitting next to each other when they were promoted to legislative assistants in 2001. The next year, Grassley’s wife, Barbara, approached Kathy’s desk. With Kurt sitting in the adjacent cubicle, Barbara joked with Kathy that she needed to get engaged or leave him, Kurt said. When Kurt proposed later that year, Barbara took credit, Kathy said.The newlyweds took only one day off work the week after their October 2003 wedding in Le Mars, Iowa. They enjoyed working together, but they also grew envious when one had an opportunity to speak with Grassley and the other didn’t.Kathy, now 47, and Kurt, 48, have had three children — 14-year-old and 12-year-old daughters and an 8-year-old son. Their co-workers often heard their discussions about what to have for dinner and who would pick up the kids from school.But that wasn’t unusual — they said there were two other couples in the office. Plus, they said Grassley left tips for long-lasting marriages on their legislative memos.Kathy and Kurt left the office in 2017 and 2018, respectively, for new jobs. By then, even more couples had emerged.Alex Severn, from Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Molly Severn, from Huxley, Iowa, started dating in 2016 while they were staff assistants in Grassley’s D.C. office. They grew close during their free time cheering at Iowa State football watch parties, playing on the office’s softball team and grabbing post-work drinks at Hamilton’s Bar & Grill and Capitol Lounge. Their first date was at Cups and Company in the Russell Senate Office Building’s basement.Alex and Molly didn’t want their colleagues to know they were dating, but they found excuses to see each other. Alex worked at the front desk, and Molly often said she needed to pick up Senate floor passes just to see him. They’re not sure when, but they think Grassley discovered their relationship soon after it began.Alex and Molly left the office in 2017 and 2018, respectively, but that didn’t hinder friendships with their colleagues. They invited almost  all of their co-workers to their wedding in a Huxley church in October 2020, when the pastor joked about Grassley’s office being a dating site.Molly said she and Alex attended another wedding for former colleagues in May 2022. Two more former co-workers, chief of staff Jennifer Heins and former legislative correspondent Nick Davis, began dating after Alex and Molly accepted new jobs in Iowa. Alex, who’s now 30, and Molly, 31, attended their wedding Saturday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where three married couples from Grassley’s office gathered. While Grassley missed the Kovarik and Severn weddings, he attended the latest ceremony.If the office is similar to what she experienced a few years ago, Molly said wedding No. 21 might not be far off.“There’s still an opportunity for young Iowans, or non-Iowans, to be in that office and to also find that sense of community,” Molly said, “and maybe find their future spouse.”‘Connie the Container Dog,’ saved by the Coast Guard, needs a new homeFans root for bald eagles determined to shield eggs from California stormSign in or create a free account to save your preferences",

  "text": "Before dawn on Saturday, Abood Okal and his family received the news they had desperately been waiting for. Okal and his wife and their 1-year-old son were finally offered a possible way out of Gaza — and back to their home near Boston. An email from the U.S. State Department told them the sole border crossing with Egypt “may be open” for a five-hour window later that day, from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Okal and his family went to the Rafah crossing only to find it closed. There were no officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing except for a few plainclothes security guards whose job was to keep people from getting too close to the gate, Okal said.\n\nThe U. S. government had negotiated a deal to allow American citizens to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt during the five-hour window, U.S. officials said Saturday. But Palestinian and Egyptian officials failed to communicate about opening it, an official at the border said. By the end of the day, no one had been able to cross.\n\nWael Abu Omar, the Palestinian spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said Palestinian officials had not had any communication with their counterparts on the Egyptian side. Egyptian media outlets reported that Cairo would only allow foreigners to cross the border if aid shipments could be delivered to Gaza.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has said it would strike any trucks coming across the border, especially trucks carrying fuel, according to a diplomatic official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nOfficials are discussing the possibility of setting up a screening mechanism that would allow the Israelis to inspect goods in each vehicle entering Gaza, the diplomat said. Another official familiar with the talks over the aid deliveries said any agreement would require “Israel to stop bombing the enclave for a few hours.”\n\nThe confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Rafah crossing comes as hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in response to an evacuation order from Israel’s military, ahead of a possible ground invasion into the besieged enclave.\n\n“We have informed U. S. citizens in Gaza with whom we are in contact that if they assess it to be safe, they may wish to move closer to the Rafah border crossing,” the spokesperson said, adding that “there may be very little notice if the crossing opens and it may only open for a limited time.”\n\nU. S. officials have spent the past several days trying to evacuate all U.S. staff in Gaza, a group of about 15 Palestinians that includes three U.S. government employees who work for USAID in Gaza, along with their immediate family members, according to a diplomatic official familiar with the situation.\n\nEach time, they’ve been stopped at checkpoints near the border inside Gaza and have been unable to leave. In some cases at these checkpoints, the diplomatic official said, people identifying themselves as Hamas have said none of them will be able to leave until aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip.\n\nCanadian officials also told citizens on Friday that the Rafah crossing might open Saturday for a five-hour window to allow Canadians to exit. Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters Saturday that the “latest information” she had was that “violence” in the area forced authorities to cancel the operation. She did not elaborate.\n\nOn Friday, Okal and his extended family had rushed south from  Jabalya in the north of Gaza after the Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate. They scrambled frantically to find cars to fit them all and a place to stay near the crossing.\n\nOkal, 36, and his family spent hours waiting under the hot sun Saturday. He said there were several hundred people there, including another American family from New Jersey. He said there were other foreign nationals too, including Canadians, Swedes, Spaniards and Norwegians.\n\nAs the day dragged on, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, took their exhausted toddler, Yousef, back to the home where they are staying with 30 other people, a short drive away. Food vendors near the crossing warned Okal that it was not safe to stay once the sun set. Still, he remained there until nearly 6 p.m., he said, hoping something might change. When he began to hear the sound of fighter planes and drones, he knew he had to leave the area.",

  "text": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.",

  "text": "It’s the second consecutive year Tesla critic Dan O’Dowd has run an ad campaign on television’s biggest night. He leads the Dawn Project, a group that has sought a ban on Tesla’s driver-assistance technology. The latest campaign is unequivocal: “Boycott Tesla,” it says, following footage of deadly and severe crashes involving its vehicles. One ad features footage of Teslas running over child-size mannequins, depictions that have previously led Tesla to issue a cease-and-desist letter.\n\nO’Dowd said he was compelled to bring awareness to the latest issue with what he calls “the most incompetent software I’ve ever seen” in part by The Post’s investigation. O’Dowd founded Green Hills Software, which makes operating systems for cars and airplanes.\n\n“What possible reason is there that they don’t disable Autopilot on roads that they say are not safe?” he asked of Tesla.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, did not respond to a request for comment. Musk’s followers have accused O’Dowd of a conflict of interest because one of Green Hills Software’s customers is Mobileye, which develops driver-assistance software. O’Dowd says his motivation stems purely from concerns over Tesla’s tech.\n\nTesla maintains that its software is intended to be used by a fully attentive driver and argues that it is “morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers,” citing figures it says show a lower prevalence of crashes when its software is activated.\n\n“The people would have it banned if they only knew the truth, if they only understood what it would do,” O’Dowd said. “Well, that’s our job. The politicians aren’t going to move until the public moves.”\n\nThe two ads highlight three significant crashes alleged to have involved Autopilot. In one, a 17-year-old was severely injured when a Tesla struck him at 45 mph as he disembarked a school bus in North Carolina that had its stop sign out and warning lights flashing. “Still Tesla does nothing,” the ad concludes. “Boycott Tesla to keep your kids safe.”\n\nThe ad makes reference to prior Dawn Project videos depicting the alleged failure of Teslas to react to child-size mannequins in the road — including last year’s Super Bowl commercial, which aired weeks before the North Carolina crash.\n\nThe other ad set to air during this year’s game shows the crash that killed a 50-year-old father in 2019 when his Tesla drove under a semi-truck trailer and the moment a Tesla blew through a stop sign and blinking lights on a rural Florida road as it barreled toward a parked vehicle and flung a young couple into the air, killing one of them and leaving the other severely injured — footage first published by The Post. In both cases, Autopilot was operating in locations where it was not intended to be used.\n\n“Tesla dances away from liability in Autopilot crashes by pointing to a note buried deep in the owner’s manual that says Autopilot is only safe on freeways,” the commercial opens, pointing to federal pleas to restrict it.\n\n“Shockingly, Tesla refused,” the commercial continues, leading into footage of the semi-truck crash and the crash involving the young couple. “This caused many tragic accidents when Autopilot was enabled on roads where Tesla knows it isn’t safe. Tesla must be held accountable. Boycott Tesla to keep your family safe.”\n\nThe company is facing concerns over stagnating revenue, mounting worries about its capacity to deliver long-promised “Full Self-Driving” technology, and Wall Street hand-wringing over the persistent distraction of its mercurial CEO. It has shed billions in value, down around 15 percent just in the past month.\n\nMusk has asked for a larger stake in the company as a condition for “growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics,” saying that without 25 percent control he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” But some investors have not given the idea a warm reception. In January, a Delaware judge ruled that an unprecedented $56 billion pay package awarded to him in 2018 was unfair.",

  "text": "An earlier version of the above caption incorrectly said that President Abraham Lincoln was visiting Antietam, Md. He was at the Antietam battlefield in Maryland. The caption has been corrected. President Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday as the Israeli military ramps up its response to the Hamas attack. It will be Biden’s second visit as president to an active war zone not under U.S. military control; he visited Ukraine in February.As commander in chief of the U.S. military, presidents have always had a role to fill in wartime. And many, from the first president, have had military experience. But only a handful have made trips to active war zones while in office. Here are some historical highlights.\n\nWhile Abraham Lincoln is sometimes described as the first president to come under enemy fire in an active war zone, it was actually James Madison during the War of 1812, according to Michael Beschloss, author of “Presidents of War.” On Aug. 24, 1814, Madison traveled from the White House to the Battle of Bladensburg a few miles east, brandishing two pistols and a spyglass. Though it is extremely unlikely the British knew Madison was there, he nonetheless came under enemy fire.\n\nOnce it was clear that the British were going to win the battle and invade the capital, Madison high-tailed it back through Washington and over the Potomac River to Virginia. The British set the Capitol and the White House on fire, but their sacking of the city was interrupted by a sudden hurricane-strength storm, prompting a hasty retreat. Madison returned to Washington a week later, on Sept. 1.\n\nLincoln made numerous battlefield visits during the Civil War, though the only time he ventured close enough to come under enemy fire was during his visit to Fort Stevens, on the northern side of the District of Columbia, on July 12, 1864. The tall, lanky, top-hatted president cut a recognizable profile from a distance, and Confederate soldiers soon began shooting at him, prompting a Union soldier to request that Lincoln kindly leave; he is often said, apocryphally, to have shouted, “Get down, you damn fool!”\n\nFort Stevens Park, where the fort once stood, is in D. C.’s Brightwood neighborhood, and there’s a small cemetery a few blocks away for Union soldiers killed in the Battle of Fort Stevens.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt became the first president to fly on an airplane during his secret 1943 trip to North Africa as World War II raged. While the media thought he was vacationing at his home in New York’s Hudson Valley, Roosevelt traveled by train to Miami, where he took a plane to Trinidad and Tobago, then to Brazil and Gambia before finally landing in Casablanca, Morocco, five days later. There, he attended strategy meetings with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and French commander Charles de Gaulle, before surprising U. S. military members with a drive-by review. A United Press International correspondent later wrote that as the president’s Jeep slowly passed by, the surprise at his presence left soldiers’ “faces wreathed in smiles.”\n\nIn October 1966, as American support for the war in Vietnam began to wane, Lyndon B. Johnson made a surprise visit to U. S. forces at Cam Ranh Bay. Like Lincoln, Johnson was a tall guy and made himself a pretty easy target by getting close to the action, according to Beschloss, even standing up in a Jeep to address the troops. Unlike Lincoln, he did not come under fire. Johnson made a second visit to Cam Ranh Bay the next year.\n\nEvery president since Johnson has visited U. S. troops posted in conflict zones overseas. Richard M. Nixon also went to Vietnam; Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump all visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea; both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush served Thanksgiving turkeys to troops in Iraq during their presidencies; Bill Clinton visited Bosnia; and Barack Obama spent time with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nVisits to U. S. troops overseas are nothing new for Biden, who went on such trips as vice president and as a senator on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhat is new is that the U. S. military is not actively engaged in the conflict zones Biden is visiting this year. His February visit to Ukraine and now his visit to Israel are both without precedent in modern presidential history.",

  "text": "A State Department official who worked on arms transfers to foreign powers resigned Wednesday over the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, declaring he could not support further U. S. military assistance to Israel and calling the administration’s response “an impulsive reaction” based on “intellectual bankruptcy.”Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.The official, Josh Paul, was director of congressional and public affairs at the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which handles arms transfers. His departure marks a rare measure of internal discomfort over the administration’s robust support for Israel, the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East. More broadly, it was an unusual public show of dissent within President Biden’s foreign policy apparatus, which has worked to prevent such expressions of frustration from spilling over into view.\n\nPaul had spent more than 11 years in his role, which coordinates relations with Congress and public messaging for a key office that deals with military aid. He said that he could not countenance continuing in a job that he said was contributing to the deaths of Palestinian civilians.\n\n“Let’s absolutely note the horror of what Hamas did, and the scale of it. And therefore I fear the scale of the potential Israeli response or ongoing Israeli response,” Paul said in an interview. “I recognize the Israeli government’s right to respond and to defend themselves. I guess I question how many Palestinian children have to die in that process.”\n\nPaul said the robust U. S. military assistance for Israel was effectively giving the country a green light to do what it wants against Gaza, regardless of the civilian toll. The Israeli government has declared that it plans to destroy Hamas and has told the residents of Gaza City and northern Gaza to move southward, a request U.N. observers have declared will create a humanitarian disaster.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has spent the past week hopscotching the Middle East in a bid to create regional support for Israel’s right to defend itself and avoid a regional war, but also to push Israel to respect humanitarian concerns in Gaza.\n\nBiden, visiting Israel on Wednesday, declared that the United States is “going to stand with you.” But he urged Israelis to draw a distinction between Palestinians and Hamas, and to minimize civilian casualties.\n\nPaul said that he had encountered other dilemmas while working on military assistance inside the State Department, but that he had always felt he could “bend things in the right direction.” Not so this time, which was the biggest reason he resigned, he said.\n\n“There’s no questioning on this one. There’s no space for substantive dissent within the system on this one. And that’s what led me to my decision,” he said. He said there wasn’t a single precipitating moment that led to his resignation Wednesday, simply the feeling of being party to a slew of decisions that he disagreed with and felt powerless to influence.\n\nAlthough State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs also has had a major role in arms transfers to Ukraine after Russia invaded last year, Paul’s academic background and career has long intertwined with Israel and the Palestinian territories. He wrote his master’s thesis about Israeli counterterrorism and civil rights, he said, and worked in Ramallah, in the West Bank, on security sector governance with the Palestinian Authority. And, in his resignation letter, he said he had “deep personal ties to both sides of the conflict.”\n\nPaul said he spent last week on a preplanned leave, giving him more space to watch what was happening from the outside and to contemplate his decision. Since he publicly announced his resignation in a two-page declaration posted on LinkedIn, he said he had received many expressions of support from State Department colleagues.",

  "text": "“The United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during the conflict. And I grieve. I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy,” Biden said. Earlier in the day, the president said his assessment of responsibility was based on data shown to him by the U. S. Defense Department.\n\nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the U. S. government assessment was based on “available reporting, including intelligence, missile activity, overhead imagery, and open source video and images of the incident.” The intelligence, she said, indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion was caused by a rocket or missile launched by a militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. She said U.S. officials are working to corroborate whether that is the case.\n\nSince the hospital was devastated Tuesday by a strike that Palestinian authorities said killed hundreds of people, Israel and the United States have been the targets of rage, condemnation and protest that have surged across the Middle East. Wednesday’s statements by Israel and the United States that a Palestinian militant group was responsible for the blast may carry little weight with Arab protesters.\n\nAmong the most useful pieces of information in identifying who may be responsible for a strike are infrared signatures from satellites, which may have detected a rocket launch as opposed to an aerial bombing, one U. S. official said. Images of the impact site, as well as any fragments recovered, could also help identify who was responsible, the official said.\n\nThe U. S. conclusion appeared to do little to assuage anger in Arab and Muslim countries, where people generally harbor deep distrust of Israel and the United States. Israel’s army in the past has blamed Palestinian militants for strikes and civilian deaths and then later acknowledged it was probably at fault, such as in the death of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.\n\nIn Amman, Jordan, Biden had been scheduled to meet with the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to discuss the conflict and the need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. The White House said Biden would continue to be in touch with those leaders, but the meeting’s cancellation was a setback to the president’s diplomatic efforts.\n\n“For the people of Israel, there’s only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel, and that is having you standing in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war, and it is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel.”",

  "text": "Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday’s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.\n\nPalestinian teams combed Wednesday through the blast zone — an area that radiated from a crater punched into pavement just outside the four-story complex. Cars were flipped over by the force of the explosion. Other vehicles were charred. The blast bent metal fencing and shattered windows.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said 471 people were killed and more than 300 were injured, with 28 of the injured in critical condition. The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“Because of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,” said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.\n\nIt’s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel’s military said that part of a “barrage of rockets” fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden’s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.\n\n“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.\n\nHundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.\n\nVideo verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion — a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.\n\nHospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.\n\nMore than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died — many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion — and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.\n\nRegional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan’s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war “has entered a dangerous phase,” and “will plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,” according to a palace statement.\n\nBiden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack.",

  "text": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.",

  "text": "Over the same period, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 60 Palestinians in the West Bank and injured more than 1,300, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has also locked down parts of the West Bank, closing roads and putting up checkpoints to prevent Palestinians from moving between towns and cities.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in 1967. Under the Oslo accords, brokered by President Bill Clinton in 1993, those territories were meant to form a Palestinian state. But the U. S.-led peace process has been dormant for years. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded. Members of Israel’s current government, the most far-right in its history, have called openly for annexation.\n\nSince 2007, when Hamas violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip, Abbas has cracked down on supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza, as well as on his own critics. Long-promised elections have never been held. Despair has deepened in the impoverished refugee camps that still dot the West Bank.\n\nOver the past two years, camps in Nablus, Jenin and elsewhere have become incubators for a new generation of armed groups that have carried out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians. Israel has responded with massive military raids across the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians here since the end of the second intifada in 2005.\n\n“The worst is yet to come,” said the 38-year-old militant, a father of three, speaking on the condition that he be identified by his childhood nickname to protect his security. Zoufi said he awoke on Oct. 7 to the news of Hamas’s rampage and asked his wife to slap him to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. Then he laughed with joy.\n\nZoufi is affiliated with Fatah but opposes the Palestinian Authority’s nonviolent approach. He founded his militant cell last year. Balata is home to some 30,000 people and has no proper police force. The same is true in other camps in Nablus and Jenin and throughout the northern West Bank. In these communities, the militants are the ones in charge.\n\n“If Israel will do a stupid thing like the ground invasion, war will break out not only in the West Bank and inside Israel but also around the Arab world,” he said. “We want liberation, not bloodshed. ... I hope it will stop before it comes to that.”\n\nMohamed Hamdan, the secretary general of Fatah in Nablus, defended Abbas and his efforts to revive peace negotiations. He said the authority was doing its best to maintain order and rein in weapons on the street. But the international community had “betrayed” the Palestinians, he said.",

  "text": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.",

  "text": "BEIRUT — Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel’s denial of responsibility, or Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”\n\nAn accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.",

  "text": "For Abood Okal and his family, the nights are the worst — and each night is worse than the last. When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.\n\nOkal and his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son Yousef left their home outside Boston last month for a long-planned reunion with their parents. They were supposed to fly home on Friday. Now they don’t know when they’ll be able to get back to the United States.\n\nOkal’s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday’s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.\n\nAs Okal spoke over the phone from the home of his wife’s parents in the wee hours of Friday, there were at least eight audible explosions, with others in the distance.\n\nSleep is elusive. The bombs shake them awake, Okal said, and they find themselves coughing in air heavy with dust from pulverized buildings. He and his wife get up early, taking turns caring for their toddler and trying their best to pretend, for his sake, that everything will be all right.\n\nThe electricity is gone. The family is relying on a few solar panels, some batteries and power banks to recharge their phones and turn on a television for news. Their supply of milk and diapers is dwindling.\n\nThe market across the street has no bottled water left. Soon they will have to choose whether to risk going farther away in search of it, exposing themselves to more potential danger, or start drinking the water from a tank usually only used for washing or bathing.\n\nOkal works at pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb and lives in Medway, a small town southwest of Boston. He went to college in New Jersey and did graduate studies in Utah, where he developed a taste for snowboarding.\n\nOnce, when he was hiking in Zion National Park, he and a group of friends were trapped by a flash flood. After many hours, they managed to get out, but park rangers told them they were lucky to survive. Now that sense of visceral fear is with him almost all the time.\n\n“This is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,” he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. “I’ve never seen things on this scale,” Okal said.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have tried to get on a list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but they’re not sure if it’s functioning or if they would be turned back. When Okal’s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far — even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.\n\nIf his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws.",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

Here’s what it was like. This $3,499 headset is rough around the edges, but it made me optimistic about ‘spatial’ computingChris Velazco uses an Apple Vision Pro. (Carolyn Fong for The Washington Post) SAN FRANCISCO — I’ve fallen asleep watching movies on a Vision Pro, the $3,499 face computer Apple released earlier this month.I watched virtual planes land in Atlanta while listening to air traffic control, then edited a spreadsheet of addresses for wedding invites. I examined a roast through the headset’s cameras, and ate it without stabbing myself.Take it from me: Life inside this headset is equal parts mesmerizing and messy.When you get into the groove, using the Vision Pro can feel thrilling. But when things don’t work the way you expect — which in my case was pretty often — you may wonder why you didn’t just use the gadgets you already have.To see what “spatial computing” could really do for me, I wore the Vision Pro every day for two weeks. Here’s what you should know.Here's what you can and can't do Apple's new VisionProWhat it’s like to wear the headset for hoursComfort: I could wear the 1.3-pound Vision Pro for four or five hours before my neck needed a break, but I had to adjust the fit often. (And yes, taking it off is always a relief.) I never felt nauseous, and a colleague prone to motion sickness found the experience surprisingly bearable — but she still started feeling uneasy after 45 minutes.Navigation: When you open an app, it just floats wherever you stick it in the world around you, even if you walk away. Bring an app close to you, and you can interact with it the way you would on an iPad.But you’ll also have to get used to navigating with your eyes. For apps you’re not right next to, you can look right at them and put your thumb and index finger together to select something. I’ve watched total novices figure it out instantly — but there’s still a learning curve.Surrounding yourself with app windows can be helpful, but some may find it overwhelming. (Video: Chris Velazco/The Washington Post)Frequently, I’ve looked at some something I wanted to select and pinched my fingers, only for nothing to happen. I’ve “clicked” on the wrong thing because elements of an app or webpage were too close together. I’ve even flicked app windows someplace else completely, because I didn’t realize my fingers were touching before I moved my hand.“Spatial” computing: If the Vision Pro has one purpose, it’s to let you put the content and apps you want to use where you need them. You can have 9 or 10 apps running before the headset starts to struggle, and I’ve spent days trying apps in different places to see what feels useful. Surprisingly, those floating apps were most helpful when dealing with daily drudgery.I hand-wash dishes a lot, and it’s supremely tedious. But it’s less so when I have a YouTube video floating above my sink, one that I can interact with without drenching my phone or touching my ear buds.The Vision Pro's live video feed of the world around you is fast enough to cook with. (Video: Chris Velazco/The Washington Post)I also always forget about clothes in the dryer. Now, when, I do a load of laundry, I can hang a virtual timer in my hallway as a visual reminder.And on short afternoon workouts, I kept Slack and my email floating off to my side while (slowly) riding a stationary bike. By spinning a small dial (the “Digital Crown”), I could replace my apartment with a craggy Hawaiian landscape, complete with the sound of a lonely wind. I didn’t even need to reach for another device when someone needed me; I just pulled the app window over with a pinch and went to work.Silly? Maybe — but now that I’ve tried these things, I really want to keep doing them.In theory, the Vision Pro can be a portable, private office — just strap in, arrange your work apps, and get to it.I tried this for a few hours each day, and it’s definitely doable. It helps to pair a Bluetooth keyboard and one of Apple’s trackpads to the headset, since using the built-in virtual keyboard is a chore.But to get work done fast, I had to lean on the headset’s Virtual Desktop mode, which connects to a nearby Mac and turns its screen into a virtual window you can resize and stick where you like. When I’m editing my photos or tediously formatting all those wedding invite addresses, a big-screen version of my computer surrounded by vast, virtual environments is tough to beat.On Feb. 2, Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset went on sale. Help Desk reporter Chris Velazco tried the thing to see if it's worth the hype and the money. (Video: Monica Rodman/The Washington Post)But even this comes with quirks. If you have an Apple laptop,  you just have to look at it — a “Connect” button will appear over the computer. But if you use something like a Mac Mini, or a closed MacBook hooked up to a monitor, the Vision Pro may struggle to find it. (As I sat down to write this article, it took three tries to get the Virtual Desktop working.)The headset’s super-sharp screens also mean it’s wonderful for just watching things. I missed “Oppenheimer” in Imax earlier this year, but cuing it up on a virtual screen as big as my living room wasn’t a bad alternative. And the sound coming from a set of lump-like speakers was so good that I mostly left my ear buds behind.You’ll also want to keep the Vision Pro’s battery pack plugged in during longer movies; I generally got between two and three hours of use from a single charge.These are, arguably, what the Vision Pro is best at right now. The Vision Pro’s App Store could change that in time; for now it’s a funky a blend of the practical (like Microsoft’s Office apps), the gimmicky (like “Day,” which lets you spin VR turntables), and the odd-yet-earnest (like “Xaia,” an immersive AI therapy tool.)Apple’s new Vision Pro is a privacy mess waiting to happenPeople treat you a little differently when you’re wearing a Vision Pro.Sure, you can see them almost normally through the headset’s cameras. I say “almost” because you’ll see that video feed blur a little while moving your head. (Be careful walking over to them, too, since the headset blocks your peripheral vision.)But assuming you’re looking right at someone, they may be peering back at a set of hazy digital eyes on the headset’s outer screen. Those “eyes” are powered by the Vision Pro’s still-in-beta “Personas,” your virtual stand-for FaceTime video calls or Zoom meetings.My traveling fiancée was happy to cut our nightly FaceTime calls short after seeing it.I was nearly ready to write my Persona off until a friend with a Vision Pro FaceTimed me to catch up. The first half-hour of looking at his faux-face was unnerving. But as the conversation stretched into an hour, and then another, the weirdness had evaporated — it just felt like I was looking at my friend, not some weird facsimile. And he felt the same way.You can, and probably will, get used to these things. The real question is how fast, and who may avoid you until they get used to it, too.Unfortunately, the Vision Pro also has a sharing problem.A Guest User mode lets your friends see what the fuss is about, but two out of three people I’ve tried it with struggled to get through the setup process. (One person put the headset on four times before it even recognized it wasn’t looking at me.)And no support for multiple users means communal use at home isn’t possible the way it is with a Mac or iPad.Thankfully, there’s at least one way the Vision Pro can make you feel more connected to others: You can use it to view immersive  videos captured with an iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max, or another Vision Pro. (Don’t worry: You can watch them as normal 2D videos on an iPhone.) They don’t always feel lifelike, but when scenes were captured just right, I felt present — and a little less alone — in moments and with people who weren’t really there.You probably know you don’t need this right now. It’s bulky, expensive and very much a first-generation product. But it’s also a glimpse at a new way of living with technology; one I think a lot of people could find helpful if they get past some inherent weirdness.You might want to try it by scheduling a demo at an Apple Store. Better to lose 25 minutes than thousands of dollars.After these two weeks, I’m sold on what the Vision Pro can do. I want to keep app windows around me in just the right places, shut out the world sometimes when I need some alone time, and pop back in when I’m ready. I just don’t want to wear a hefty headset on my face to be able to do these things, or shell out at least $3,499 for it.Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

  "text": "Hamas militants have vowed to broadcast their executions of Israeli hostages on the internet. Recent history shows there’s virtually nothing tech companies can do to prevent that from happening. Israeli strikes have pummeled Gaza. Now a land invasion is imminent.Live-streamed murders in Buffalo and Christchurch, New Zealand, remain visible on the web and have been viewed millions of times, long after the mass killings took place. Companies’ efforts to stop access to violent videos have been stymied by an open internet that makes it easy to watch, save and share videos at viral speed — and by the changing strategies of killers and propagandists, who can use a network of distributed online services to ensure the videos remain forever within reach.\n\nA spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in an audio message posted to the group’s Telegram account this week that its fighters would kill hostages, one by one, every time an Israeli strike hits a home in Gaza, the dense coastal strip of more than 2 million Palestinians under Hamas control.\n\nThe executions, the spokesman said, would be broadcast in “audio and video,” though he did not specify where or when they would be shown. Hamas is believed to have abducted more than 100 people, mostly civilians, during its brutal assault on southern Israel. Some have already been killed, according to video reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nThe threat harks back to videos nearly a decade ago from the Islamic State, which spread fear and won attention by posting videos showing the beheadings of journalists, aid workers and other civilian captives. But those videos were prerecorded and edited. Hamas’s pledge to record and air executions that have yet to take place is new and seems calibrated to incite fear over the barbarism to come.\n\n“Hamas’s entire strategy is to inflict as much damage as possible and drive as much attention to that damage as possible, in order to incite fear for the broader public,” said Graham Brookie, a senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “This is one of the first times we’ve seen this glossy propaganda content recorded in real time.”\n\nMany of the videos feature relatively sophisticated touches, such as opening title animations and action-movie-style soundtracks, suggesting the group has a predesigned workflow for recording, editing and publication. Some of the videos appeared in edited form online within hours after the ambush began.\n\n“Hamas has been very well prepared for this and has created professional systems to get their message out,” said Josh Lipowsky, a senior research analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group in Washington that tracks online extremism.\n\nSome researchers said they expect Hamas would publish any execution videos to Telegram, from which they are likely to be reposted to mainstream sites such as X, formerly known as Twitter, where they might gain millions of views.\n\nBut the group could also live-stream the executions to a social media platform or other website using a throwaway account, as mass killers have done in recent years. Those videos could then be saved and republished across a number of other video services, practically guaranteeing that the clips would never disappear from the web.\n\n“You cannot rule out a Christchurch-style broadcast,” Brookie said, referring to the 2019 killings of 49 people inside two New Zealand mosques that were live-streamed on Facebook. “There are very few ways to stop that. It may reach only a few people in the moment, but it has the potential to go viral.”\n\nTelegram, which did not respond to requests for comment, has largely tolerated violent content on its platform on the basis of promoting unrestrained free expression. Other lesser-known sites specialize in the sharing of extreme videos and do not respond to requests for removal.\n\nFacebook and other mainstream social networks pay for internal content-moderation systems and staffs to look for and block violent content. After the New Zealand shootings, 14 internet services and 55 international governments backed a policy argument, known as the Christchurch Call, designed to combat the sharing of extremist content. (Telegram is not among them.)\n\nBut the pact does not proactively monitor each live stream or shared video, and violent individuals have found ways to circumvent the rules. Last year, when a racist gunman live-streamed himself killing 10 people in a Buffalo grocery store, the video was streamed to Twitch, where it was removed within two minutes of the first gunshots — enough time for at least one viewer to repost it on other sites, including Facebook, where it was viewed millions of times.\n\nThe brutality showcased in Hamas’s videos has proved especially graphic, even compared to videos from other conflict zones around the world, due partly to the group’s preplanning and technological capabilities, Brookie said. In some of the videos, militants can be seen wearing GoPro cameras, so as to record the video from a more visceral, first-person perspective.\n\nSuch footage has become a more common facet of modern combat. Ukraine has used first-person video from soldiers’ helmets and attack drones to document its war against Russian invaders. And the use of GoPro cameras on the battlefield was first popularized by Syria’s volunteer Civil Defense force, known as the White Helmets, which have used them to record their rescues of civilians since Russia dispatched troops there in 2015.",

  "text": "After his Capitals lost at the Florida Panthers on Thursday despite playing a strong first period and taking a pair of leads, Coach Spencer Carbery challenged them to string together more than one good period. During their skid, the Capitals found ways to play well for 20 minutes at a time — whether it was a dominant first period at Colorado on Jan. 24 in a 6-2 loss or a resurgent second period during a 5-2 defeat to Montreal on Tuesday that failed to spark a comeback — but that appeared to be all Washington could sustain.\n\n“We’ve just got to find a way to dig in and just get another level to be able to sustain it,” Carbery said Thursday. “The first period — can you make it two? And then can you make it three?”\n\n“Our most complete game of the year — hands down, start to finish,” Carbery said. “All the different areas that we needed to be dialed in in, we were. Pace was there. Competitiveness. … We were so connected with everything that we did in all three zones. It was impressive from our group today.”\n\nIn the first period, Washington outshot the Bruins 15-4 and generated six high-danger scoring chances, per Natural Stat Trick. But the Capitals could not solve Jeremy Swayman (25 saves for the game), and an inability to capitalize on early scoring chances has been their undoing for much of the season.\n\nLate in the opening period, seemingly in retaliation for a hit along the end boards, Boston defenseman Matt Grzelcyk speared winger Max Pacioretty, earning a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct to put the Capitals on an extended power play. They couldn’t convert before the period ended, but at 1:05 of the second, Pacioretty — who went down the tunnel after the incident but returned after intermission — found T. J. Oshie in the slot to put Washington ahead. Oshie benefited from a shot by captain Alex Ovechkin that broke Bruins defenseman Brandon Carlo’s stick, giving him more space to operate.\n\nThe Capitals didn’t score again that period, but they remained in control of the run of play. After 40 minutes, the Bruins had just eight shots on goal. Washington had 23, matching its full-game total from Thursday’s loss.\n\nIn some games when the Capitals had the lead, they appeared unprepared to handle a push by the opponent in the third period. But Saturday, Washington largely remained in control, even though it had to kill three penalties in the final 20 minutes.\n\n“We just had a solid game all around,” center Dylan Strome said. “We didn’t give them much through two periods at all. Chuckie was good when he needed to be. … It felt like tonight at least, they didn’t really have one shift that they kind of hemmed us in. That was a big thing.”\n\nEarly in the third period, Lindgren stuck out his left pad to stop a tipped shot by the Bruins’ Charlie Coyle through traffic; Lindgren could barely see the puck coming, but he made the save to keep the Capitals in front. And just seconds later, Strome curled a wrist shot under the crossbar off a feed from Ovechkin on a two-on-one at 3:24 to give Washington some breathing room. It was the first time the Capitals led by multiple goals since they beat St. Louis, 5-2, on Jan. 18 — the last victory before the six-game skid.\n\n“I saw a guy kind of flashing in front of me. I don’t know if it hit off his stick or his knee or whatever it was — more of a positional save there,” Lindgren said. “[Ovechkin] made a really good pass to Stromer, and he finished it off. That was a big goal at a big time.”\n\nPacioretty, defenseman John Carlson and Ovechkin found their way to the penalty box in the final 11:30. Ovechkin’s minor for hooking came with just 2:56 to play, and that prompted the Bruins to pull Swayman for a six-on-four advantage — but they still couldn’t break through.\n\nBoston’s goal remained vacant after the penalty ended, and Ovechkin hit the empty net to extend his goal streak to four games, become the NHL’s all-time leader in empty-net goals (57) and seal a victory the Capitals desperately needed, much to the relief of the players and their mentors.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Washington will host the Vancouver Canucks (34-12-6), who came into Saturday tied with the Bruins atop the NHL. The Capitals know how tough the challenge ahead is, but after winning for the first time in more than three weeks, it may be just a little less daunting.\n\n“I’ll just tell you what: As a goalie, it was so much fun to watch the guys in front of me work tonight,” Lindgren said. “This win tonight, this shutout, all the credit in the world goes to the guys in front of me. I thought the effort, right from the drop of the puck, start to finish, was incredible.",

  "text": "All Tyrese Maxey needed Saturday night against the Washington Wizards was a little time to get going. Entering the fourth quarter, his Philadelphia 76ers teammates had afforded him that luxury, providing a narrow lead after his two-point third quarter. They also had given him space to operate.The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news.And there, with less than two minutes left and Maxey stalking on the right wing, the Wizards provided a lane. An absence of on-ball pressure and late help-side defense let Maxey weave forward, then back, then forward again as he zipped to the hoop. With his final basket in a 15-point fourth quarter — a driving layup for an eight-point lead on a night when it seemed every point of his came with his body splayed out stomach-down on the Capital One Arena court — he put Washington away.\n\nOn a night when Washington’s defense flopped, then fluttered, the Wizards — stop us if you’ve heard this before — faltered in the closing minutes against the 76ers’ Maxey and Ricky Council IV as they fell, 119-113, for their sixth straight loss.\n\n“They were driving by us, and it built their confidence. And by the time we kind of snapped into gear and changed our attitude, it was a little too late,” the Wizards’ Corey Kispert said.\n\nEach team had lost eight of its previous 10 games and was on the second game of a back-to-back, but the 76ers (31-21) looked plenty spry as zippy drives to the basket by Maxey and Kelly Oubre Jr. built a double-digit lead early in the second quarter. Washington (9-43) chipped away, pulling within three at halftime as Tyus Jones’s fifth first-half three-pointer capped an 8-0 run in the final 72 seconds of the quarter.\n\nThe close score in part was a byproduct of circumstance; reigning MVP Joel Embiid has been out of Philadelphia’s lineup since Jan. 30 with a lateral meniscus injury in his left knee. He bludgeoned the Wizards for 34, 48 and 50 points earlier this season.\n\nThe Wizards kept within reasonable distance early in the second half, bouncing back from the wrong side of a 13-3 run midway through the third quarter with a 14-5 run in the fourth that cut their deficit to two.\n\nJones led Washington with 25 points and nine assists. Deni Avdija and Kyle Kuzma (21 points each) also contributed for the Wizards. Still, Washington again failed to meet interim coach Brian Keefe’s call for improved defense. He also said he’ll be more likely to play a traditional big if the Wizards struggle with defensive rebounding late in the game, but he stuck with Kuzma and Avdija in the frontcourt because they were chiefly responsible for the late push.\n\nWashington remains the only team in the NBA without a win on the second night of a back-to-back this season (0-9). The loss also clinched the franchise’s worst pre-all-star-break record since it moved to Washington in 1973.\n\nIf Richaun Holmes was at all apprehensive about his new situation, the way a player might be when asked to uproot his life, he did a fantastic job concealing it in the hour before Washington’s loss.\n\nThe Wizards’ newest addition — who didn’t play Saturday but joined the team for the first time after being acquired Thursday with a first-round draft pick from the Dallas Mavericks for Daniel Gafford — was all smiles as he paced around the arena. He laughed and joked with a staffer on his walk to the locker room, fist-bumping just about every coach and security guard in his vicinity along the way.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, he reclined in a folding chair at his new locker, relaxed as all get out. Without deviating from a broad smile, he talked about opportunity — the chance to do the dirty work for the Wizards and provide physicality on the interior and to reunite with Marvin Bagley III after their time together in Sacramento — and said before the trade Washington was one of his favorite cities to visit and featured a roster that impressed him offensively.\n\n“I mean, I think that’s what they want from me,” the 30-year-old said. “I’m not used to being one of the oldest guys in the locker room, but that’s something I want to bring and something I want to do.”",

  "text": "On Google’s YouTube and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, you can stand with Israel, call for peace or lament the plight of Palestinians. But expressions of support for Hamas are forbidden. Both companies consider Hamas an extremist organization, meaning that no one affiliated with the group is allowed to use their platforms, and no videos or images created by Hamas can be posted there.\n\nIn contrast, the influential messaging platform Telegram does very little content moderation. It hosts a Hamas channel that has been openly broadcasting grisly footage and images of dead Israelis to more than 100,000 subscribers. And some of those posts have been rebroadcast on Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, which nominally prohibits Hamas content but appears to be doing relatively little to police it after Musk laid off the majority of the company’s employees.\n\nExperts say X in particular has become a hub for posts and videos taken down by other platforms for violating their rules against graphic violence or hate speech. On Tuesday, European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton posted a letter to Musk warning him that regulators have “indications” that the site may be in violation of European rules on violent and terrorist content, as well as disinformation.\n\nIn the case of the Israel-Gaza war, those calls are complicated by a desire to avoid being seen as abetting a terrorist organization by enabling it to broadcast propaganda, threats, hostage videos or even executions. Facebook has been sued in the past by the families of people killed by Hamas. And earlier this year, Google, Twitter and Meta defended themselves at the Supreme Court against charges that they had materially aided the Islamic State terrorist group  by hosting or recommending its content, such as recruiting videos. (In each of those cases, the tech firms prevailed.)\n\nBut defining what counts as an extremist group isn’t always straightforward, and social media platforms over the years have faced scrutiny over which government actors, political movements, military operations and violent regimes get a voice and which don’t. After the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan in 2021, social media companies had to make a high-stakes decision about whether to continue to ban the Taliban, since it had taken over the country’s government.\n\n“Within social media companies, the category that you’re placed in determines how your speech is going to be treated,” said Anika Collier Navaroli, senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and a former senior Twitter policy official. “The speech of a political party is going to be treated extremely different than the speech that comes from a terrorist. The speech from a legitimate nation-state is also going to be treated different than somebody who is not recognized as that.”\n\nOn TikTok, both the #Israel and #Palestine hashtags have attracted tens of billions of views as young people turn to the platform for news and perspectives on the conflict. But at least one prominent account that covers news from a Palestinian perspective received a notice Monday that it had been permanently banned. TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said Tuesday that the ban was a mistake and that the account, Mondoweiss, was reinstated.\n\nSince Hamas’s incursion began, TikTok has shifted more content moderators to focus on posts about the conflict, including posts in Arabic and Hebrew, Favazza said. It has also been blocking some hashtags associated with graphic violence or terrorist propaganda, including footage of hostages or executions. And it is working with fact-checkers to identify misinformation, though a quick browse through popular searches such as “Israel” and “Gaza” on Tuesday turned up numerous videos from previous, unrelated conflicts that were being presented as though they were new. Other videos racked up views with graphic footage of Israeli victims, likely produced originally by Hamas, with a thin veneer of commentary decrying the acts.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement that the company had established “a special operations center” with experts who are fluent in Hebrew and Arabic to closely monitor the situation. “Our teams are working around the clock to keep our platforms safe, take action on content that violates our policies or local law, and coordinate with third-party fact checkers in the region to limit the spread of misinformation,” Stone said.\n\nOn Telegram, an apparently official Hamas account with close to 120,000 subscribers has routinely posted grisly video of the attacks on Israel. One clip, with more than 77,000 views, showed an unidentified militant stomping on a dead soldier’s face. Many of the videos have been reposted to X. At least one of the videos was also posted by the media outlet Al Jazeera Arabic to YouTube, where it has nearly 13 million subscribers, but with some of the gore blurred.",

  "text": "The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re’im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.\n\nAt least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.\n\nThe attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. “The event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,” ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.\n\nThe festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.\n\nBen Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. “I took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,” she said. “The people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.”\n\nThey drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.\n\nOn Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.\n\nArgamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. “If she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn’t have gone, but we knew nothing,” Marciano said. “She wasn’t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, ‘Go; you’re young.’ I regret that.”\n\nIn the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, “Allahu akbar!” A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair.",

  "text": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet when the country’s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington’s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nEgypt also believed a deal had been reached with the United States and Israel to open the crossing for almost five hours on Monday, to allow 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza and foreign passport holders to leave the strip, according to a person with knowledge of Egyptian diplomatic efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n“If we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,” said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. “It fell in the sand,” he said. “If it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.”\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration’s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East — essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation’s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIsraeli officials said Monday that  the military was holding a number of gunmen that it captured during the attack. The Israel Defense Forces was also reviewing body-camera footage taken from some of the prisoners, as well as from slain Hamas fighters, giving the army more insight into their movements, planning and communications, Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza.",

  "text": "BEIRUT — Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel’s denial of responsibility, or Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”\n\nAn accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.",

  "text": "That emphasis represented a shift for the Biden administration, which has given blanket support to Israel’s military operations in advance of a ground invasion that human rights groups say will result in large-scale civilian casualties. But there was little sign Sunday of any substantive steps toward easing the situation in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israeli soldiers were “ready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.”\n\nAs Secretary of State Antony Blinken touched down in Egypt on Sunday, relief supplies sat at an airport in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, less than an hour’s drive from the border with Gaza. Some of the aid supplies — delivered by regional countries such as Turkey, as well as the United Nations — have been stranded on Egypt’s side of the border for days.\n\nDiplomats and others familiar with the discussions said one of the main obstacles to the delivery of that aid is the Israeli government’s refusal to guarantee that it will not bomb relief trucks. One diplomatic official said negotiations were underway to allow Israel to inspect trucks entering Gaza.\n\n“We are calling on all parties to open the humanitarian corridor — to have a humanitarian pause in the conflict and to open the border, to allow supplies to go into children who need them right now,” Jeremy Hopkins, Egypt representative for UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nTouma said her agency had not been able to confirm that water, or some water, had been restored. Gaza receives water through a variety of sources, aside from the public water network, including from private vendors. Desalination plants and pumping stations require fuel, which Israel was still blocking.\n\nOther diplomats were less optimistic than the Biden administration that progress was being made on the humanitarian front. “Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies” even as aid stockpiled in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel itself could be “dispatched with hours,” U. N. Secretary General António Guterres said in a late afternoon statement. “We are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,” he said, and neither the hostages being held by Hamas nor humanitarian aid to Gaza “should become bargaining chips.”\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 2,600 people. Israel also warned more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, an order human rights groups have called impossible.\n\nBiden also said in the interview that Hamas needs to be eliminated entirely but that there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. But the president said he did not think Israel would pursue that path right now.\n\nIt said it shut access to an “area up to four kilometers from the northern border with Lebanon” on Sunday morning in response to an “incident” in northern Israel. It asked residents not to enter or approach the area and warned that GPS signals would be restricted.",

  "text": "Keren Shem got her first glimpse of her missing child when everyone else did. She saw her daughter, Mia Shem, in a hostage video Monday — the first time Hamas had publicly released a clip of one of the roughly 200 hostages the militants are holding in the Gaza Strip. The mother screamed and fell to the floor when she saw Mia’s face on her TV. She started to sing and cry, telling herself her 21-year-old French Israeli daughter had survived after vanishing Oct. 7 from a music festival targeted by Hamas militants. Then she grew scared.\n\n“I could see she was shot in the shoulder,” Keren Shem told reporters Tuesday at a news conference. It seemed as though her daughter was saying only what her kidnappers were telling her to say, she added. “I didn’t know if she was dead or alive until yesterday.”\n\nThe family and its spokespeople have transliterated their names as both Shem and Schem but used the former spelling on place cards at the news conference Tuesday.\n\nThe video, and the family’s confirmation of Mia’s identity, come as Israel prepares for a potentially deadly ground invasion of Gaza and President Biden prepares to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Hamas attacks have killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and injured more than 4,120, authorities said. Roughly 3,000 people in Gaza have been killed and more than 12,500 wounded, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nA spokesman for the militant group said Tuesday that the hostages held by Hamas face the “same danger and conditions” as people living in Gaza. Hamas has also claimed that some of the hostages have been killed by Israeli strikes, a claim that could not be confirmed.\n\nThe United Nations has called for the release of all prisoners, saying that hostage-taking is prohibited under international law. A senior Hamas official suggested Tuesday the militant group would release its hostages at “the right time” after the war.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said Shem was probably coerced to speak in the video. “It’s a propaganda video much more than it is proof of life,” Kirby said Tuesday on NBC News’s “Today.”\n\nThe Washington Post could not independently verify when the video was recorded or Shem’s current condition. But Keren Shem said she felt the video was a sign of optimism for her daughter, even as it’s clear that other hostages need medical care for potentially life-threatening injuries.\n\nIn the video, Mia Shem is shown receiving treatment for an arm injury. She then tells the camera in Hebrew she is in Gaza and underwent a medical procedure there for three hours. She pleads to be returned home.\n\nAccording to her mother, Mia Shem was kidnapped at a music festival in southern Israel that turned into a deadly massacre in which hundreds were killed and many were captured. Mia had gone with a friend “to have some fun,” her mother said.\n\nKeren Shem said she has barely slept since the day the festival was attacked. She said her daughter loves to cook and make her friends and family happy.\n\n“In the video published by Hamas, they try to portray themselves as humane,” the IDF wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “However, they are a [horrific] terrorist organization responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, children, men, women and the elderly.”\n\nWhen asked at the news conference whether she was worried Israel’s planned ground invasion could harm her daughter, Keren Shem said she was trying to focus on her daughter and called for all the hostages to be returned home and given medical care.\n\n“I’m trying not to think about the invasion into Gaza,” she said. “All I’m asking from the leaders of the world is to return my baby home in the exact condition I saw her on TV.”",

  "text": "On his way out of the Washington Capitals’ dressing room, Beck Malenstyn stopped at Connor McMichael’s stall. In a hushed moment, Malenstyn offered a word of reassurance, then patted McMichael on the back of the neck before heading toward the showers. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news.McMichael sat at his stall for a few seconds, then got up and walked out of the room alone. The 23-year-old forward was just minutes removed from committing a defensive-zone turnover that led directly to the Vancouver Canucks’ overtime winner Sunday afternoon at Capital One Arena, and it was evident his teammates were trying to pick him up in a difficult moment.\n\nWashington never trailed against NHL-leading Vancouver — until McMichael’s attempted backhand pass to defenseman John Carlson instead went straight to the Canucks’ J. T. Miller, who was all alone in the right faceoff circle. Miller quickly fired a shot past goaltender Darcy Kuemper with just 4.8 seconds left in overtime, and the Canucks poured onto the ice to celebrate their 3-2 victory.\n\n“Tough, tough finish,” Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Guys competed. We played hard in that game — and both sides. For the circumstance of both teams playing [Saturday] afternoon, extremely competitive. I thought the game was very quick. The forecheck pressure on both sides of the puck was extremely high. We did some really good things inside of that. They did some things that stressed us.\n\nMcMichael had two chances to win the game for the Capitals in overtime, but he was stopped by Canucks goaltender Thatcher Demko (31 saves) on an early breakaway and hit the post on his second opportunity two minutes later. The pass he aimed for Carlson was intended to give Washington (23-20-8) one last chance up the ice as time ticked down, but when it found Miller’s stick instead, it cut off the Capitals’ chance at taking down the top two teams in the NHL on back-to-back days after they beat the Boston Bruins on the road Saturday.\n\n“I thought [Saturday] we played a hell of a game in a very tough building against a really good hockey team, and I thought we played really well today,” center Nic Dowd said. “… I thought we played well enough to win. I mean, how many chances did we have in overtime? How many chances did our power play have? I thought our penalty kill was good. Kuemps was good. I thought we played well. I mean, that’s a good hockey team, too. We’re not going to score three, four goals a night. [A] 2-2 game going into overtime was, I thought, good. And then, I mean, whatever. S--- happens at the end.”\n\nDowd put Washington ahead just 1:08 into the game with his eighth goal of the season, a tip-in in front of Demko off a centering pass from Nicolas Aube-Kubel. Vancouver (35-12-6) tied it at 11:09 when Noah Juulsen hit Conor Garland with a stretch pass that sent Garland in alone on Kuemper, who was fooled by a wrist shot.\n\nBut perhaps drawing on the confidence from their shutout win less than 24 hours earlier, the Capitals didn’t panic. Captain Alex Ovechkin scored for the fifth consecutive game to give Washington its second lead at 7:37 of the second period, and though it came via a fortunate bounce off a Vancouver player’s skate, the goal rewarded Washington for how it had controlled play and kept pace with the speedy Canucks.\n\nNeither team could break through again for the rest of regulation. The Capitals had the better scoring chances in overtime, but it took just one McMichael mistake to end the game with Washington getting just one point rather than the two that were within reach.\n\nBefore this back-to-back, which they headed into on a six-game skid, the Capitals surely would have been pleased with taking three points from these two games. But after a four-point weekend was on the table, Sunday’s result became more difficult to swallow.\n\n“A little frustrating not getting another win, but it’s nice to get points on the board,” winger T. J. Oshie said. “[Saturday’s] win was a great steppingstone for our team. Tonight, I think we might’ve fallen back just a little bit at times, but for the most part, [we] played a good team pretty hard.”\n\nThe Capitals know how thin their margin for error is down the stretch, and they got another reminder Sunday. Their play over the past two games has shown significant improvement, but their next challenge is sustaining that. That pursuit begins Tuesday against the Colorado Avalanche, another Stanley Cup contender.\n\n“Our guys were able to play at that pace,” Carbery said. “Now we’ve just got to sustain that. It’s hard. It’s challenging. It takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of details. It takes every single guy on the same page with how it looks. It’s difficult, but that’s our challenge in front of us — to do that night in, night out, shift to shift.”",

  "text": "Jewish protesters and allies were arrested Monday after they blocked entrances to the White House to demand that President Biden urge a cease-fire in the Israel-Gaza war. The U.S. Secret Service arrested more than 30 people during the demonstration for alleged unlawful entry, such as crossing safety barricades, or for allegedly blocking entrances, Special Agent Steve Kopek, a spokesperson for the agency, said in a statement.\n\nThe demonstration, organized by Jewish groups IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace, came as Israel prepares for a major military offensive in the Gaza Strip amid an intensifying humanitarian crisis.\n\nBiden has expressed his steadfast support for Israel since the Oct. 7 attack, when gunmen from Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, broke through Israel’s border, killing more than 1,400 people and taking others into Gaza as hostages, including some American citizens.\n\nSince then, airstrikes by the Israeli military on the Gaza Strip have killed more than 2,700 people and wounded almost 10,000. Israel also announced a full siege of Gaza — where more than 2 million people live, more than half of whom are children — by cutting off essential resources such as food, water, electricity and fuel.\n\nThose protesting Monday recited Kaddish, the mourner’s prayer, sang Jewish songs and chanted “Not in our name!,” said IfNotNow communications director Matan Arad-Neeman, 25, of New York City.\n\n“Many of us are in mourning. We have loved ones who were killed and kidnapped,” said Arad-Neeman, who said an extended family member was killed in the recent violence. “We’re also angry that our grief is being weaponized and that Israel is on the brink of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians in Gaza.”\n\nArad-Neeman, who is Israeli American, said that although he is mourning alongside so many others, he does not want more violence to create more grieving Israeli or Palestinian families.\n\n“All of us are hoping and praying for a future where Israeli and Palestinians can live free of the fear of violence, and in true equality and justice,” Arad-Neeman said. “That’s why we’re here.”",

  "text": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces’ most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “every Hamas fighter” will be “destroyed,” while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n“I think they’re going to go back in, heavy, and it’s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,” said Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be “dragged out over a much longer period of time” than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities — including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people — have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would “end” the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be “impossible” for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an “integrated and coordinated attack” by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel’s offensive is “obviously going to be much larger” now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be “exponentially greater” than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in “dog fights” between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has “become very efficient” at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces’ advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas’s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn’t sustainable.\n\n“They didn’t want to go into Gaza again. They didn’t want to occupy it. They didn’t want to be responsible for administrating it,” Misztal said. “But now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?”\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel “at this time” — but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power.",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

  "text": "Some countries have announced evacuation plans for citizens in Israel using government or military airplanes. Some Israeli citizens abroad are also trying to get home in light of the growing conflict but are unable to find flights into Tel Aviv due to the widespread cancellations.\n\nIn a security alert Monday, the U. S. Embassy in Israel advised Americans in Gaza “who wish to leave and can do so safely” to check the status of Rafah Crossing,” which is the sole border crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. U.S. citizens and eligible family members in Israel, a Sunday alert said, should contact the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem or consulate in Tel Aviv for assistance using their crisis intake form.\n\nIsrael’s national airline, El Al, released an update on Monday afternoon local time saying flights were still operating as scheduled, but all flights out of Tel Aviv were leaving from a single terminal. Travelers who would not be taking scheduled flights have the option to request travel vouchers online. The airline is also waiving change fees for certain flights before Oct. 21.\n\nDelta Air Lines is canceling its flights through Tel Aviv for the rest of October, the company said in an emailed statement early Monday evening. “Our hearts are with those who are impacted as our people work to find safe alternatives for customers trying to depart TLV,” the statement said.\n\nDelta will communicate specific flight changes to customers through the Fly Delta app. The airline also said it “will continue to explore options for customers to safely exit TLV via seats that become available on our partner airlines.”\n\nAmerican Airlines has canceled all flights through Tel Aviv through Dec. 4. The company issued a travel alert with additional information on customer flexibility, including change fee waivers for flights through Oct. 21. “We continue to monitor the situation with safety and security top of mind and will adjust our operation as needed,” the airline said. Customers, it added, should visit aa.com or the airline’s mobile app for additional information on specific flights.\n\nAs of Sunday, Air Canada has also canceled flights to Tel Aviv through Oct. 12. Those with scheduled travel can either change their flight free of charge to another date through Oct. 30, or cancel and receive a full refund, according to an airline update.\n\nIn a statement posted to its website Wednesday, British Airways said it is suspending its flights to and from Tel Aviv. The carrier said it will provide customers with options “including a full refund or rebooking with another airline.”\n\nEasyJet said any customers who were affected by cancellations would be eligible for a voucher, refund, or free change to a different flight. Customers with upcoming travel plans are being encouraged to reach out to the airline directly. “Due to the situation we understand that some customers traveling in the coming days may no longer wish to travel,” the airline said.\n\nVirgin Atlantic has canceled certain flights for Tel Aviv through Oct. 11 but maintains a daily flight to and from London Heathrow. “Due to the evolving situation in Israel, some of our flights to and from Tel Aviv may face delays or cancellations,” a spokesperson said. Travelers who wish to change plans can also change their flights without a fee through at least Oct. 21, or ask for a full refund.\n\nAir France, in accordance with French and Israeli authorities, is suspending all services in Tel Aviv until further notice, per an update on the airline’s website. Flights to and from Tel Aviv have been canceled through at least Tuesday.",

  "text": "Before dawn on Saturday, Abood Okal and his family received the news they had desperately been waiting for. Okal and his wife and their 1-year-old son were finally offered a possible way out of Gaza — and back to their home near Boston. An email from the U.S. State Department told them the sole border crossing with Egypt “may be open” for a five-hour window later that day, from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Okal and his family went to the Rafah crossing only to find it closed. There were no officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing except for a few plainclothes security guards whose job was to keep people from getting too close to the gate, Okal said.\n\nThe U. S. government had negotiated a deal to allow American citizens to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt during the five-hour window, U.S. officials said Saturday. But Palestinian and Egyptian officials failed to communicate about opening it, an official at the border said. By the end of the day, no one had been able to cross.\n\nWael Abu Omar, the Palestinian spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said Palestinian officials had not had any communication with their counterparts on the Egyptian side. Egyptian media outlets reported that Cairo would only allow foreigners to cross the border if aid shipments could be delivered to Gaza.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has said it would strike any trucks coming across the border, especially trucks carrying fuel, according to a diplomatic official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nOfficials are discussing the possibility of setting up a screening mechanism that would allow the Israelis to inspect goods in each vehicle entering Gaza, the diplomat said. Another official familiar with the talks over the aid deliveries said any agreement would require “Israel to stop bombing the enclave for a few hours.”\n\nThe confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Rafah crossing comes as hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in response to an evacuation order from Israel’s military, ahead of a possible ground invasion into the besieged enclave.\n\n“We have informed U. S. citizens in Gaza with whom we are in contact that if they assess it to be safe, they may wish to move closer to the Rafah border crossing,” the spokesperson said, adding that “there may be very little notice if the crossing opens and it may only open for a limited time.”\n\nU. S. officials have spent the past several days trying to evacuate all U.S. staff in Gaza, a group of about 15 Palestinians that includes three U.S. government employees who work for USAID in Gaza, along with their immediate family members, according to a diplomatic official familiar with the situation.\n\nEach time, they’ve been stopped at checkpoints near the border inside Gaza and have been unable to leave. In some cases at these checkpoints, the diplomatic official said, people identifying themselves as Hamas have said none of them will be able to leave until aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip.\n\nCanadian officials also told citizens on Friday that the Rafah crossing might open Saturday for a five-hour window to allow Canadians to exit. Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters Saturday that the “latest information” she had was that “violence” in the area forced authorities to cancel the operation. She did not elaborate.\n\nOn Friday, Okal and his extended family had rushed south from  Jabalya in the north of Gaza after the Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate. They scrambled frantically to find cars to fit them all and a place to stay near the crossing.\n\nOkal, 36, and his family spent hours waiting under the hot sun Saturday. He said there were several hundred people there, including another American family from New Jersey. He said there were other foreign nationals too, including Canadians, Swedes, Spaniards and Norwegians.\n\nAs the day dragged on, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, took their exhausted toddler, Yousef, back to the home where they are staying with 30 other people, a short drive away. Food vendors near the crossing warned Okal that it was not safe to stay once the sun set. Still, he remained there until nearly 6 p.m., he said, hoping something might change. When he began to hear the sound of fighter planes and drones, he knew he had to leave the area.",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

  "text": "Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday’s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.\n\nPalestinian teams combed Wednesday through the blast zone — an area that radiated from a crater punched into pavement just outside the four-story complex. Cars were flipped over by the force of the explosion. Other vehicles were charred. The blast bent metal fencing and shattered windows.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said 471 people were killed and more than 300 were injured, with 28 of the injured in critical condition. The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“Because of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,” said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.\n\nIt’s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel’s military said that part of a “barrage of rockets” fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden’s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.\n\n“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.\n\nHundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.\n\nVideo verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion — a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.\n\nHospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.\n\nMore than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died — many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion — and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.\n\nRegional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan’s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war “has entered a dangerous phase,” and “will plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,” according to a palace statement.\n\nBiden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack.",

Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute that founded the court. The Palestinian territories joined the ICC in 2015, giving the court jurisdiction over crimes committed there — including in Gaza — or by Palestinian nationals in other territories.\n\nIn practice, however, international calls for justice are rarely without controversy — especially within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has roots dating to the late 19th century.",

  "text": "Twenty miles east, at Jerusalem’s popular Malha Mall, the parking lot is all but empty. Almost every shop is closed, here and across the country. Those who would normally work and shop are pouring into the ranks. Others are making their own preparations for a conflict that promises to be long-lasting and hard-hitting.\n\nPeople working in offices and fields just five days ago are back in uniform, some 360,000 of them so far, in one of the largest mobilizations in the country’s history. Schools are closed. Local governments are straining to provide services as their workforces dwindle.\n\n“We’re working under fire now, but we have no choice,” said Shaul Schneider, executive chairman of Ashdod Port, where crane operators 200 feet above the ground have to hope for the best when Hamas rockets scream overhead, sometimes 10 times a day. “Unfortunately, Israel has experience in such situations.”\n\nMuch of the country is eerily still. Streets normally jammed with honking traffic are quiet. Jaffa Street, a popular shopping strip in Jerusalem, was a ghost town Wednesday night, lined with flashing police cars. Construction sites are silent, and the Palestinian laborers who normally work at them have been prohibited from crossing over from the West Bank since Saturday.\n\nMuch of the shopping to be seen is families scrambling to stock up on essentials. Israel’s military Home Front Command instructed citizens on Monday to equip their bomb shelters and basements with three days of supplies. Apartment buildings instructed residents to remove bikes and personal items from safe rooms and stock them with emergency provisions.\n\nFor Palestinians living in Israel, staying out of sight is a basic preparation for war. All have memories of the fighting between Arabs and Jews inside Israel and say they can feel the fury being directed at Hamas.\n\nHazem, a cabdriver in Jerusalem who gave only his first name to protect his identity, has mostly stayed inside since he had his children brought home early from school Saturday. On a cabbies’ WhatsApp group, he read of a taxi driver being beaten by Jewish settlers outside the city. When he does go out, he is stopped by soldiers.\n\nIt was only hours after the Hamas attacks Saturday when Barak Zachri got the first WhatsApp message from his old combat intelligence unit. By the end of the day, dozens of members had agreed to sign up together.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, he was among those gathered on the curb outside Julis military base near Ashkelon, some in old fatigues, some in shorts and T-shirts. Another car pulled up every few minutes, setting off another set of tight hugs from parents and partners, many of them in tears. Just 12 miles away, air force planes were bombing the Gaza enclave, home to 2 million people and likely the target of an imminent ground war.\n\nReports have circulated all week that the military is struggling to equip the huge numbers of reservists reporting for duty. Army officials say their supplies are keeping up, but civilians have organized equipment and food drives across the country.\n\n“We need a switchboard, so many people are calling,” Kolinsky-Dover, the mother of two soldiers, said after fielding another cash donation offer. The Venmo account she just set up has already received more than $8,000.\n\n“One of the reasons we’re in our current situation is because Israeli society is not connected,” co-owner Yotam Doktor said. “If we don’t come to our senses and join forces, the situation will become even worse.”",

  "text": "But any sense of public comity between Washington and its Arab partners was shattered Tuesday as gruesome images emerged at the site of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian authorities say an Israeli airstrike killed up to 500 people in the attack. Israel denies the charge, saying the facility was blown up by errant rocket fire from an Islamist militant group. The White House, citing preliminary U. S. intelligence, has sided with Israel.\n\nThe hospital blast has “derailed a much-needed opportunity to make meaningful progress on the near-term solution to the Gaza crisis,” said Suzanne Maloney, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. “And by inflaming opinion across the Arab world, it has heightened prospects for escalation and a much more dangerous and protracted conflict in the region.”\n\nWhen asked what made him think that, Biden cited the “data I was shown by my Defense Department,” without elaborating. The National Security Council later issued a statement attributing the U. S. intelligence assessment to “overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information,” though so far it has not publicly disclosed any of those materials.\n\nThe United States switched, for instance, its policy seeking safe passage for Palestinian civilians through Egypt in response to meetings with Abbas and Sisi, who opposed the proposal out of fear that fleeing Palestinians may never be able to return to Gaza.\n\nThat led up to what Biden announced on Wednesday: an agreement with Israel to allow the delivery of aid on the condition that there will be inspections and that the aid won’t go to Hamas. “Israel agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move,” Biden said.\n\nBut a critical player on aid delivery is Egypt, which controls part of the Rafah border crossing, and Hamas, which controls the other half. That is why Arab leaders, who have communication links with Hamas and other key players on the ground, were viewed as a critical part of Biden’s trip.",

  "text": "No fuel has been allowed into the territory since the crisis began; many users, including the largest power plant, have run out or will soon. Nearly 1,800 people, roughly half of them women and children, have died in the bombing campaign, according to the territory’s health ministry. Another 7,300 have been wounded.\n\n“What hypocrisy!” he said in a translation of a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. “We will not provide an ounce of water and electricity to those who do not evacuate. We will work with all our might to eliminate the Hamas-Daesh murders and restore security. Whatever was will not be.” Daesh is an Arabic-language acronym for the Islamic State.\n\n“We are not going to tell Canadians to move until we know that that is a possibility and we have confirmation that these individuals can get across the border,” Julie Sunday, the assistant deputy minister for consular, security and emergency management at Global Affairs Canada, told reporters in Ottawa on Friday. “The last thing we want is Canadians getting stuck.”\n\nU. S. officials said the situation was fluid. People who said they were linked to Hamas have set up checkpoints on the Gaza side leading to the crossing. In recent days, they’ve made several, often changing demands, including that no one can leave the enclave until trucks carrying aid on the Egyptian side are allowed to enter.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matters, said heavy equipment will be needed to repair damage from the Israeli airstrikes before trucks can pass. Their Egyptian counterparts, the officials said, have been cooperative, but are concerned that any opening would unleash a flood of Palestinian refugees seeking to escape. They’ve sought U. S. assurances that none of the people the United States has asked be allowed to leave — U.S. citizens, U.S. staff, including Palestinians, and Palestinians associated with American institutions — will stay in Egypt.",

  "text": "Military officials said the village was finally secured late Monday after 2½ days of intense fighting. But with regular explosions overhead and black plumes of smoke rising above the Gaza Strip just over a mile away, the battle felt far from over.\n\nThe Israeli army escorted a group of journalists inside the town early Tuesday as the recovery of bodies was beginning. The pastoral community of about 400 is one of the closest to Israel’s sophisticated border fence with Gaza, which Hamas militants breached with apparent ease Saturday before rampaging through town after town. The burned homes and crushed cars here were surrounded by unmarked fields and groves. Water poured down the slope from a busted main.\n\nKfar Azza was still off limits to the residents who had time to flee. So many didn’t survive the shocking invasion, which shattered the peace of a weekend morning so suddenly that full cups of coffee and a jug of milk still sat on the table in one kitchen. The floor was smeared with blood.\n\nOutside, the air was heavy with the smell of smoke and death. Many of these low, boxy houses contained more bodies, said Maj. Gen. Itai Veruv — those of slain residents and perhaps more of their attackers. He couldn’t say how many.\n\nVeruv was the commander of the huge defensive operation that the Israel Defense Forces scrambled to mount after being caught badly off guard on the last day of the Jewish Sukkot holiday. He was officially retired until he heard the news, just after dawn, that villages in the south had been overrun.\n\nBy 9 a.m., he was in the area, where he stayed for three days, bearing witness to the worst scenes he has seen in 40 years of service. “I never saw anything like this,” he said. “I never imagined.”\n\nThe soldiers have tried to understand how the attack unfolded by looking at the bullet scars on the wall, and the pattern of a dozen dead infiltrators whose bodies still lay on lawns and sidewalks — among some 1,500 bodies of Palestinian militants the military says it has found across Israel. There was a crashed paraglider near a bus stop where one of the gunmen had descended from the sky. One of their motorcycles lay on its side near a pickup truck with shattered windows, its emergency lights still flashing.\n\nThe town’s small security squad — residents with guns — gathered toward the western edge of the compound when the attackers came, Veruv said. He pointed out a block of houses they called “the baby section,” because of all the young families who lived here. Those who were armed clearly fought, the soldiers said, but many didn’t survive.\n\nMost of the vehicles in a sandy parking area were heavily damaged, with bullet holes and broken windshields and doors twisted out of shape. The infiltrators apparently went down the line, looking for cars to steal. “They wanted a way to take hostages,” one soldier said.\n\nOne team loaded white body bags into the back of the truck. Another worked with six black bags, some with the Star of David, gathering them in the shade of a tree. At the entrance to the kibbutz, a crowd of Orthodox volunteers wearing yarmulkes, rubber gloves and safety vests waited  to make sure all remains had been collected, a requirement for Jewish burial.\n\nSome civilians still lay where they fell. Behind one house, a woman with bare feet and red pants had been covered with a cloth; a man in shorts was in the stream of water from the damaged main.\n\nA column of troop carriers rolled into the compound, and then another one. A tank rumbled past the farm equipment that sat idly at the edge of a field. Israel was reinforcing its hold on a community that, for days, it had lost.\n\nThe IDF said Tuesday that it was increasingly confident that the area was secure, and that its forces were preparing to go on the offensive against Hamas.",

  "text": "BEIRUT — Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel’s denial of responsibility, or Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”\n\nAn accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.",

  "text": "Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday’s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.\n\nPalestinian teams combed Wednesday through the blast zone — an area that radiated from a crater punched into pavement just outside the four-story complex. Cars were flipped over by the force of the explosion. Other vehicles were charred. The blast bent metal fencing and shattered windows.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said 471 people were killed and more than 300 were injured, with 28 of the injured in critical condition. The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“Because of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,” said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.\n\nIt’s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel’s military said that part of a “barrage of rockets” fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden’s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.\n\n“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.\n\nHundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.\n\nVideo verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion — a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.\n\nHospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.\n\nMore than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died — many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion — and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.\n\nRegional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan’s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war “has entered a dangerous phase,” and “will plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,” according to a palace statement.\n\nBiden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack.",

  "text": "Over the same period, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 60 Palestinians in the West Bank and injured more than 1,300, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has also locked down parts of the West Bank, closing roads and putting up checkpoints to prevent Palestinians from moving between towns and cities.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in 1967. Under the Oslo accords, brokered by President Bill Clinton in 1993, those territories were meant to form a Palestinian state. But the U. S.-led peace process has been dormant for years. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded. Members of Israel’s current government, the most far-right in its history, have called openly for annexation.\n\nSince 2007, when Hamas violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip, Abbas has cracked down on supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza, as well as on his own critics. Long-promised elections have never been held. Despair has deepened in the impoverished refugee camps that still dot the West Bank.\n\nOver the past two years, camps in Nablus, Jenin and elsewhere have become incubators for a new generation of armed groups that have carried out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians. Israel has responded with massive military raids across the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians here since the end of the second intifada in 2005.\n\n“The worst is yet to come,” said the 38-year-old militant, a father of three, speaking on the condition that he be identified by his childhood nickname to protect his security. Zoufi said he awoke on Oct. 7 to the news of Hamas’s rampage and asked his wife to slap him to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. Then he laughed with joy.\n\nZoufi is affiliated with Fatah but opposes the Palestinian Authority’s nonviolent approach. He founded his militant cell last year. Balata is home to some 30,000 people and has no proper police force. The same is true in other camps in Nablus and Jenin and throughout the northern West Bank. In these communities, the militants are the ones in charge.\n\n“If Israel will do a stupid thing like the ground invasion, war will break out not only in the West Bank and inside Israel but also around the Arab world,” he said. “We want liberation, not bloodshed. ... I hope it will stop before it comes to that.”\n\nMohamed Hamdan, the secretary general of Fatah in Nablus, defended Abbas and his efforts to revive peace negotiations. He said the authority was doing its best to maintain order and rein in weapons on the street. But the international community had “betrayed” the Palestinians, he said.",

  "text": "BEIRUT — A Reuters videographer was killed and six other journalists were wounded Friday in southern Lebanon when the area they were reporting from was struck by Israeli shelling, according to two colleagues who spoke to the injured journalists in the hospital, as well as an eyewitness. Charbel Francis, a cameraman for Al Araby TV, said he was filming a barrage of Israeli shelling on a hill, while standing about 50 feet from the other journalists, when the strike landed. The battle was in the distance, and there was no indication that fire from Lebanon was coming from anywhere near the journalists.\n\n“We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed,” a Reuters statement read, adding that Abdallah was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon providing live coverage of skirmishes along the border. Two other Reuters journalists, Thaer al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh, “sustained injuries and are seeking medical care,” the news agency said.\n\nThe statement did not specify who was responsible. Reuters later reported, citing one of its journalists who was at the scene, that missiles “fired from the direction of Israel\" struck the group.\n\nA spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said Saturday that it was \"very sorry” for the journalist’s death but that it was not sure who was responsible and that Israel would investigate.\n\nAl Jazeera said the journalists had all gathered in one area for safety in Alma al-Chaab, a village in south Lebanon. In video posted earlier on Friday by AFP journalist Christina Assi, who was among the injured, several reporters could be seen wearing blue bullet-resistant vests marked with the word “Press.”\n\nThe Associated Press — which had a photographer on the scene — reported that an Israeli shell landed near the group during an exchange of fire with Hezbollah. The area had previously been a target of Israeli strikes, according to a Lebanese security source cited by AFP.\n\nReporters Without Borders said Abdallah was “killed by an Israeli strike while covering the situation on the southern border” in Lebanon. The press advocacy group described it as a “heinous crime against journalists” and said it was “continuing its investigations into the circumstances of this tragedy.”\n\nAl Jazeera said in a statement that its broadcast vehicle was “completely burned,” adding it holds Israel \"responsible for this brutal attack and calls on the international community to take action to ensure the safety of journalists.”\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a mission set up in 1978 to monitor the border between Lebanon and Israel, said in a statement posted on social media that a “heavy exchange of fire” erupted in the area beginning at 5:20 p.m. Live footage carried on several news channels showed what appeared to be sustained shelling into Lebanese territory that lasted for about an hour.\n\nA live stream from the area showed the hillside as the blast hit. A woman is heard screaming “I can’t feel my legs” before the feed is cut. Lebanese television broadcasts showed a woman in a press vest writhing on the ground, with fire billowing and a car burning in the background.\n\nAbdallah, 37, a video journalist based in Beirut, had covered conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and other major stories, including earthquakes that devastated southern Turkey this year. A wide circle of colleagues, friends and admirers posted tributes to Abdallah on social media Friday, and held a vigil for him in Beirut.\n\n“He was genuinely one of the most kind and heartwarming people one could know. Totally selfless, a bundle of laughs and an extremely kind individual,” said Tariq Keblaoui, who said that a few weeks ago, Abdallah had helped him escape a protest that was being attacked.\n\nColleagues also remembered him as a “brave friend” and some journalists recounted during a funeral procession held for him on Saturday that he often told them there was “no story worth your life.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nIsrael has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars in GazaThe damage in Gaza has outpaced other recent conflicts, evidence shows. Israel has dropped some of the largest bombs commonly used today near hospitals. Data from the United Nations shows damage and destruction around al-Rantisi Hospital in northern Gaza. (MAXAR/The Washington Post) Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has been unlike any other in the 21st century.In response to the unprecedented assault by Hamas on Oct. 7, Israeli airstrikes and a ground invasion that began 20 days later have destroyed large swaths of the besieged territory, killed at least 20,057 people and displaced a vast majority of the population.The most ferocious attacks have come from the air, flattening entire city blocks and cratering the landscape.The Washington Post analyzed satellite imagery, airstrike data and U.N. damage assessments, and interviewed more than 20 aid workers, health-care providers, and experts in munitions and aerial warfare. The evidence shows that Israel has carried out its war in Gaza at a pace and level of devastation that likely exceeds any recent conflict, destroying more buildings, in far less time, than were destroyed during the Syrian regime’s battle for Aleppo from 2013 to 2016 and the U.S.-led campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, in 2017.The Post also found that the Israeli military has conducted repeated and widespread airstrikes in proximity to hospitals, which are supposed to receive special protection under the laws of war. Satellite imagery reviewed by Post reporters revealed dozens of apparent craters near 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza, where the bombing and fighting were most intense during the first two months of war, including 10 craters that suggested the use of bombs weighing 2,000 pounds, the largest in regular use.“There’s no safe space. Period,” said Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who visited Gaza on Dec. 4. “I haven’t passed one street where I didn’t see destruction of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.”Press Enter to skip to end of carouselHow we calculated this damage comparisonTo assess the devastation in Gaza, The Post used data from the U.N. Satellite Center, or UNOSAT, which analyzes satellite imagery from conflict zones to determine how many structures, most of them buildings, have been damaged and destroyed.To compare with Gaza, The Post examined UNOSAT damage data from the Russian and Syrian government campaign against rebels in Aleppo from 2013 to 2016, and from the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, which heavily bombed and shelled the cities of Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, in 2017. UNOSAT has not collected the same kind of data on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Despite the availability of other damage assessment methodologies, The Post relied on UNOSAT data because it maintained a consistent methodology over years across multiple conflict zones.The war has wounded more than 53,320 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. More than 7,700 Palestinian children have been killed, and women and children make up around 70 percent of the dead, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which also says that 1.9 million people have been displaced, equivalent to 85 percent of the population. The vast majority of Gazan civilians fleeing the invasion are not allowed by Israel and Egypt to leave.“The scale of Palestinian civilian deaths in such a short period of time appears to be the highest such civilian casualty rate in the 21st century,” said Michael Lynk, who served as the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories from 2016 to 2022.In a reply to questions from The Post, the Israel Defense Forces sent a statement saying: “In response to Hamas’ barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities. In stark contrast to Hamas’ intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.”This is the Gaza Strip. Each dot represents a damaged or destroyed structure, the vast majority of which are buildings. From the start of the war on Oct. 7 to Nov. 26, the date of the most recent data available, 37,379 structures were damaged.Of those damaged structures, 10,049 were completely destroyed.The bombing campaign and ground combat during this period were the worst in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops entered overnight Oct. 27 and fought close-quarters battles with Hamas fighters.Here, 8,561 structures were completely destroyed. These destroyed structures were among 29,732 damaged in northern Gaza alone.This is Aleppo, more than 1½ times the area of northern Gaza. Russia and the government of Bashar al-Assad waged a brutal, multiyear battle to defeat and eventually besiege rebel groups there.From 2013 to 2016, the period covered by U.N. data, 40 percent of Aleppo’s structures were damaged. In northern Gaza, that figure reached 32 percent by Nov. 26 — seven weeks into conflict.Nearly twice as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza in seven weeks as the 4,773 destroyed in Aleppo over three years.This is Mosul, roughly Aleppo’s size and also more than 1½ times the area of northern Gaza. Iraqi troops, allied militias and U.S. air forces launched an offensive to retake the city from the Islamic State in late 2016.About 1½ times as many structures were damaged in northern Gaza in seven weeks as were damaged across Mosul during the nine-month battle.Nearly twice as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza as were destroyed in Mosul over those same periods.In Raqqa, Kurdish fighters backed by the U.S.-led coalition fought to defeat the Islamic State in 2017.More than 2½ times as many structures were damaged in northern Gaza in seven weeks as were damaged in Raqqa during eight months of strikes.More than three times as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza as were destroyed in Raqqa over those same periods.Soon after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Israeli military leaders signaled their intent to retaliate with widespread devastation.On Oct. 10, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops he had “released all the restraints” and that “Gaza will never return to what it was.” The same day, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said that “while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage.”In a little over two months, Israeli air forces fired more than 29,000 air-to-ground munitions, 40 to 45 percent of which were unguided, according to a recent assessment from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The bombing rate has been about 2½ times as high as the peak of the U.S.-led coalition’s effort to defeat the Islamic State, which at its height fired 5,075 air-to-ground munitions across both Iraq and Syria in one month, according to data from the research and advocacy group Airwars.— Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee of the Red CrossOne hallmark of the 21st century’s most indiscriminate air campaigns, as in Syria and Ukraine, has been the bombing of hospitals, which cannot be attacked under the laws of war unless they are actively being used to “commit acts harmful to the enemy.”The Israeli military made no secret of its view that Gaza’s hospitals were military targets.“Hamas systematically exploits hospitals as a key part of its war machine,” Hagari, the military spokesman, said on Nov. 5. “We will not accept Hamas’s cynical use of hospitals to hide their terror infrastructure.”By Dec. 14, Israeli bombardment and fighting had forced the closure of more than two-thirds of the 28 hospitals identified by The Post in northern Gaza.As Israel’s military campaign went on, satellite imagery reviewed by The Post showed how heavy strikes around Gaza’s hospitals destroyed entire neighborhoods, wrecked infrastructure and displaced civilians, often making it impossible for hospitals to function.To assess destruction around hospitals, The Post analyzed U.N. Satellite Center data in areas within 180 meters (about 590 feet) — the distance at which the smallest commonly used bombs, weighing 250 pounds, can cause enough damage to make a building uninhabitable, and the largest, weighing 2,000 pounds, can damage a structure beyond repair, according to a report by Armament Research Services commissioned by the International Committee of the Red Cross.The data showed that Israel’s bombardment and other fighting had damaged structures within 180 meters of all of northern Gaza’s 28 hospitals.\n\nAcross northern Gaza, visual evidence and other accounts showed how Israeli forces shot at, bombed, besieged and raided hospitals.The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, Gaza’s only cancer treatment center, shut down on Nov. 1 after nearby airstrikes. At least four cancer patients died afterward, according to the Health Ministry. Al-Rantisi Hospital, the only hospital with a pediatric cancer ward, evacuated on Nov. 10 along with three nearby hospitals after being struck on Nov. 5 and surrounded by Israeli troops days later. Four premature babies left behind on breathing machines at one of the hospitals would later be found dead.Video shot by a journalist in the parking lot of al-Awda Hospital showed nearby strikes filling the air with dust and smoke and raining debris down on ambulances.Debris falls and fire explodes after an airstrike hits near al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, video posted to Instagram on Nov. 10 shows.\n\n(Feras al-Ajrami/Instagram)The Indonesian Hospital evacuated on Nov. 22, three days after artillery fire struck the hospital and killed 12 people. Israeli raids on Kamal Adwan Hospital over several days in mid-December resulted in the hospital’s “effective destruction” and the death of at least eight patients, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted on Dec. 17.In Gaza City, Israeli strikes destroyed much of the neighborhood surrounding al-Quds Hospital, operated by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Israeli forces pushing toward the center of the city fought with Hamas in the vicinity, and videos posted by the PRCS showed the impact of heavy nearby strikes. On Nov. 12, the hospital ceased operating.“What we have been witnessing is a campaign that was planned. It was a plan, definitely, to close down all the hospitals in the north,” said Léo Cans, head of mission for Palestine with Doctors Without Borders.There have been 239 attacks on health-care workers, vehicles and facilities in Gaza that have killed 570 people since the war started, the WHO said on Dec. 13.The IDF has published videos and images that show weapons and other military items, which it said were found in multiple hospitals. Underneath al-Shifa Hospital, Israeli troops excavated a tunnel with multiple empty rooms, alleging that they had been used by Hamas. The military said Hamas fighters there and elsewhere had fled before Israeli troops arrived and taken materiel with them. None of the evidence was possible to verify independently, because Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza except on strictly guided tours.“What we have been witnessing is a campaign that was planned.”— Léo Cans, head of mission for Palestine with Doctors Without Borders“Only the current misuse of the hospital deprives it of its protection, but if that misuse ends, that protection is restored,” said Adil Haque, an international law expert and Rutgers University professor. If there were a tunnel or underground structure beneath the hospital, and troops weren’t sure what was inside them, any doubts should “caution in favor of restraint,” he added.The satellite imagery reviewed by The Post revealed other evidence of how hospitals had come under attack: large craters close to hospitals, many of them bearing the telltale characteristics of large, airdropped bombs.The Post reviewed nearly 100 satellite images taken between Oct. 8 and Dec. 10 and found about three dozen apparent craters within 180 meters of 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza. At The Post’s request, five satellite imagery analysts reviewed images of each crater large enough to suggest the use of a bomb weighing 2,000 pounds or more. While The Post’s findings represent a conservative undercount of the actual number of bombs dropped near Gaza’s hospitals, the imagery shows that hardly a hospital in the north has been left untouched.Ten large craters identified by The Post near hospitals suggested the use of bombs weighing 2,000 pounds, the largest in regular use.The large craters were seen near eight hospitals, more than a quarter of all the hospitals in northern Gaza. Bombs in larger weight classes have larger blast radiuses and are more likely to inflict serious damage that could put even well-built structures like hospitals permanently out of service.At these two hospitals, for example, The Post identified large craters suggesting the use of 2,000-pound bombs within 90 meters (295 feet), the distance at which a bomb of that size could completely destroy buildings within the blast radius.At al-Awda Hospital, northern Gaza’s main maternity center, a crater in the road about 90 meters from the hospital grounds suggested the use of a 2,000-pound bomb in November.On Nov. 21, a strike on the hospital itself killed three doctors, Doctors Without Borders said.At al-Karama Hospital, north of Gaza City, two craters that appeared in Oct. 15 satellite imagery suggested the use of 2,000-pound bombs.The hospital was within the 90-meter blast radiuses of both munitions.It was forced to close on Oct. 17.Officials at humanitarian and health-care organizations with lengthy experience in major conflict zones said Israel’s war in Gaza was the most devastating they had seen.Tom Potokar, a chief surgeon with the International Committee of the Red Cross working in Gaza for the 14th time, said explosive injuries were responsible for all the wounds he and his colleagues at the European Hospital in southern Gaza had been treating. Many patients had necrotic wounds requiring amputation because of the lack of supplies and equipment at battered and besieged hospitals in the north.“For me, personally, this is without a doubt the worst I’ve seen,” said Potokar, who has worked during conflicts in South Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia and Ukraine.Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal and a doctor who worked in Aleppo during the battle for the city, said he believed that “what’s happening right now in Gaza is beyond any disaster that I’ve witnessed at least in the last 15 years or so.”Sahloul estimated it will take decades to rebuild the health-care infrastructure destroyed in Gaza and the knowledge and expertise of the scores of doctors and other health-care workers who have been killed.Preliminary data provided to The Post by Airwars suggested that strikes in Gaza were killing civilians at twice the rate of the U.S.-led campaign in Raqqa. Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, said that the data they provided The Post represented “just a fraction” of the strikes they were currently researching in Gaza, which averaged about 200 strikes per week. In Airwars’s 10 years of work, Tripp said, the group had never documented more than about 250 civilian casualty strikes per month in any conflict.“Make no mistake — U.S. operations in Iraq and Syria, especially in densely populated cities like Mosul and Raqqa, caused devastating civilian harm and destruction,” said Annie Shiel, the U.S. advocacy director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “But what we are seeing in Gaza, the level of death and destruction in this relatively short period of time, is absolutely staggering in comparison. Nowhere is safe for civilians.”“For me, personally, this is without a doubt the worst I’ve seen.”— Tom Potokar, a chief surgeon with the International Committee of the Red CrossPnina Sharvit Baruch, a former high-ranking military lawyer who was responsible for advising Israeli commanders, said that Israel is currently facing “the biggest threat to its existence” from enemies determined to destroy it. Hamas made Gaza a “fortified military area” and operates from within civilian structures, she said, adding that “Hamas’s strategy of using civilians as shields means that attacking its military capabilities leads to unfortunate yet inevitable civilian casualties.” When Israeli commanders weigh civilian harm against military advantage when deciding whether to strike, she said, the “level of threat posed by Hamas [to Israel] is a legitimate component of evaluating the military advantage.”Several humanitarian workers interviewed by The Post noted that Israel’s campaign in Gaza, and its destruction of hospitals and homes, will likely create additional suffering, such as hunger, lack of shelter and the spread of communicable diseases, that could eventually kill more people than the bombs and fighting.Sahloul said he believed the only explanation for so many attacks on civilian sites, which should have been protected by the laws of war, was that such attacks were intentional.“People in Syria told me they can tolerate bombs and missiles, but if there’s no doctors in town and no hospitals, they usually leave,” he said. “So I would have to assume that if it is intentional, the goal is to force the population to leave. And when they leave, they don’t come back.”A previous version of a graphic in this article stated that Mosul's battle lasted eight months. It lasted nine months.The quality of satellite imagery, irregular coverage and even the angle of a satellite’s camera can all affect the ability to identify clear craters. In some cases, craters could be located but not conclusively attributed to a specific munition or payload size. In other cases, damage from the air campaign was clear, but craters were not visible.The Post relied on a conservative assessment of what is and is not a crater and asked multiple experts to review any crater found in within 180 meters of a hospital in northern Gaza that had diameter of at least 40 feet, or 12.1 meters. Any crater with a diameter greater than 11.7 meters found in light soil like Gaza’s, experts said, suggests a bomb weighing 2,000 pounds or more could have been used. To account for inconsistencies in measurements, The Post relied on the slightly larger, 40-foot diameter.The Post focused its analysis on this size because a 2,000-pound bomb dropped 180 meters away could damage a building beyond repair. At 90 meters, that same munition could destroy a building. Only craters that experts agreed on with high confidence were included in this report.Experts cautioned The Post against ascribing particular damage to particular craters, as the amount of damage caused by a bomb can vary widely, especially in a dense urban environment. Damage depends on nearby structures, building materials, the soil, whether a bomb has been set to explode above or below ground, and other factors. Experts also noted that even the largest munitions can be employed to ensure that nearby civilian infrastructure is not damaged or is minimally affected when they explode. But even then, large munitions have inherent characteristics that can only be mitigated to a certain degree, making collateral-damage assessments done before the munition is used key to avoiding civilian harm, they said.Louisa Loveluck in London, Claire Parker in Cairo, Jonathan Baran in San Francisco, and Cate Brown and John Hudson in Washington contributed to this report.Design and development by Junne Alcantara and Irfan Uraizee.\n\nEvan Hill is an investigative reporter at The Washington Post focused on open-source and visual forensic techniques.

Palestinians cite a series of letters in 1915 to 1916 between Mecca’s emir and the British high commissioner in Egypt, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, as outlining a promise of an independent Arab state.\n\nIn 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly negotiated between Britain and France planned to carve up the Middle East into spheres of influence, and determined that the land in question was to be internationalized.\n\nIn 1917, Britain’s foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, expressed his government’s support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” in a letter to Baron Walter Rothschild, the head of the British wing of the influential European Jewish banking family.\n\nTo Israelis, the missive marks a formal utterance of the Israeli state’s right to exist; to Palestinians, it was an early sign of their dispossession. The declaration also noted that it was “clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” nodding to the overwhelming majority Arab population in the region at the time. (About 90 percent of the population was Muslim in 1850, and about 80 percent in 1914.)\n\nLarge-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and the Holocaust.

  "text": "White House officials are considering asking Congress for an aid package primarily aimed at supporting Ukraine and Israel that could cost as much as $100 billion, although that preliminary estimate may change as planning remains in flux, according to four people briefed on the matter. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.In conversations with congressional staffers, Biden aides have discussed proposing as soon as this week a major foreign policy package amid numerous international crises, including the war between Hamas and Israel. The legislation is also expected to include substantial funds to bolster U.S. immigration enforcement at the southern border with Mexico, and may include funds for Taiwan to deter aggression from China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations. Money to respond to recent U.S. natural disasters, including wildfires in Maui and various hurricanes, could also be folded into the legislation.\n\nAides stressed that the plans were highly uncertain and subject to change. President Biden previously proposed roughly $20.4 billion in funding for Ukraine, but Congress blocked any additional money for Ukraine when it extended government funding into November.\n\n“It’s going to make a strong statement to our enemies and to our friends,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said about the proposed aid package.\n\nOne person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said the request would cover a full fiscal year for the crises it is intended to address.\n\nDemocratic leaders said they expect to receive the proposal at the end of this week.\n\n“We intend to get the package at the end of this week and it will include the military help Israel needs, the diplomatic and intelligence help Israel needs, as well as humanitarian aid to minimize the loss of innocent human life, of Palestinians and of Israelis,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) told reporters.\n\nThe effort comes as House Republicans struggle to elect a new speaker, which could complicate efforts to pass any bill swiftly. House Republicans have grown increasingly wary of providing taxpayer funds to Kyiv, but may be more likely to do so if a request also includes money for the border and Israel.\n\nBloomberg reported earlier that White House officials were considering a $100 billion request in the aid package. It was unclear how much money would be included for each country.",

  "text": "The office of the Air Force inspector general found that while Teixeira is believed to have worked alone to smuggle classified documents from his workplace at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts — and post photographs of them online — other members in his unit “had information about as many as four separate instances of his questionable activity.”\n\n“After interviewing higher levels of the supervisory chain, it appears knowledge of these security incidents was not fully disclosed above the squadron level,” said an eight-page summary of the investigation. It added that “three individuals in the unit who understood their duty to report specific information regarding A1C Teixeira’s intelligence-seeking and insider threat indicators to security officials, intentionally failed to do so.” Some feared that security officials might “overreact,” the summary added.\n\nThe lack of action, investigators found, allowed Teixeira to share hundreds of classified pages that he posted on several online servers on the gaming chat platform Discord. It marked one of the Pentagon’s most embarrassing leaks in years, prompting outcry from allies and partners, frustration from senior defense officials, and felony charges for Teixeira, who was arrested in an FBI raid at his family’s home in Dighton, Mass., in April. Teixeira has pleaded not guilty to several related charges.\n\nRiley was removed from his command position on Nov. 1, a detail not disclosed until Monday. Dovalo already had moved on to another role, said a defense official familiar with the issue, speaking on the condition of anonymity to address personnel matters. The majority of the disciplinary decisions were made within the Massachusetts Air National Guard, the official said.\n\n“Based on the inspector general review at the end of April, we know we need to improve some of our internal processes and procedures,” he said. “We have already started to implement the corrective actions that are required, and while we need to focus on quickly this important task, we can’t lose sight of what’s ahead for the 102nd.”\n\nThe investigation was launched in April after the documents that Teixeira allegedly posted online on a closed Discord server migrated to other social media networks, including Twitter, later renamed X, and then spread virally. Officials for the Air Force said at the time that it had temporarily reassigned the mission of the 102nd Intelligence Wing — which typically scrutinizes drone feeds, satellite photography and other imagery to inform U. S. military operations — to other parts of the Air Force. That remained the case Monday, and it is not clear whether service officials intend to reinstate that intelligence mission at Otis.\n\nDovalo, one of the officers disciplined, had touted that effort in a video posted by the 102nd Intelligence Wing to Facebook in October 2021. He and other commanders with the 102nd, he said, would be “rolling out classified threat briefings for all cleared wing members, so you can better understand the depth and breadth of the global security environment for which we must be prepared.”\n\nThe Air Force also cited a disconnect between the members of the 102nd at Otis and leaders with the 201st Mission Support Squadron, an active-duty unit at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to which Teixeira and other personnel were assigned administratively while working in full-time roles. While National Guard leaders can discipline their own people, they must coordinate with an active-duty unit when a member is on active-duty orders, investigators noted.",

  "text": "Adding to the risks of Biden’s trip was a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that killed at least 500 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter, while the Israel Defense Forces blamed an errant rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying “a barrage of rockets” was passing near the hospital when it was hit.\n\nThe hospital blast has set off fierce protests in the Middle East, including in Jordan, where the Israeli Embassy was surrounded by protesters Tuesday evening. A planned visit by Biden to Amman on Wednesday was canceled after the strike, forcing the U. S. president to forgo a scheduled meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nSome security experts said the physical risk to Biden would be relatively small despite the chaos in the region. Biden is one of the most protected people on the planet, they said, and Air Force One is equipped with sophisticated air defense systems that can thwart incoming rockets and missiles.\n\nStill, it’s a rarity for a president to travel directly into a region where hostilities are intensifying, with an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza expected within days and fears that the militant group Hezbollah might enter the fray. Biden faces at least some risk when he is on the ground in Tel Aviv, a city Hamas rockets are able to reach. In Amman, which Biden had planned to visit after his stop in Tel Aviv, the situation remains combustible.\n\n“Being in an active area of hostilities, they have to look very carefully at the threats that Israel is facing now, understanding that the president will be on the ground,” said Jonathan Lord, senior fellow and director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security. “So they’re definitely thinking about Israel’s air defense capabilities and protecting the president from Hamas rockets.”\n\nThe crisis erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants broke through Israel’s sophisticated border fence with Gaza and hunted Israeli civilians in their cars and homes, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages into Gaza, including some Americans. Tensions have only grown since then as the brutality and scope of Hamas’s attacks have become clearer and as Israel has launched repeated deadly airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nBiden’s visit comes as Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion that it says is an effort to destroy Hamas, potentially setting off one of the worst conflicts in the region in decades. U. S. officials are deeply concerned that the war could spread and draw in such actors as Hezbollah or Iran.\n\nBiden has stressed his ironclad support for Israel since the Hamas attacks, but in recent days, he has sought to strike a more delicate balance between support for Israel’s right to self-defense and concern about civilians in Gaza, where conditions have rapidly deteriorated.\n\nGaza is a densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. Even without a formal occupation, Israel controls almost all aspects of life in the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, water, electricity and fuel — tactics that human rights groups have said violate international law.\n\nThe country has also unleashed an unrelenting bombardment campaign and warned more than 1 million Palestinians to flee northern Gaza to avoid being in harm’s way, an order that the United Nations called impossible. Biden and his top aides have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors so that Palestinian civilians can flee and aid can get into the Palestinian territory.\n\nExperts said Biden’s trip to Kyiv this year was in some ways more dangerous than the Israel trip because Russia has a far more sophisticated military than Hamas. Although Hamas is arguably a far more unpredictable entity, its militants are unlikely to have the technology or prowess to launch a targeted attack against an American president.\n\n“The risk to the president himself is probably pretty minimal. He is surrounded by Secret Service and the Israelis will provide additional protection layers,” Riedel said. He added that Biden flying in and out of the Middle East in one day, rather than staying in an easily identifiable location overnight, further minimizes the risks.\n\n“I think we have seen a significant shift in the administration’s position,” Riedel said. “On October 7th, it was, ‘We’re 100 percent behind Israel. We have Israel’s back.’ We’re still behind Israel, we still have Israel’s back — but we’re also eager to avoid significant civilian casualties in Gaza and we do not want the conflict to spread to other areas.”",

  "text": "BEIRUT — Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel’s denial of responsibility, or Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”\n\nAn accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.",

  "text": "As a shoe cobbler, Jim McFarland has spent his career with his eyes trained downward on his work. He never expected anyone to care much about his craft. But McFarland, 59, now has more than 1 million followers on TikTok and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. He posts videos of his work as a cobbler — from replacing thin soles to fixing zippers, reviving rubber heels to adding customized touches to timeworn pieces. McFarland breathes new life into seemingly unwearable shoes from his shop in Lakeland, Fla.\n\n“If you would have told me three years ago that shoe repairs could have a stage, I would have laughed,” McFarland said from his shop, McFarland’s Shoe Repair, while shining a pair of leather dress shoes from the 1980s. “I can’t believe all these people enjoy it.”\n\nViewers are mesmerized by McFarland’s careful cobbling, which usually involves a combination of meticulously dissecting old shoes and reconstructing them until they appear new. While McFarland often uses a sanding machine, he does most of the work by hand and with basic tools.\n\n“It takes three to five years to learn the trade,” said McFarland, who comes from a long line of cobblers. He learned from his father, who learned from his father, who learned from his uncle. “This is my family heritage, my history. We’ve been at it a long time.”\n\nMcFarland’s great-uncle had a shoe repair shop in Anderson, Ind., in the early 1900s. McFarland’s grandfather was his apprentice, and by 1920, he had his own shop. McFarland’s father also learned the trade and launched a chain of shoe repair shops in Lakeland, Fla., in 1967. McFarland’s Shoe Repair, which opened in 1981, is the only one left.\n\nAs a teen, McFarland wasn’t keen on becoming a cobbler. When he was 20, though, his father got sick, and McFarland dropped out of college to help him run the family business. He ultimately took over.\n\nThe shoe repair industry has been dwindling for decades, with only about 3,500 repair business scattered across the country. Between 2018 and 2023, the number of cobbling businesses has shrunk 2.4 percent per year on average.\n\nAs McFarland’s videos began to take off, people across the country who were struggling to find local cobblers started asking if he would accept mail-in shoe repairs. While he had never done it in the past, McFarland said, mail-in orders now make up about 50 percent of his business.\n\nMcFarland is an advocate for buying high-quality shoes and mending them as needed, rather than purchasing inexpensive and trendy shoes that tend to not weather well. He said he frequently fixes shoes that are more than 40 years old. When he’s finished with them, “they’ll be good for probably another 30 to 50 years if you take care of them,” he said.\n\n“With all of the stuff that we have on this planet — stuff that is made out of plastic and polyester and stuff that is not going to biodegrade in the landfill — we need to keep it in the rotation for as long as possible,” said Rebecca Harrison, 32, the founder of Old Flame Mending, a tailor in Avalon, Pa., that specializes in reviving old garments.\n\n“People do become very attached to their garments,” she said, adding that Old Flame Mending does everything including total overhauls and simple tailoring. She offers visible mending services, which have become increasingly popular.\n\nThe method “originated when the Japanese didn’t have enough resources to replace fabric,” Futatsuya explained. “Stitching was done for making fabric stronger or warmer, so they did not have to mend so often.”\n\n“Sashiko is more than just stitching or design or patterns,” said Futatsuya, who lives in Lewisburg, Pa., and, like McFarland, shows his work on social media. “Sashiko for me is a way to add a story with stitching.”",

  "text": "Around the world, thousands of people were delighted to see that she and her mate Shadow are faring well in the storm — which brought record-setting rains, winds and prolific snow to California during a days-long onslaught that caused mudslides, widespread power outages and at least nine deaths.\n\n“People have been worried about Jackie sitting in the snow,” said Sandy Steers, biologist and executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley, which set up a 24-hour, solar-powered camera above the nest in 2015. “But she and Shadow have over 7,000 waterproof feathers, with down feathers under that. Basically, they’re each wearing a waterproof down jacket, so they’re doing fine.”\n\nHeightening the concern for this year’s eggs is that Jackie has had a low rate of success over the years with her eggs, and last year, Jackie and Shadow abandoned two eggs when they didn’t hatch.\n\nJackie and Shadow, age 10, attract a flock of watchers to the live stream during nesting season, similar to the thousands of delighted fans who saw three eaglets hatch in the D. C. area. And last February, a Minnesota eagle went viral for sitting on her eggs while buried in snow.\n\nDuring the recent storm in California, Jackie sat in a snow-filled nest for 62 hours until she flew away for a break and let Shadow take a turn as the storm let up, Steers said.\n\n“When the weather is bad, she likes to handle the nesting — she doesn’t trust anyone to do it better,” she said. “If Jackie wants to take over, she’ll just move Shadow aside.”\n\nTraffic picked up on the nest cam when it was discovered last month that Jackie had laid three eggs: One on Jan. 25, the second on Jan. 28, and the third on Jan. 31, Steers said, noting that the incubation period for the eggs is 35 days.\n\n“That means that if everything goes well, we could see an egg hatch on Feb. 29 — Leap Day,” Steers said. “This is Jackie’s first clutch of three eggs, so everyone is very hopeful.”\n\n“We’re all watching and hoping that the eggs hatch and the babies become successful fledglings,” said Steers. Baby eaglets usually leave the nest when they’re about three months old, she said.\n\nStudies show that about 70 percent of eaglets now survive their first year in the wild, according to the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service. That’s a dramatic increase since 1963, when bald eagles were an endangered species, largely due to pesticides. Just 417 nesting pairs were known to exist. In 2020, government studies found there were an estimated 316,700 eagles nesting in the Lower 48 states.\n\n“It would take an autopsy on the eggs to figure out why [they didn’t hatch],” she added. “Last year, ravens ended up getting the two eggs she laid. They hadn’t developed at all after 40 days, so perhaps they froze early in their development, or they weren’t fertilized.”\n\nThe Big Bear eagle pair have been together in their six-foot nest since 2018, when Jackie’s former mate, “Mr. B,” was chased away by Shadow, Steers said.\n\nThe couple have been spotted tenderly nibbling each other’s beaks during breeding season, Steers said, and Shadow will often bring sticks and lay them on top of Jackie while she’s sitting on her eggs.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\n‘Connie the Container Dog,’ saved by the Coast Guard, needs a new homeAn animal rescue in the DMV is looking for the 2-year-old dog’s forever home “Connie the Container Dog” was rescued after at least a week stuck inside a shipping container on Jan. 31. (Andrea Deoudes)The moment Andrea Deoudes laid eyes on Connie, she resolved to help find her a forever home. Deoudes first saw photos of the 2-year-old fluffy brown dog during a late-night Facebook scroll. The pup had been dubbed “Connie the Container Dog” by U.S. Coast Guard members who last week found her trapped inside a shipping container stacked high in the air at the Port of Houston.Connie had been stuck in the container without food and water for at least a week, according to the Coast Guard.U.S. Coast Guard members rescued a dog that was trapped in a shipping container over a week in Houston on Jan. 31. (Video: Storyful)Deoudes, the founder of the Maryland-based Forever Changed Animal Rescue, figured offers to help Connie would be flooding in after the Coast Guard’s now-viral rescue posts. But she and her colleagues still tried, and on Tuesday, Connie arrived by plane to Virginia, where she is now staying with Deoudes.Now, her goal is to find Connie a safe home in the D.C. area.“I thought, ‘What a survivor to make it through all of that,’” said Deoudes, who also works as a veterinarian.Staff treated Connie like a celebrity when she arrived at Deoudes’s office Tuesday. Everyone wanted to greet the “Container Dog” and snap photos with her.During an initial exam, Deoudes found that Connie’s thick fur coat had hidden her malnourishment. There was another surprise, too: An ultrasound revealed that the dog was pregnant.“While it seems like a really happy thing, it’s also tough because let’s say she has five puppies — those are five dogs that will be adopted into homes,” Deoudes said. “And there’s already five puppies alive somewhere else that may be euthanized because they’re not going to be get adopted.”Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Jose Reyes, who helped rescue Connie, said the dog’s barking might’ve saved her from being shipped overseas.He and three other Coast Guard members happened to hear her during a routine inspection. Normally, they would have skipped that section of the Houston-area terminal, but car trouble caused them to stop near Connie’s container, Reyes said. As soon as they stopped, Reyes and his colleagues heard barking.Minutes passed, and the barks continued. The Coasties frantically tried to find the source, Reyes recalled. Finally, realizing the only direction they hadn’t looked was up, they determined the noise was coming from a container stacked about 25 feet in the air.The container was bound for Dubai, he said.“That was our moment of ‘Oh no, we should probably do something about this,’” Reyes said.The Coast Guard members alerted port officials, who brought in a crane to start moving containers. When the container with the dog was lowered, the barking got louder along with the sound of scratching against metal. When the container door was opened, Connie’s nose poked out.“She walked out on her own immediately,” Reyes said. “She was very, very happy to see all of us.”The shipping container was full of totaled vehicles and car parts, Chief Petty Officer Corinne Zilnicki, a Coast Guard spokeswoman, said in a statement. It’s not clear how Connie ended up in the container, Zilnicki said, adding that she may have been living in a junkyard and was accidentally loaded into the container.On the way to an animal shelter in Pasadena, Tex., after the rescue, Reyes said Connie was in someone’s lap the whole ride.“She just wanted to be pet the entire time,” he said.Johana Murillo, the assistant manager of the Pasadena Animal Shelter, said Connie had no microchip and needed to be treated for heartworm. They gave her vaccinations and flea- and tick-prevention medication but realized she required more care, Murillo said.That same day, the Pasadena Animal Shelter received an email from Deoudes’s colleague offering to care for Connie. The Texas shelter quickly agreed and Connie was flown out to Virginia on Tuesday.Forever Changed Animal Rescue will care for Connie until her heartworm treatment is complete and she gives birth to her litter, which will also be closely monitored in the coming weeks. Then the dogs will all be put up for adoption in the DMV, barring major health concerns.“We know we will find her an amazing home,” Deoudes said. “It’s going to be tough because we’re going to receive a million applications.”‘Connie the Container Dog,’ saved by the Coast Guard, needs a new homeFans root for bald eagles determined to shield eggs from California stormSign in or create a free account to save your preferences",

  "text": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden’s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country’s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza’s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael’s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n“We all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,” Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. “They go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid.",

  "text": "Skip to end of carouselNew reporting by The Washington Post and “Frontline” reveals details about Jack Teixeira’s alleged leak of classified U. S. intelligence on the Discord chat platform, his possible motivations and the red flags officials missed.Based on a collaborative months-long investigation, “The Discord Leaks” examines one of the biggest leaks of government secrets in U.S. history. The documentary is available to watch on pbs.org/frontline and washingtonpost.com.“While the Trust & Safety team makes life difficult for bad actors,” the company’s founders wrote in 2020, “our users play their part by reporting violations — showing that they care about this community as much as we do.” Discord also allows users to immediately and permanently delete material that hasn’t previously come to their attention, often rendering it impossible to reconstruct even at the request of law enforcement. The Washington Post and “Frontline” found that Teixeira took advantage of this feature to destroy a full record of his alleged leaking.People familiar with the FBI’s investigation credited Discord with responding more quickly to law enforcement requests than many other technology firms. But Discord says it had no real-time visibility into Teixeira’s activity — offering him time and space to allegedly share classified government documents, despite a slew of warning signs missed by the company.Discord’s troubles are not unique in Silicon Valley. Mainstream social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube have weathered years of criticism over algorithms that push disinformation and ideological bias, opening doors to radicalization. TikTok has been blamed for promoting dangerous teen behavior and a dramatic rise in antisemitism on the platform. And X, formerly Twitter, had its trust and safety team gutted after Elon Musk purchased the platform and allowed two prominent organizers of the Charlottesville rally, Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler, to buy verification.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nJack Teixeira got security clearance despite history of violent threatsAs he tapped anxiously at his computer keyboard one afternoon in early spring, Charles wondered when the FBI would arrest his best friend. He had last spoken to Jack Teixeira online two days earlier. Teixeira had said to “keep low and delete any information that could even possibly relate to him.” The next day, he “went ghost mode … just went off the internet,” Charles said.Teixeira was not on the run, but he was frantic. Over the past year, he had shared an enormous amount of highly classified government intelligence with about two dozen friends in a virtual clubhouse that they had set up on Discord, a digital platform especially popular with video gamers. It let Teixeira and his friends — who, like Charles, were mostly teenage boys — talk and play together online.For more than two years, they had hung out nearly every day, and in the throes of covid lockdowns, usually all day.Teixeira was just 21, but he was enlisted in the Massachusetts Air National Guard and worked as a computer technician inside an intelligence facility at a military base on Cape Cod. The job came with a top-secret security clearance that gave Teixeira access to computer networks containing some of the most highly classified information in the U.S. government. The boys looked up to him like an older brother or world-wise uncle.Charles said the tightknit group of friends, who shared a love of guns and military hardware, understood not to share outside their circle the classified information that Teixeira brought home from work. But just over a month earlier, in late February, and unbeknownst to the group, one of their members started to post around 50 documents to another space on Discord, known as a server. Someone on that server shared them, too, and soon the documents were spreading across the platform, available to thousands of users.It took the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies weeks to notice. By early April, the documents had popped up around the wider internet, including on social media channels frequented by pro-Russian propagandists. Federal law enforcement agents were hunting for the leaker and racing to mop up a flood of secrets.Charles and his online friends knew the authorities were looking for Teixeira. He “seemed very confused and lost as to what to do,” said Charles, who is a minor and agreed to recount his experience on the condition that only his middle name be used and with the permission of one of his parents.Charles estimated that Teixeira had posted about 350 documents, which he removed from work and photographed at home with his phone, along with many hundreds more that he had typed by hand into the server’s chat box. The documents revealed secrets obtained by nearly every element of the U.S. intelligence community, including the National Security Agency, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, law enforcement agencies and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), arguably the most secretive spy agency in the government, responsible for a multibillion-dollar constellation of satellites.Other intelligence leaks in recent years had offered deep insights into particular operations of the military or the intelligence community, or exposed the inner workings of a single department. The huge cache of information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that Chelsea Manning gave to WikiLeaks in 2010 offered a fly-on-the wall view of military operations and diplomatic maneuverings. The NSA briefing documents revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013 uncovered the nitty-gritty of electronic surveillance.The disclosures allegedly from Teixeira were remarkable for their breadth and timeliness. The documents, hundreds of which The Washington Post obtained, touched on seemingly every hot-button issue and global trouble spot that America’s spies were watching. And they were of recent vintage, spanning a period from around February to March, offering deep insights on events that were developing by the day. They reflected Teixeira’s omnivorous appetite for information about global affairs. It was as if he had gone to the secrets buffet and sampled one of every dish.Teixeira was arrested on April 13. He has pleaded not guilty to six counts of illegal retention and transmission of national defense information, crimes that could send him to prison for years if he is convicted.In the eight months since his arrest, federal law enforcement investigators and top intelligence officials, as well as Teixeira’s online friends, have struggled to understand what may have driven him to carry out one of the biggest classified intelligence disclosures in years. Nothing about Teixeira fit the profile of the traditional leaker. He wasn’t trying to expose official misdeeds. He wasn’t a principled whistleblower. Why would he give classified documents to a bunch of teenagers?Documents and interviews by The Post in partnership with “Frontline” with more than four dozen people, including those who knew Teixeira online and in real life, as well as national security officials and experts, offer the most detailed account yet of his motivations, how he allegedly obtained so many national security secrets and how he was caught.Skip to end of carouselNew reporting by The Washington Post and “Frontline” reveals details about Jack Teixeira’s alleged leak of classified U.S. intelligence on the Discord chat platform, his possible motivations and the red flags officials missed.Based on a collaborative months-long investigation, “The Discord Leaks” examines one of the biggest leaks of government secrets in U.S. history. The documentary is available to watch on pbs.org/frontline and washingtonpost.com.The answers are alarming and at times bewildering. They expose how vulnerable the Pentagon is to a threat from within and the vast proliferation of top-secret information across the government. Teixeira used his privileged access to read intelligence documents and reports that had nothing to do with his assigned duties. His superiors caught him in the act several times but did not remove him from his job.Teixeira was intensely interested in the war in Ukraine and other high-stakes matters of global security. He posted classified information in part to educate his friends, but also apparently to show off and demonstrate that he knew things most people did not.His online world was a hothouse of racist and violent rhetoric, suffused with conspiracy theories. He sought out classified information to validate his baseless suspicions that federal law enforcement was complicit in mass violence as part of a plot to subdue and control the citizenry.For Teixeira, information was power, and classified information appeared irresistible.Teixeira’s mother, father and stepfather declined requests to speak with The Post and “Frontline.” Teixeira and his lawyers declined to be interviewed. Several U.S. officials declined interview requests, citing the pending criminal case. The Defense Department would not discuss the decision to grant Teixeira a security clearance.Intelligence officials said the trove Teixeira is accused of revealing was extraordinarily damaging, full of details about the course of the Russia-Ukraine war, including troop casualty numbers that neither Moscow nor Kyiv had publicly shared. They discussed Ukrainian planning for sabotage operations and demonstrated that the United States was monitoring the communications of the Russian military, as well as Ukrainian generals and political leaders. And they revealed the remarkably bleak outlook for a coming Ukrainian counteroffensive, at a time when American and European officials were publicly bullish about it.Teixeira posted photographs taken by a U.S. surveillance plane of the Chinese spy balloon that drifted across North America two months before he was arrested. Other documents detailed North Korean drones, tense U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan’s vulnerability to an invasion by China.U.S. officials had another reason to panic when they saw what Teixeira had stolen. Every piece of intelligence offered some hints as to how the spy agencies had obtained it, threatening valuable sources of the information and endangering the people who passed secrets to U.S. spies. One document identified a little-known advanced satellite system for capturing images of objects on the ground. Outing the system could make it more susceptible to Russian jamming or interference, U.S. officials said. Another document identified a person who gave details to the Dutch military intelligence agency about Ukraine’s plan to blow up the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines. That information, once exposed, risked the life of the source, Dutch officials feared.Charles was convinced that if Teixeira didn’t leave the country, the FBI would essentially disappear his friend: “He’ll be sent to Guantánamo.”Teixeira had warned the boys that federal authorities were “nefarious,” Charles said, capable of fiendish abuses. He claimed without evidence that “the feds” knew in advance of the racist May 2022 mass killing in Buffalo, among other massacres, and let them happen to create a pretext for tightening gun-control laws, Charles said. The boys received Teixeira’s baseless and conspiratorial pronouncements as insider confirmation of the dim views they already harbored.“Everyone in the server was not a fan of federal agents and thought they did no good,” Charles said. He was determined to keep his friend safe and free as long as possible.Teixeira’s real-life friends, the ones who had known him since childhood in Dighton, Mass., weren’t surprised he joined the military. He had aspired to uniformed service. And from a young age, he had been fascinated with military history and weaponry.As a middle-schooler, Teixeira read books on World War II aircraft, sometimes carrying one around like a child might cling to a favorite toy. Preston LaBree, who met Teixeira in middle school, remembers him immersed in the world of fighter planes. “He was kind of goofy. … But he was very mature in the sense that he had real passions,” LaBree said.Another passion was video games. Gaming became a social nucleus for Teixeira and his friends. “We’re all little kids. We don’t have cars. We all loved video games, probably at times more than life itself,” LaBree said. They played violent shooter games like “Grand Theft Auto V” or “Call of Duty.”Voice chat technology let Teixeira and his friends play together from their separate homes. “It was just so easy to catch each other on PlayStation,” LaBree said. “It was just an everyday thing.” The digital playroom became a space where the kids could be themselves.“You make jokes with each other that you wouldn’t make with your mom or your dad or students who aren’t a part of a group,” LaBree said. “[Teixeira] was good at being funny.” LaBree said the kids developed a kind of shorthand, what he called “greenroom talk,” after the kinds of inside and off-color jokes he imagined stand-up comics tell each other backstage.As Teixeira got older, video games let him show off his weapons expertise. But his fondness for military trivia became pedantic. When other players called the weapons, vehicles and gear by the wrong names, he corrected them. “He’s like, ‘Well, actually …’” LaBree said. “I’m like, ‘Bro, I’m just trying to steal this car.’”Teixeira’s fascination with warfare translated to the classroom, where, despite generally middling grades, he received A’s in U.S. history, world cultures and civilizations, and a class his junior year on “contemporary world affairs,” according to his transcript from Dighton-Rehoboth Regional High School. He took vocational classes in automotive technology and metal work. His lowest grade senior year was a C-plus in computer science, which would become his field of work in the military.His online friends said that Teixeira bristled at the structure of an academic environment. “I don’t think he liked the way school treated him … the way it was set up,” said a young woman who dated Teixeira and agreed to discuss their relationship using only her online handle, “Crow.”Teixeira and Crow, who lived in different states and met online, spent hours together on Discord, including in private video chats apart from the younger kids. For a time, she was part of the same server on which Teixeira shared classified government documents, but she had left the group before he did so. He was smart and a good conversationalist, but also temperamental, she said.Teixeira  had graduated from high school, but he still appeared to hold grudges. “There were many late-night calls where he would rant to me about school,” Crow said. “How much he hated his [English] teacher and how much he hated some people, and he hated the principal, and how he wishes he could have shot up the school, how he should have done it.”In March 2018, his sophomore year, a group of students reported Teixeira to the administration after they heard him “talking about Molotov cocktails and guns,” according to a copy of a Dighton police report that The Post and “Frontline” obtained following an official records request. Teixeira allegedly told one student, “I’ve got a moly [molotov cocktail] in my bag!” and asked, “What would you do if I threw one down the hall?” Another student said Teixeira made a similar statement to him about throwing the explosive at school.Two teachers who had been trained on how to respond to a school shooter, and to spot warning signs of violence in their students, also expressed concerns about Teixeira “because of how much he talks about guns,” according to the police report.A month earlier, Teixeira had shown classmates at a lunch table a video of someone apparently killed in battle in the Middle East. “Look at this!” Teixeira said “with a smile, almost as if he was excited,” the police report said.Dighton police also took statements from several students who said Teixeira had made violent threats against Black people. They told investigators that Teixeira said, “I want to kill all Black people,” “Black people don’t exist,” and “I hate n-----s,” according to the police report. One student said Teixeira used the phrase “I want to kill all Black people” in his automotive class “a lot.”One female student who reported Teixeira to administrators told police that he “makes racist comments and is always talking about guns or war and that she had also heard about him killing animals,” according to the report. The student also noted that Teixeira was attempting to obtain a firearms identification card “and that someone should know about it.” In the state of Massachusetts, the card permits the possession of “non-large-capacity rifles, shotguns, and ammunition.”A Dighton police officer interviewed Teixeira, in the presence of his mother and stepfather. Teixeira confirmed he had made the statements about molotov cocktails and guns, but he claimed that they were taken out of context. He was talking with the two students about the video game “Call of Duty” and how to obtain the weapons within the game, Teixeira said, according to the police report. The students contradicted that account and told police they had discussed the game with Teixeira, but that he made his alarming remarks during a separate conversation.Ultimately, Teixeira was suspended from school for one day and required to take a psychological risk assessment before returning to class. His stepfather, Thomas Dufault, an Air Force master sergeant, told the police officer he was concerned the incident might hurt Teixeira’s chance of joining the military.It did not. Teixeira enlisted in the Massachusetts Air National Guard in 2019 and obtained his security clearance two years later.As part of his clearance application, the Defense Department conducted a standardized background investigation, which required that Teixeira fill out a lengthy personal questionnaire. Investigators would be expected to interview his friends and associates. The process is intended to find any information that might suggest the applicant isn’t fit for a position of trust handling classified information. Excessive debts, ties to foreign governments and violent or criminal behavior are all potentially “derogatory” factors that the Defense Department may use when deciding whether to grant or deny a security clearance.By Teixeira’s own account, his suspension from school came up in his background check.“Everything was explained to the investigator about the incident as well as police reports, school letters and any or all documents that were submitted to the investigator that were generated from this event,” Teixeira wrote in November 2020 to a Dighton police officer, when he was trying for a third time to obtain his firearms identification card. (His previous applications were denied because of the disturbing reports from his classmates.)Teixeira, by then assigned to be a computer technician at the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base, pointed to his successful clearance application and his military service in support of his request for a firearms ID card. This time, it was granted.Experts said that Teixeira’s violent, racist remarks at his high school were the kind of derogatory information that should have been weighed in his application for a security clearance.“Security clearances are all about a predictive analysis of the risk to the United States,” said Mark Zaid, an attorney specializing in national security law. “You have to be able to protect national defense information. People’s lives may be at stake depending on what the information is that you have access to. Obviously someone who has a proclivity towards violence, that raises red flags.”Experts said that background investigators and security officials sometimes view troubling incidents that occurred when the applicant was a minor as youthful indiscretions that aren’t disqualifying. But it’s unclear how the Pentagon’s decision-makers weighed the police report, or even if they were aware of it, as Teixeira claimed.After this story was published, the Defense Department released a report by the Air Force inspector general, which determined that “some negative information was discovered” in the course of Teixeira’s background check. The report didn’t provide specifics but noted that “there were indications that [Airman 1st Class] Teixeira could have been subject to enhanced monitoring” at work as a result of what the background check had turned up.But that negative information wasn’t shared with Teixeira’s unit, the inspector general found. “[H]ad the unit been made aware of potential security concerns identified during the clearance adjudication process, they may have acted more quickly after identifying additional insider threat indicators,\" the report concluded.The Defense Department denied repeated requests from The Post and “Frontline” for additional information about Teixeira’s background investigation and the decision to grant his clearance and did not respond to questions about the police report. The department would not grant an interview with an official from the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, which adjudicates clearance decisions. The Post has sued under the federal Freedom of Information Act for records about Teixeira’s case.In the 2020 letter to the Dighton police officer, Teixeira sounded contrite.“I said some things … that were inappropriate, and unfortunately I was insensitive to the current events going on at other schools,” Teixeira wrote. He did not mention guns or molotov cocktails, and he did not apologize directly for his alleged racist remarks. “I lacked some of the social disciplines and the situational awareness needed at that time to make a logical decision on how to express myself verbally. … I never looked at how people reacted to what I said, and I didn’t think it would matter or affect my life. I understand now that I couldn’t have been more wrong.”Teixeira said he had learned his lesson. But at the time he wrote that apology, he was emerging as the leader of his tiny Discord club. And in their online hangout, violent threats and racist jokes were typical conversation.In March 2020, local governments across the United States began issuing the first restrictions related to covid-19. Schools closed and students moved their studies online. For Teixeira and his friends, their worlds collapsed to the size of a computer screen.“Every day, you’d wake up, I’d do whatever, maybe schoolwork and then get on the voice channel or text, and we’d all just sit there for hours and talk and play games,” said one young gamer who met Teixeira during the pandemic lockdowns on a Discord server for fans of Oxide, a popular YouTuber who streamed videos about guns, body armor and military hardware. The gamer, who was 16 at the time, agreed to an interview on the condition that he be identified by his online handle, “Pucki.”“A lot of us lived in parts [of the country] in which you could not go outside and go meet new people. And so for someone like me, who had just became a teenager, and I didn’t know anyone because I just moved to a new town, this was the perfect opportunity for me to bond with my new friends that I just met online,” said Charles, who also met Teixeira on the Oxide  fan server during the lockdowns.The server attracted large crowds and could “feel more like a town square where you can’t quite reach everyone, but you can catch one or two people in the street and have a good discussion with them,” said Charles, who first got on Discord when he was 13. Craving more intimacy, a few of the members decided to peel off and create a new server. Pucki served as the administrator, essentially controlling who was admitted by invitation only.Accounts differ on why the young gamers decided to form a new hangout. Some said they wanted to have narrower discussions about military hardware. Others said the members were kicked out for making racist and antisemitic jokes, after they’d been warned to stop.Teixeira, who had completed his Air Force basic training the previous August, also joined the new server. Pucki was nominally in charge, but the younger boys increasingly saw Teixeira as their leader.“Anytime he entered the room, mood changed. Stuff’s going down, this is going to be fun. We’re going to have a good night,” Charles said. “He was funny. He was charismatic. And then he was also really good at games.”Teixeira brought a level of credibility to the discussions of guns and gear that no other member of the server possessed.“People on that server looked up to him,” said Crow, who also was a member. “They wanted to be like him. … If he bought a game, everyone else bought a game.” In their private conversations, Crow, who lived in Texas, said Teixeira could drop the leader pose and become vulnerable. “One-on-one with him, he was much more of a genuinely sweet person.” But Crow also said her boyfriend could be “thin-skinned.”“There were quite a few times he’d go on rants about certain guns or certain things because someone had doubted his knowledge on something, and so he wanted to prove that he knew it,” Crow said.The two — who never met in real life — broke up in early 2022.As the pandemic wore on, the group grew closer. Many lost touch with real-life friends. Eventually, in the fall of 2021, Teixeira took over as the owner of the server, and the character of the clubhouse began to change, starting with the name.Members of the server occasionally changed its name, sometimes in a nod to an inside joke. Around mid-2022, they chose a new name that many still struggle to explain as anything but a racist, homophobic slur: Thug Shaker Central.“Thug shaker,” originally a line from a gay porn film, refers to a category of online memes, in which Black men shake their bare buttocks. The clips are frequently used as a bait-and-switch, tacked on to innocuous videos or other memes.“It was an inside joke to change the server name,” Pucki said. “We thought it was hysterical, so Thug Shaker Central. Screw it!”The choice of server name reflected the members’ bigoted banter. Members frequently used the n-word. Teixeira referred to mainstream press as “zogshit,” appropriating a popular white-supremacist slur for the “Zionist Occupied Government.” The kids made jokes about 9/11 and the Holocaust. They made light of the 2019 mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that left 51 people dead.The server became the center of some members’ online lives. “It was constant contact,” Pucki said. “It was like you were living with these people, almost. You could always message someone, ping them, mention them, say, ‘Hey dude, get on.’ … The topic was racist, edgy. Gore was posted. You’d post videos of jihadi beheadings and things like that or cartel killings. You’d be like, ‘Dude, look at this guy getting his head chopped off.’ It was cool.”They traded ideas about the most effective or elaborate ways to kill federal agents, particularly from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a bête noire of the far right.Teixeira seems to have grasped that the outside world might not share his sense of humor. While waiting on approval of his security clearance, Crow said he told her that he was particularly concerned that jokes he had made about “shooting up buildings” and “wanting to kill government agents” might surface. She said Teixeira changed his online handle to an innocuous version of his surname and became “less active” in the community for a time, in an effort not to create more incriminating evidence.Defense Department background investigators don’t routinely scrutinize applicants’ social media history, experts said. It’s not clear that Teixeira disclosed his Discord handles or the names of servers he belonged to, but he wouldn’t have been required to do so. The apparent failure to investigate Teixeira’s online activity, and to interview his online friends, meant the Defense Department was effectively blind to a huge part of his life.The summer of 2020 saw protests across the country following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of a White police officer in Minneapolis. In instances where protests turned violent, Teixeira and his friends saw a dark harbinger. In video chats, “people would be in their military gear screaming about it,” Crow said. “There was one day where people joined the call and just started doing push-ups to prepare for the end times. … To them, it was like the police are just letting the Black people do whatever they want.”“We would talk about how much we hated a race, whether that be Jews or Blacks,” Pucki said. “And whether it was serious or not, we didn’t care. It was funny and during such a time where we were so far removed from society. Because of covid, it was so easy to fall into that hole of just hating everything and sort of like a punk.”The group found camaraderie in subversion. “We took joy in being offensive no matter who it was against,” Pucki said. “It was something that made us tighter as friends, like us against the world.”‘This is really what’s going on’The longer Teixeira spent inside the government, the more convinced he was of its venality and corruption. His first foray into sharing classified documents was intelligence about the war in Ukraine.Russia had invaded Ukraine in late February 2022. That month, Teixeira “began to access hundreds of classified documents containing national defense information that had no bearing” on his job as a tech support worker, prosecutors have alleged in court filings.“It just started with the casualty numbers and equipment losses from both sides in the Ukraine-Russia conflict,” Pucki said.“These are the real numbers, guys,” Pucki recalled Teixeira explaining. Calculating Ukrainian losses had been challenging because the government in Kyiv didn’t release official figures. And most experts thought Moscow was releasing lowball estimates in an attempt to conceal the true scale of Russian casualties.“There was misinformation, and he wanted us to know,” Pucki said. “They are really lying, and this is really what’s going on. These are the official U.S. numbers that they’re not telling you.”In the secure facility where he worked at Otis Air National Guard Base, in the 102nd Intelligence Wing, Teixeira had access to the Defense Department’s Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS, where he could read thousands of classified documents on nearly every imaginable topic.Teixeira didn’t limit his queries to facts about the war. Using his top-secret access, he hunted for information to prove his misguided conspiracy theories, searching for keywords about mass shootings in Las Vegas, Buffalo, and Uvalde, Tex., prosecutors allege.Most of the Thug Shaker members took little notice of what Teixeira had brought them; only a few consistently showed a deep interest. He had spent nearly an hour every day writing up intelligence documents verbatim and sometimes adding annotations and explanation, “for stuff that we normal citizens would not understand,” Charles said.Teixeira’s would-be pupils were more interested in watching YouTube videos about military equipment than reading about how it was being used on the battlefield in Ukraine. “He got upset, and he said, ‘If you guys aren’t going to interact with them, I’m going to stop sending them,’” Charles said.But he didn’t stop. Members recall that beginning in the fall of 2022, rather than type the documents by hand, Teixeira began taking pictures of the documents and posting them in the Discord server. Some documents were briefing materials prepared for senior military leaders. They featured detailed charts of battlefield conditions in Ukraine and satellite images of the aftermath of Russian missile strikes. Other documents diagramed the potential trajectory of North Korean ballistic nuclear missiles that could reach the United States. Another featured scenarios that might lead to a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.Some members of the server described his classified disclosures as an act of generosity.“My impression of him was that he did it with no intent to destabilize U.S. allies,” Pucki said. “If he wanted to do that, he would have sent them to Russia or anywhere, North Korea, China. But he didn’t. He sent it in Discord chats because he wanted us to know what was going on.”Thug Shaker had members who didn’t live in the United States, a fact that prosecutors have said put the classified information at greater risk of exposure to a foreign government.According to court documents and online records reviewed by The Post, Teixeira was sharing top-secret intelligence as early as February 2022 on another Discord server with hundreds of active users. Called Abinavski’s Exclusion Zone, it was associated with a YouTube streamer who plays the video game “War Thunder,” known for its realistic models of tanks, fighter jets and other military vehicles.In March 2023, more than a year after Russia had invaded Ukraine, Teixeira thanked his audience on Abinavski who had followed his updates on the war. “I was very happy and willing and enthusiastic to have covered this event for the past year and share with all of you something that not many people get to see something very few people in fact, get to see,” he wrote, according to court filings. He said he had decided to stop his dispatches, but he was willing to field requests for information from the members of the server.“If you guys do you want happenings that pertain to your country or events or politics or whatever you can DM me and I can tell you what I have … so offers on the table,” Teixeira wrote.In July 2021, seven months before he started sharing classified materials with his online friends, Teixeira signed a nondisclosure agreement meant to protect especially sensitive intelligence that he was bound to encounter in his role as a support technician working on classified computer networks, according to court records. He acknowledged that the “unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized retention, or negligent handling” of highly classified information “could cause irreparable injury to the United States or be used to advantage by a foreign nation.”Teixeira’s bosses eventually realized the young airman was nosing around in classified material that had nothing to do with his job.Around July or August of 2022, according to the Air Force inspector general, someone saw Teixeira looking at “intelligence content” on top secret websites. “His supervisor was informed, but the incident was not documented in writing,” according to the inspector general report.On Sept. 15, 2022, a staff sergeant who worked with Teixeira saw him “taking notes on classified intelligence information” and “put the note into his pocket,” according to an official memorandum written the same day and included in court filings. The sergeant asked Teixeira if he planned to shred the paper. (The memo doesn’t indicate how he responded.) Two more senior sergeants discussed the incident with Teixeira, and he was “instructed to no longer take notes in any form on classified intelligence information.”A month later, on Oct. 25, a master sergeant in Teixeira’s squadron learned that he “was potentially ignoring the cease-and-desist order on deep diving into intelligence information” that he had received after the first incident, according to another official memorandum. Teixeira had attended a weekly briefing where he “proceeded to ask very specific questions,” alerting his superiors that he was still reading documents instead of focusing on his role as a support tech. He was instructed to obey the cease-and-desist order.Leaders present for the briefing asked about the classification level of the information Teixeira was citing, the Air Force inspector general found. He replied that the information was classified but was also available via “open sources,” according to the report. “Contrary to his assertion, the information was not believed to be publicly available and [Airman 1st Class] Teixeira’s supervisor was again advised of his suspected intelligence-seeking behavior.”Despite the alarm bells, officials offered Teixeira “the opportunity to explore cross training” as an intelligence analyst, a job in which he would have a valid reason to read classified material. He declined.Then, on Jan. 30, 2023, the same master sergeant who had been informed of Teixeira’s previous infractions “was walking the Ops floor” and saw Teixeira on a machine that accessed JWICS, the top-secret Pentagon computer network, according to a third official memorandum. She could see that Teixeira was looking at “content that was not related to his primary duty and was related to the intelligence field.” The staff sergeant reported the incident to a more senior colleague. The memo doesn’t say if anyone reprimanded Teixeira, who by then had been posting photographs of classified documents to Thug Shaker.Suspicious workplace activity like Teixeira’s is supposed to be reported to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, as part of a policy of continuous vetting meant to ensure people are abiding by their agreements to protect classified information. There is no indication that the incidents or the memos were shared with the agency. Defense officials did not respond to several requests for comment on the matter.Mark Zaid, the security clearance expert, said Teixeira’s behavior bore the hallmarks of “an insider threat concern.”“You have someone looking at classified information that they have no need to know and they’re observed doing it and told not to do it,” Zaid said. “Obviously that’s a problem.”The Air Force inspector general found widespread failures in Teixeira’s unit to follow established security procedures. Three individuals in the unit “who understood their duty to report specific information regarding [Airman 1st Class] Teixeira’s intelligence-seeking and insider threat indicators to security officials, intentionally failed to do so,” the report concluded. The individuals said they worried that if security officials had learned about Teixeira’s behavior they might “overreact.\" But had any one of them come forward, those officials probably would have helped to restrict Teixeira’s access to classified systems and facilities and alerted the appropriate authorities, “reducing the length and depth of the unauthorized and unlawful disclosures by several months,” the inspector general report found.Fifteen members of the Air National Guard, including the commander of the 102nd Intelligence Wing, have been disciplined for failing to take appropriate measures in response to Teixeira’s actions, Air Force officials said.Exactly how Teixeira managed to remove the information from the base remains unclear. The photographed documents show crease marks, indicating that he may have folded and secreted them out of the facility, perhaps in his pocket. Cellphones were banned inside his workspace, called a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF.The inspector general found “a lack of supervision during night shifts,” which Teixeira worked. Members were sometimes left alone for hours. There were also no controls in place to monitor which documents were being printed. “Any night shift member had ample opportunity to access JWICS sites and print a high volume of products without supervision or detection,” according to the inspector general report.One Discord user told The Post Teixeira “would take notes and then use the voice-to-text feature and write them up on his car drive home …” Another said he “took notes in the classified area that he just wrote up on his phone later.” That user said Teixeira talked about getting caught at work “and told off” by a superior. Teixeira said he might stop posting information, the friend said, but in the end he wasn’t chastened by his boss’s reprimand. He seemed more defiant.On Dec. 6, 2022, according to prosecutors, Teixeira wrote on Discord that he was “breaking a ton” of regulations against unauthorized disclosure. But “Idgaf [I don’t give a f---] what they say I can or can’t share.”On Feb. 28, 2023, less than a month after Teixeira’s superior saw him looking at classified information for the third time, a teenage member of Thug Shaker with the online handle “Lucca” began posting several dozen of the photographs of documents on another Discord server affiliated with wow_mao, a popular YouTuber. Five days later, another Discord user posted 10 of them on Minecraft Earth Map, a server devoted to the popular video game.Thug Shaker had sprung a leak. Classified documents soon spread across Discord and, eventually, the broader internet. On April 5, top-secret intelligence assessing the war in Ukraine appeared on Russian Telegram channels and the message board 4chan. One image, showing a March 1 update on the war, had been crudely doctored to inflate the number of Ukrainian casualties and downplay those on the Russian side. Some U.S. officials initially wondered if the document leak was part of a Russian disinformation operation.The next day, the New York Times first reported on the appearance of classified U.S. documents online. On April 7, Aric Toler, then the director of research and training at Bellingcat, reported on the existence of a Discord server where the documents had first been posted. The documents soon spread to Twitter. The leak had gone global, but Teixeira remained unknown and at large.Charles said that Teixeira called the Thug Shaker members in a panic. “He said, ‘I’m sorry guys. I really wish this would never happen. I prayed, and I prayed and I prayed that this day would never come, but now it’s just in God’s hand. I love you all.’ And then that was basically it.”Teixeira began covering his tracks, prosecutors allege. He adopted a new username online and spread the word that his friends should “delete all messages” and not say anything about him to those who might come looking.On April 7, Teixeira deleted Thug Shaker Central from Discord, according to employees at the company. Discord normally does not retain copies of data that users delete, so investigators would have to rely on witness statements and any screenshots or direct messages that members could access.Teixeira continued going to work, but the FBI was closing in. According to investigators, he searched government networks for the word “leak,” perhaps trying to get some insight into the manhunt underway.Investigators found his name and address in Discord’s records. Tracking Teixeira was a relatively easy task. On April 13, federal agents wearing tactical gear approached the family home in North Dighton, where Teixeira lived. Overhead news footage showed him sitting on the porch, wearing red gym shorts, reading a Bible. He did not resist arrest.Investigators would find a tablet, a laptop and an Xbox gaming console in the trash outside the house. All were smashed. FBI agents also found a box for a new iPhone in the garbage. Teixeira told a colleague that his old phone had accidentally flown out of his truck window and was run over by a semitruck, prosecutors say.In the weeks that followed, government officials struggled to understand how broadly the information Teixeira posted had been shared. And they privately acknowledged they didn’t have a complete understanding of how many documents he had copied or photographed.Following the arrest, friends reflected on the extraordinary confluence of circumstances that had led Teixeira to act so recklessly. Many said the dual forces of pandemic isolation and Discord had impaired their judgment, and they wondered if the same was true for Teixeira.“I was spending basically all my time with people on Discord,” Crow said. “I lost my train of thought completely.”The echo chamber of the Discord server, coupled with the isolation of the pandemic, may have fueled Teixeira’s desire to be admired, Crow said. “I don’t think [he] ever would’ve done this unless these exact situations all lined up.”Firearms are shot in the backyard of Jack Teixeira's parent's home. (Video: Obtained by the Washington Post)Those who knew Teixeira first in the real world have been surprised to learn about aspects of his online life.A Post reporter showed LaBree and Brandon Bourgault, a high school friend, a video of Teixeira at a shooting range near his house, which had been shared on Thug Shaker. Dressed in a camouflage hoodie, he curls his finger around the trigger of a semiautomatic rifle, faces the camera and declares, “Jews scam, n-----s rape, and I mag dump.” Teixeira then aims at an unseen target and fires 10 times in rapid succession, emptying the magazine of bullets.Watching the video for the first time, Teixeira’s childhood friends were briefly dumbstruck.Pucki said Teixeira’s case had shined a light on a dark corner of the internet that most people, and parents of teens in particular, didn’t know existed. “You probably could not even put a number on it, the amount of people that have groups like this,” he said of Thug Shaker. “We took joy in being offensive,” Pucki said. “It’s embarrassing and it’s quite frankly humiliating to speak about it now …”“I genuinely don’t think he deserves jail,” said Crow, who hasn’t spoken to Teixeira since their breakup. “I think he was just being stupid. There was never anything malicious about this, in my opinion. I think it was being dumb, trying to be cool.”Following Teixeira’s arrest, Charles endured a months-long absence from the internet, at his mother’s insistence. But he has since gone back on Discord and reconnected with some friends from Thug Shaker. They’ve formed a new server where they discuss Teixeira and his case. Some of the members have become convinced that the government has  little evidence that he leaked classified documents. They think their friend may soon be free.Reflecting on Thug Shaker, Charles said that, absent an adult stopping them, “a lot of young people” are going to find their own way online. “And they’re going to say things that later on they’re going to regret. I’ve said stuff that I regret on that server. Everyone has,” Charles said.“But I don’t regret meeting Jack Teixeira at all. No, he was a great guy.”In the ceaseless company of Discord friends, Charles said, one can lose a sense of real-life consequences. “When you feel anonymous on the internet, you feel like you can say anything and get away with it.”James O’Donnell, Tom Jennings and Annie Wong from “Frontline” and Chris Dehghanpoor, Alex Horton, Dan Lamothe and Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.Skip to end of carouselThe Washington Post interviewed several people who were members of the same Discord servers as Jack Teixeira. They gave accounts of what he said and how he shared classified U.S. intelligence. In some cases, the people provided screenshots or histories of their direct messages with Teixeira. The Post verified the identities of everyone quoted in the articles in this investigation and granted some people limited anonymity — referring to them only by their online handles, for instance — because of the sensitivity of the subject matter. In one case where a member of a Discord server was under age 18, The Post obtained consent from the individual’s parent to conduct interviews.The Washington Post and “Frontline” partnered to investigate Jack Teixeira’s alleged leak of classified U.S. intelligence on the Discord chat platform. The new documentary, “The Discord Leaks,” premiered Tuesday, Dec. 12 and is available to watch on PBS streaming platforms and washingtonpost.com.The suspected document leaker: Teixeira, a young member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was indicted on six charges. Interviews with people who knew Teixeira offer the most detailed account yet of how he allegedly leaked classified information and his motivations. Discord’s rules and culture allowed a racist and antisemitic community to flourish, giving Teixeira an eager audience unlikely to report his alleged lawbreaking.How the leak happened: The Washington Post reported that the individual who leaked the information shared documents with a small circle of online friends on the Discord chat platform. The Air Force disciplined 15 members of the Air National Guard after an internal investigation found that a “lack of supervision” helped enable Teixeira. This is a timeline of how the documents leaked.What we learned from the leaked documents: The massive document leak has exposed a range of U.S. government secrets, including spying on allies, the grim prospects for Ukraine’s war with Russia and the precariousness of Taiwan’s air defenses. It also has ignited diplomatic fires for the White House. Here’s what we’ve learned from the documents.",

  "text": "On Saturday, a week after Hamas militants launched a devastating attack on Israel, Czuba allegedly knocked on the Palestinian family’s door just after 11 a.m. When the mother, Hanaan Shahin, answered, Czuba assaulted her with a serrated military-style knife while yelling anti-Muslim statements, forcing her to run to the bathroom to call 911, according to local authorities and the family’s statements at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nWhen Shahin emerged from the bathroom after calling police, according to the accounts, she found Czuba attacking her 6-year-old son, Wadea Alfayoumi, who later died of his wounds. He had been stabbed 26 times, the Will County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Shahin, 32, was stabbed at least a dozen times and remains hospitalized in serious condition, the family said.\n\nWhen authorities arrived, Czuba was sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration to his forehead, according to the sheriff’s office. He was taken to a hospital for treatment but did not make any statements to detectives when later questioned, the sheriff’s office added.\n\nPresident Biden said in a statement that he was “sickened” to hear of the deadly attack in Illinois, which “stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.”\n\nBefore the service, speakers implored elected officials and members of the news media to employ greater caution, compassion and clarity in the days ahead because their roles are pivotal in fostering an environment that can give way to hate crimes. Speakers demanded an apology from President Biden for claiming to have seen photos of alleged Hamas-driven atrocities that his administration later clarified he had not seen.\n\n“There’s more than just a man that stabbed a 6-year-old boy here,” Imam Omar Suleiman said. “I want you to think about what was in his head. What type of hate has to be manufactured in the head of a man for him to stand over a 6-year-old boy and stab him 26 times?”\n\nThe attack came a week after Hamas militants raided communities in southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people there and injuring more than 3,842, authorities said. Palestinian officials said 2,670 people in Gaza have been killed and 9,600 wounded after Israel began a bombing campaign ahead of an expected ground invasion.\n\nThe brutality of the latest outbreak of warfare has unleashed language from all sides that is so hateful and dehumanizing that it has shocked even longtime observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. International peace activists repeatedly have warned that the ugly rhetoric could inspire violent retaliations in the United States, citing dark precedents such as the targeting of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the increase in antisemitic incidents after previous flare-ups involving Israel.\n\nIn the past few days, Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups have documented vandalism or bomb threats at synagogues and mosques, along with hateful messages and swastikas scrawled in their communities. Arab and Muslim rights groups say they have fielded calls from people reporting that they have been fired or silenced for expressing pro-Palestinian views.\n\nAuthorities gave few details about Czuba. As news of his arrest spread, people who live nearby said in community forums on Facebook that Czuba had long alarmed residents with yard signs telegraphing his “extreme” views. One woman wrote that she had alerted local officials about the “unhinged” man. The Post contacted the woman seeking details but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nThe Palestinian tenants had seen the signs but did not understand their symbolism and had not experienced the landlord’s extremist side until recently, said Yousef Hannon, an uncle and family spokesman who was sitting with the slain child’s father, Odai Alfayoumi, during a phone interview.\n\nWadea was born in the United States to Palestinian parents who moved here more than a decade ago and have since divorced. The extended family, which has roots in both the West Bank and Gaza, already was reeling this week from the perils faced by relatives who are fleeing the Israeli siege and retaliatory strikes that followed the Hamas-led attack. Hannon said they never imagined that the tentacles of war would stretch all the way to the Chicago suburbs.",

  "text": "On April 13, Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was arrested and charged with illegal retention and transmission of national defense information. His arrest came after Pentagon officials learned that highly classified U. S. documents had been popping up in social media channels.The FBI located and arrested Teixeira about a week after the leaks became public knowledge. Teixeira pleaded not guilty to six counts of mishandling and disclosing classified information and remains in jail awaiting trial. He and his lawyer declined to comment.\n\nThe documents Teixeira allegedly disclosed revealed information obtained by nearly every element of the U. S. intelligence community about an astonishing range of topics: the Russia-Ukraine war, China’s development of hypersonic spy drones, North Korea’s nuclear weapons development and conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nIn a small server, populated largely by teenage boys united by a common interest in military gear and warfare, users made racist and antisemitic jokes, peddled gory videos and traded conspiracy theories about government agents. Friends said Teixeira shared the closely guarded secrets hoping to impress the users, who looked up to him as their leader. Teixeira also posted intelligence on another, larger server — but his alleged leaking was never discovered by the company.\n\nThe Post obtained more than 300 of the documents that Teixeira is accused of posting, as well as long text messages he wrote that contained verbatim transcripts of other documents.\n\nNow, new reporting reveals additional details about Teixeira’s possible motivations, the damage his alleged leaks caused to national security and missed opportunities to potentially catch him earlier, which will air in a new documentary, “The Discord Leaks,” produced by The Washington Post and “Frontline.” It is now available to watch on pbs.org/frontline, PBS streaming platforms and washingtonpost.com.\n\nJack Teixeira, born in December 2001, grew up in Dighton, Mass., the child of divorced parents. As a middle-schooler, Teixeira read books on World War II aircraft. His interest in warfare found an outlet in video games, including violent first-person shooter games, where friends said Teixeira displayed an arcane knowledge of weapons and military vehicles.\n\nTeixeira enlisted in the Air National Guard in 2019 and was assigned as a computer technician to an intelligence unit at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Teixeira helped maintain computer networks where top-secret intelligence was stored, but he was not an analyst authorized to read the information he might encounter.\n\nThe Post investigation raised questions about why Teixeira was able to obtain a top-secret security clearance in the first place. He had been suspended from his high school after making violent threats, including against Black people. Local law enforcement officials were concerned enough that they repeatedly denied Teixeira’s request for a firearms permit. Yet the Defense Department’s background check determined that he could be trusted to handle classified information. That process typically doesn’t closely examine the online lives of applicants.\n\nThe Defense Department has declined to answer questions about how Teixeira obtained a top-secret security clearance. Teixeira claimed in a petition for a gun permit that a background investigator was aware of violent threats that he made at his high school and had access to a police report documenting that incident. Experts said that the threats should have raised red flags for the officials who decided to grant him a clearance. A report by the Air Force inspector general found that Teixeira’s unit wasn’t informed about “negative” information turned up in his background check that might have led superiors to monitor him more closely at work.\n\nThe Post is suing the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) for refusing to release information about Teixeira’s security clearance that should be public under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe Air Force inspector general found significant security lapses at the base where Teixeira worked. According to court records, Teixeira’s superiors caught him on three separate occasions looking at intelligence documents that had nothing to do with his job and ordered him in writing to stop “deep diving” into official secrets. Experts said that such infractions should have been reported to the DCSA as part of a continuous vetting process, meant to identify so-called insider threats that pose a risk of disclosing classified information. The Post’s reporting shows there is no indication that the agency was made aware of Teixeira’s infractions.\n\nMany of the documents Teixeira is accused of leaking online focused on the Russia-Ukraine war. The documents showed that U. S. officials knew Ukraine was running desperately low on munitions and taking heavy casualties. Daring sabotage missions inside Russia weren’t shaking the public’s resolve, nor had they deterred President Vladimir Putin from continuing to feed his troops into a veritable meat grinder.\n\nThe disclosures were remarkable for their breadth. And they were of recent vintage, spanning a period from around February to March, offering deep insights on events that were developing by the day.",

  "text": "Over the intervening four decades or so, Trump’s rhetoric hasn’t really changed much. What have changed are the geopolitical realities and Trump’s own ambitions. Now, as he did over the weekend, Trump uses the idea of NATO allies “owing” money to the organization — which none do — as cover for his obvious empathy toward Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\n\n“One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, ‘Well, sir, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?’ ” he claimed during a rally in South Carolina. “I said, ‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’ He said, ‘Yes, let’s say that happened.’ No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.”\n\nIt’s important to point out that this framing is false. It has long been the case that the United States contributes a large chunk of NATO’s resources in money, personnel and equipment. Back in 1987, when Trump was talking to CNN at the tail end of the Cold War, the Congressional Budget Office released a report documenting the difference between the United States and other NATO members. At the time, NATO members were called to spend at least 3 percent of their annual gross domestic product on defense but, the CBO report noted, only the United States had consistently hit that mark.\n\nIn 2006, 15 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the NATO allies set a new target of 2 percent. Five years later, only three countries were hitting the target: the United States, Greece and Britain. By the time Trump had become the Republican Party nominee for the 2016 presidential election — running, in part, on the argument that the United States was getting a raw deal from the alliance — five countries were over the 2 percent mark. In 2022, seven were.\n\nNote that this is not a bill paid by member countries to the alliance. It is, instead, an effort to establish preparedness, to have enough resources that NATO is able to fulfill its mission. To oversimplify, you might think of it like trying to set aside 5 percent of your income to buy Christmas presents. If you fall short, it’s not that you owe yourself money; it’s that you have less than you had hoped.\n\nDefense spending relative to GDP is one of two targets that NATO sets for member nations. The other is that members spend a fifth of their defense budgets on equipment, as opposed to personnel or other line items. On that metric, most members are in compliance. In 2014, only seven member nations were at or over 20 percent; in 2022, nearly all were, thanks to a surge in 2021 and 2022.\n\nSince 2014, NATO members have on average both increased their relative spending on defense and the percentage of that spending that’s on equipment. In 2014, NATO members spent 1.4 percent of their national GDPs on defense; by 2022, the average was 1.7 percent. In 2014, an average of 12.9 percent of defense spending was on equipment, rising to 27.3 percent in 2022.\n\nYou can see the trend below, with averages indicated for every two years and the change from 2014 to 2018 to 2022 indicated for each of the member countries.\n\nThe country that spends the lowest percentage of its GDP on defense is Luxembourg, which in 2022 spent an estimated 0.6 percent of GDP. But Luxembourg — population about 640,000 — spent the most on defense relative to population. Norway was in second and the United States in third.\n\nNotice that Trump’s rhetoric against the United States’ NATO allies has gotten more aggressive despite a broad improvement in the thing that he supposedly finds so offensive about their participation. He says the same thing about NATO he said in 1987, despite changes in membership and changes in how those members participate in the alliance.\n\nSince then, though, Trump’s warmth toward autocrats and Putin in particular has become only more pronounced. When Russia prepared to launch its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump’s immediate response was to praise Putin’s “genius.” After the invasion began, he called the move “smart.” Over the past two years, Trump’s seen much of his party reorient its foreign policy around his worldview: that American support for Ukraine is excessive — or even that the United States shouldn’t side against Russia at all.\n\nWhat Trump says at his campaign rallies are things that he believes his base will enjoy. The line about how NATO doesn’t pay its bills — a negative, dishonest framing — has been used for years as a way to shrug at the United States’ commitment to the alliance. But now, even as members have improved relative to both metrics NATO establishes and even as Russia’s hostile ambitions are much more immediately obvious, Trump takes the rhetoric further. “Let them do whatever they want.”",

  "text": "The Republican Party in the Trump era is defined by attrition. Trump has spent more than eight years gradually and systematically upping the provocations and counting on his allies to lose the will to fight him, which they routinely do. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.Few issues epitomize that like NATO.Trump this weekend offered his most provocative statement to date on the alliance, indicating he would actually “encourage” Russia to attack NATO allies who don’t pony up enough money for defense.\n\n“One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, ‘Well, sir, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?’ ” Trump said at a rally Saturday in South Carolina. “I said, ‘You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent.’ He said, ‘Yes, let’s say that happened.’ No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.”\n\nAnd now Trump not only says he wouldn’t defend countries that don’t pay enough, but that he would actually encourage Russia to go after them.\n\nThe comments have drawn a handful of rebukes from prominent Republicans. But more telling are the shrugs — and even the defenses — they have elicited from a handful of prominent GOP foreign policy hawks and NATO boosters who once objected to this kind of thing.\n\nRepublican hawks once fought back strongly against Trump on NATO — and were actually willing to buck him on foreign policy issues they decided were just that important. But as they have on many issues, they seem to have lost the will to fight their party’s Trumpian drift.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said in 2016 that Trump’s comments had made Russian President Vladimir Putin “a very happy man” and that Trump was “essentially telling the Russians and other bad actors that the United States is not fully committed to supporting the NATO alliance.”\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in 2016 responded to Trump’s comments by saying the United States must abide by Article 5 and urged Americans to “make sure that we stand by NATO and we stand for countries like Ukraine and Georgia [who face] Russian aggression, and recognize Vladimir Putin as the adversary he is.”\n\nOn Sunday, Tillis said Trump should not have said what he did, “but also I don’t believe it’s something that he honestly believes.”\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in 2018 said it was okay to call for other countries to pay. But Trump went too far by “questioning the value of the alliance,” Rubio suggested then. “The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin,” he tweeted at the time.\n\nOn Sunday, Rubio said he had “zero” concerns about Trump’s latest comments and ventured that he didn’t mean them. “We’ve already been through this,” Rubio said. “You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.”\n\nThe overarching thrust of these statements is that Trump is just saying things to put pressure on NATO allies. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) urged people to “take everything that he says seriously, but not literally.”\n\nBut we’ve also seen the peril of assuming Trump doesn’t really mean what he says. And Congress has seemingly taken Trump pretty literally on NATO before, going so far as to pass legislation to guard against his impulses.",

  "text": "White House officials are considering asking Congress for an aid package primarily aimed at supporting Ukraine and Israel that could cost as much as $100 billion, although that preliminary estimate may change as planning remains in flux, according to four people briefed on the matter. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.In conversations with congressional staffers, Biden aides have discussed proposing as soon as this week a major foreign policy package amid numerous international crises, including the war between Hamas and Israel. The legislation is also expected to include substantial funds to bolster U.S. immigration enforcement at the southern border with Mexico, and may include funds for Taiwan to deter aggression from China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations. Money to respond to recent U.S. natural disasters, including wildfires in Maui and various hurricanes, could also be folded into the legislation.\n\nAides stressed that the plans were highly uncertain and subject to change. President Biden previously proposed roughly $20.4 billion in funding for Ukraine, but Congress blocked any additional money for Ukraine when it extended government funding into November.\n\n“It’s going to make a strong statement to our enemies and to our friends,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said about the proposed aid package.\n\nOne person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said the request would cover a full fiscal year for the crises it is intended to address.\n\nDemocratic leaders said they expect to receive the proposal at the end of this week.\n\n“We intend to get the package at the end of this week and it will include the military help Israel needs, the diplomatic and intelligence help Israel needs, as well as humanitarian aid to minimize the loss of innocent human life, of Palestinians and of Israelis,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) told reporters.\n\nThe effort comes as House Republicans struggle to elect a new speaker, which could complicate efforts to pass any bill swiftly. House Republicans have grown increasingly wary of providing taxpayer funds to Kyiv, but may be more likely to do so if a request also includes money for the border and Israel.\n\nBloomberg reported earlier that White House officials were considering a $100 billion request in the aid package. It was unclear how much money would be included for each country.",

  "text": "But this time things are different. Border communities are still reeling from the Hamas-led assault that killed 1,400 Israelis, and now amid the trauma, there is an unwillingness to return to the status quo.\n\n“We want to make these terrorist attacks stop,” said Maor Ben Haim, 34, as he loaded his six-months-pregnant wife and children onto an evacuation bus  over the weekend. “That’s it. We were too patient, too gentle. I think the nation is now united to do what  should have been done a long time ago.”\n\nIsrael has said it is ready to crush Hamas, and residents here are shipping out as Gaza braces for the force of an all-out assault. Like other communities along the 40-mile fence with Israel, the streets of Sderot now lie largely empty save for security forces, volunteers and the smattering of residents  who have decided to stay. Nine out of  10 people in the working-class southern city of 30,000 people have left.\n\nIn recent days, much of Sderot and its surroundings has been declared a closed security zone as the military prepares staging grounds on the border. New concrete road blocks have been installed to stop traffic as artillery blasts out shells into Gaza.\n\nFrom an overlook in the city, beyond the supposedly impenetrable border fence that Hamas made light work of in  the Oct. 7 assault, the Gazan cities of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia stretch out below. Black plumes rise from the sky as shells from Israeli tanks hit their mark, with the sound of explosions occasionally punctuated by the rattle of machine gun fire.\n\nAn Arabic speaker after having grown up in Morocco before emigrating to Israel, she has fond memories of visiting Gaza to eat fish and attend weddings before the 40-mile-long separation fence was constructed to pen off the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut now she’d like to see it erased. “If I could, I’d go kill them all,” she said, letting out an “oy, oy, oy” at the boom of outgoing artillery at the end of a temporary humanitarian cease-fire.\n\nShe’s the first call of the day for Malka Stein, a nurse from Rescuers Without Borders, who had traveled from northern Israel to volunteer. But now she thinks she may be needed more at home, as the Israeli government moved to evacuate 28 communities close to the Lebanese border, amid fears of a broader conflagration with Hezbollah.\n\nAs a second group waited for a ride out, a rocket flashed across the sky and people rushed toward the school shelter, reminding some of their reasons for leaving. About 74 rockets have made direct hits on homes here over the past week.\n\nBut for some, the decision is harder than others. Yossi and Shmurit Edrich’s baby was born on Oct. 6, just hours before Hamas’s incursion into their town. Premature and weighing just over 4 pounds, the baby has to stay in the hospital for a week.\n\nThe city has emptied out before, but people are expecting a longer haul this time, said Ayelet Shmuel, director of the city’s resilience center. “The city knows how to run,” she said. “But this time we don’t know what’s going to happen.”\n\n“Now we are going for our revenge,” said Capt. Nadav Mizrahi, a reserve officer deployed with a tank brigade. “To destroy everything from top to bottom,” he said. “I’m sure we can do it. It will take time and cost lives. But it’s our country. We will do anything.”",

  "text": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.",

  "text": "Biden will also visit Jordan, where he plans to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has endured Israeli airstrikes that have killed more than 2,700 Palestinians.\n\nHamas has taken scores of hostages into Gaza, including an unknown number of Americans. Biden will work to get as much information about the hostage situation as possible during his trip, White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing with reporters Monday evening.\n\nKirby emphasized that the United States had not sought assurances that Israel would not launch its ground invasion while Biden was visiting the country. “We’re not dictating terms or operational directions to the Israelis,” Kirby said. “We don’t want to see escalation. We want to make sure humanitarian assistance begins to flow.”\n\nStill, U. S. officials waited to announce Biden’s travel to Israel on Monday night until they received commitments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a humanitarian package, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken received assurances during a marathon meeting in Tel Aviv this week and then made the announcement that Biden would be visiting.\n\nDuring the 7½-hour meeting, Israeli and U. S. officials set up separate rooms and passed papers between the two sides, negotiating over humanitarian issues including getting aid into Gaza and creating safe zones for Palestinian civilians, said a State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.\n\nThough Blinken hailed an agreement on humanitarian issues, his announcement included few details, probably an indication that differences remain between the two allies. The provision of humanitarian aid is sensitive in Israel, especially among far-right politicians tied to Netanyahu who have pressed him to wage a scorched-earth campaign in Gaza in response to the terrorist attack.\n\nThe White House is deeply concerned about the conflict spiraling into a broader regional conflagration, and Biden has warned other actors, particularly Iran, not to jump in. His visit to Israel could underline that message.\n\nOfficials are also worried that anger in Arab countries, where many citizens have deep sympathy for the Palestinian cause, could boil over and create pressure for their leaders to take action against Israel.\n\nBiden has repeatedly emphasized his support for Israel and said the country has a duty to respond to the horrific attack, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas breached Israel’s sophisticated border fence in several places before hunting civilians in their homes and cars and shooting people indiscriminately.\n\nBut the president and his top aides have also sought to draw a distinction between Hamas and Palestinian civilians. In recent days, they have stressed their efforts to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow into Gaza and to secure a humanitarian corridor where Palestinian Americans can leave the densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children.\n\nIsrael has said its goal is to eliminate Hamas and has urged more than 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza to avoid being in harm’s way, an order the United Nations called impossible. It also announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, fuel, electricity and water, which human rights groups have said violates international law.\n\nBiden spoke with Sisi on Monday, the White House said, and the two discussed “ongoing efforts to alleviate the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the U. N., Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and other regional partners.”\n\nEgypt has helped broker cease-fires between Israel and Palestine during past incursions and plays a critical role in ongoing efforts to secure humanitarian assistance. And on Egypt’s border with Gaza, the Rafah crossing could be the only way out for Palestinians seeking to flee the enclave amid Israel’s bombardment campaign.\n\nBlinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave.\n\nBut there was confusion over the agreement and the crossing remained closed, deepening frustration and panic among aid groups, who warn that time is running out for wounded and displaced Gazans to receive critical — and, in many cases, lifesaving — supplies.\n\nThe planned trip to Israel is in some ways reminiscent of Biden’s visit in February to Kyiv, as he was seeking to dramatically show his support for Ukraine. That trip, too, was aimed at showcasing Biden’s personal support for an ally that had suffered a bloody attack, in Ukraine’s case at the hands of Russia. That visit was kept secret until Biden’s arrival.",

  "text": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces’ most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “every Hamas fighter” will be “destroyed,” while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n“I think they’re going to go back in, heavy, and it’s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,” said Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be “dragged out over a much longer period of time” than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities — including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people — have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would “end” the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be “impossible” for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an “integrated and coordinated attack” by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel’s offensive is “obviously going to be much larger” now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be “exponentially greater” than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in “dog fights” between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has “become very efficient” at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces’ advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas’s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn’t sustainable.\n\n“They didn’t want to go into Gaza again. They didn’t want to occupy it. They didn’t want to be responsible for administrating it,” Misztal said. “But now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?”\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel “at this time” — but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power.",

  "text": "Democrats have been almost entirely unified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas hunted civilians in their homes and cars, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages, including some Americans, into Gaza. The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.\n\nBiden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel’s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians. On Sunday he named a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, and the White House has begun emphasizing its work to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow through Gaza and that Palestinian civilians can flee areas Israel is targeting.\n\nThis is not the first time Biden’s ironclad support of Israel has put him at odds with the more liberal wing of his party, as Democrats have grown increasingly willing to challenge Israel as its government has become more right-wing. Some Democrats have raised concerns or outright opposition to U. S. military support to Israel, pointing to its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank and its years-long punishing blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also formed the most far-right government in Israel’s history, though that has been replaced since the attacks by a unity government that includes centrist parties.\n\nBiden has said Israel has a duty to respond to the attacks, which he has called as consequential as the Holocaust, but he seemed to impose limits when he said during a television interview airing Sunday that Israel reoccupying Gaza would be “a big mistake.” Israel captured the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war, but it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, leading to a Hamas takeover of the territory two years later.\n\nA White House summary of Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U. S. coordination with the United Nations, as well as Egypt, Jordan, Israel and other countries to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. “President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,” the readout said.\n\nBiden and his top aides are focused on preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflagration and have repeatedly warned other actors, such as Iran, not to get involved. They are also concerned that anger in Arab countries whose citizens are highly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause could set off such a conflict, according to a senior administration official, who  spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.\n\n“They know an Israeli ground incursion that has really high casualties could inflame not just the situation among Palestinians but in the broader region,” said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. “There’s a genuine concern that the threat of Hamas needs to be eliminated … but at the same time, how do you make sure that innocent Palestinians aren’t targeted?”\n\n“J Street adamantly rejects the charge that it threatened endorsees,” said the organization’s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. “Over the past 10 days, we’ve spoken to many members of Congress to explain why support for Israel, condemnation of Hamas and recognition of Israel’s right to defend itself are core values of the organization. We want those we support to hear how important it is to us that our partners stand up for Israel even as we also speak out on the crisis now facing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”\n\nThe conflict has inflamed tensions in more direct ways as well. Capitol Police last week had a meeting with nine progressive Democrats, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush, about their safety. A Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said the lawmakers are receiving significantly more threats than they have in the past. The meeting was put together by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N. Y.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.).",

  "text": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael’s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel’s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt — on the conditions they are limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” and do not reach Hamas.",

  "text": "The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City — where authorities suspect an airstrike killed hundreds of people Tuesday — is owned and operated by a branch of the Anglican Communion, one of the largest Christian groups in the world. The 80-bed hospital normally sees about 3,500 outpatient visits a month, according to the website of the Diocese of Jerusalem, the local branch of the Anglican Communion that runs al-Ahli. It handles about 300 surgeries and roughly 600 radiological visits a month.\n\nEileen Spencer, head of the American fundraising arm for the diocese, told The Washington Post that after the strike Tuesday, “we don’t know if the hospital will still be standing.”\n\nAl-Ahli is Gaza’s only independent, Christian-led medical facility, Spencer said. “I don’t understand what the point of all this is. There are so many casualties, and it seems like it is just going to get worse.”\n\nTuesday had been a day of fasting and prayer for peace in the Holy Land, called for by Pope Francis, the Anglican Communion and other Christian denominations. After the hospital strike, the Diocese of Jerusalem called for a day of mourning Wednesday.\n\nIn a written statement, the diocese said, “The devastation witnessed, coupled with the sacrilegious targeting of the church, strikes at the very core of human decency. We assert unequivocally that this is deserving international condemnation and retribution. An urgent appeal resonates for the international community to fulfil its duty in protecting civilians and ensuring that such inhumane horrific acts are not replicated.”\n\nThe hospital was founded in 1882, according to the Jerusalem diocese’s website. It runs a free program for breast cancer detection and provides free medical care and food to people in nearby towns and villages.\n\nOn Oct. 8, in the hours after the Hamas attack on Israel, the hospital launched a fundraising appeal, saying it was urgent to get medicine and other supplies for emergencies that the staff predicted would come.\n\n“The situation is severely critical, and the consequences for people in Gaza are very bad, particularly in the health sector. The Ministry of Health has triggered an emergency situation and asked all health-service providers to increase their emergency response capacity. Life in Gaza is paralyzed, with all institutions and private sectors closed, affecting the people’s access to basic needs, particularly health,” hospital director Suhaila Tarazi wrote in the appeal. “AAH is committed to continuing to provide 24/7 health services for all people in need of medical care.”\n\nAn Israeli rocket hit al-Ahli on Saturday, according to the Anglican Communion’s news service. It landed on the cancer treatment center, severely damaging two floors where the ultrasound and mammography wards are. Four hospital staff were injured.\n\n“The Diagnostic Centre is the Crown Jewel of Ahli Hospital, providing cancer diagnosis as a prelude to various treatment options both at Ahli and in other facilities,” the Anglican archbishop of Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum, said in a story about the Saturday strike. The hospital was due to open a new chemotherapy center there next month, Naoum said.\n\nHundreds are believed dead after what Palestinian officials say was an Israeli airstrike Tuesday on the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter. The Israel Defense Forces blamed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying “a barrage of rockets” was passing near the hospital when it was hit.\n\nViolence and protests broke out in many Arab cities following the hospital strike, and within hours, Jordan’s foreign minister said his country would not host a summit that had been planned for Wednesday with President Biden, Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n“We grieve at the continuing loss of innocent lives. The latest news from Gaza is distressing and comes on top of what has been an appalling 10 days for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” Gavin Drake wrote to The Post. “At the moment, we are monitoring the situation closely and continuing to gather information in this fast moving situation.”\n\nPresiding Bishop Michael Curry, leader of the Episcopal Church, which is the U. S. branch of the Anglican Communion, said in a statement Tuesday that he had visited the hospital in 2018 and saw how “they were passionately committed to anyone who had need.”\n\n“I ask you to pray fervently for the birthplace of the Abrahamic faiths and for all its people. Pray for those who have been hurt, harmed, or killed — regardless of who they are or who did it,” he continued. “Pray also for the leaders and people of the entire region, that they will find the way to a just peace where all may live in safety and security as God intends.”",

  "text": "Biden announced that a deal had been struck with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to flow from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million people face relentless airstrikes and an Israeli siege. Supplies of food, drinking water and fuel are dwindling by the hour. Despite the apparent breakthrough, Biden said the aid would not start arriving until Friday at the earliest.\n\nConcerned that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a broader regional conflict, the White House has tried to assure Arab partners that it will use its influence to protect innocent Gazans. Conditions in the enclave — already one of the poorest and most densely populated places in the world — are deteriorating rapidly. More than 3,000 people have been killed by airstrikes. Local hospitals are collapsing.\n\nBiden spent a little over seven hours in Israel, where he was greeted on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two men — whose decades-long relationship has been tested this year — shared a brief hug. Biden spent more than two hours at a meeting of the Israeli war cabinet before speaking with survivors of the attacks and families of victims and hostages.\n\nNetanyahu emphasized Wednesday that Israel would not permit the transfer of any humanitarian aid to Gaza from its own territory, but said it would not thwart the delivery of supplies from Egypt, provided it was limited to “food, water and medicine for the civilian population” — and so long as none of it reached Hamas.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday called on residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the town of al-Mawasi, the latest in a series of recent directives urging Gazans to move south, even though most have nowhere to stay. The United Nations has warned that the evacuation orders may violate international law.\n\nThere was little acknowledgment in the region of Israel’s denial of responsibility for the hospital strike, or of Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalizing ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”",

  "text": "Anticipating a wave of defaults, however, the SBA had already decided that it would not take the most aggressive actions possible to pursue borrowers who received loans worth $100,000 or less. The agency said it planned to send out stern letters demanding payments and threatening penalties, and it aimed to prohibit these borrowers from obtaining federal aid again. But the SBA opted against referring all unpaid and delinquent loans to the Treasury Department, which can garnish wages and initiate other collection activities, according to reports, letters and other materials prepared by SBA and its top watchdog that were later reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nExplaining the decision, SBA leaders said that the government at the time would be unlikely to recover most of the money anyway. They indicated they had few options because of decisions made under the Trump administration that limited debt collection, making the work to claw back money so costly that it would negate any potential federal savings.\n\nThe fear about compounding losses also prompted Republicans in Congress to demand the agency turn over documents in connection with its management of EIDL as well as another pandemic initiative, the Paycheck Protection Program, known as PPP. House Small Business Committee Chairman Roger Williams (R-Tex.) and 13 other House Republicans warned in a letter Wednesday that, if the SBA does not turn over some of the records, his panel would “evaluate the use of compulsory process” — a subtle threat to obtain the materials by subpoena.\n\nIn a statement, Han Nguyen, an agency spokesman, said that “borrowers need to repay their loans, and the agency will continue its collection efforts against all those who do not.” He added the EIDL program, in particular, uses the “most comprehensive set of legal and cost-effective tools to vigorously pursue repayment of loans, particularly those with legitimate fraud indicators.”\n\nOtherwise, Nguyen said, federal law allows the SBA to refrain from referring unpaid debts to the Treasury Department, since doing so could cost the government too much in staff, administrative hearings and mailings, while potentially harming mom-and-pop small businesses more than larger firms, which may be incorporated and benefit from other legal protections.\n\nThe new scrutiny underscored the growing discomfort in Washington over the SBA’s management of roughly $1 trillion in loans and grants during the pandemic. The troubles stemmed from the earliest days of the public health crisis, when the agency under President Donald Trump opted for haste over precision — rescuing millions of businesses in ways that ultimately exposed taxpayers to unprecedented waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n“There was a real need to get the money out the door quickly,” said Liz Hempowicz, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog. “When it came to this balance between speed and accuracy, I think we miscalculated and put too much emphasis on getting money out the door quickly.”\n\nIn recent months, federal watchdogs have grown newly concerned that the government could lose even more money if businesses don’t repay what they owe. Some of the delinquencies may reflect actual hardship; in other cases, aid recipients may be dodging debts, or their failure to pay back federal loans could suggest they obtained the money fraudulently. Nonetheless, the overall losses to taxpayers threaten to reach into the billions of dollars, compounding the government’s fiscal troubles as the deficit rises and interest rates soar.\n\nUnder federal law, the SBA is supposed to take every action possible to recover late payments, refer the matter to the Treasury Department or, alternatively, determine if the debts can’t be collected at all. To that end, the agency last April took the latter approach, finding that it would be financially unreasonable to pursue unpaid EIDL loans of $100,000 or less. The directive, which SBA Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman did not announce publicly, mirrored a similar policy the agency applied that same year to PPP, a roughly $800 billion program that primarily issued loans that the government mostly forgave.\n\nIn data later furnished to its top watchdog, the SBA estimated in May that there were 1.3 million EIDL loans that were past due, in liquidation or charged off at the time. That added up to more than $33 billion, with some borrowers as late as 120 days on their bills. But the agency did not provide any additional information, nor did it provide monthly spending reports to the inspector general as requested — prompting federal investigators to conclude last month that they could not rely on SBA’s accounting.\n\nAt one point, the SBA did consider alternative approaches, even hiring a contractor, unnamed in the inspector general report, to help assess its outstanding EIDL loans. The unpublished study, conducted in May 2021, included a recommendation that the agency sell off a portion of its debt to “ensure an exit strategy that would maximize the value of the portfolio,” potentially preventing the government from losing more money. But the SBA opted against such a sale as recently as February 2022, declining to say why.\n\nIn another September report, though, the agency’s watchdog found further cause for concern, writing that the SBA failed for five years to submit timely loan data to Experian, one of the monitoring agencies that lenders consult when making a decision about a borrower. At least a dozen times in 2019 and 2020, Experian tried to reach SBA and alert them to the problem to no avail — leaving Experian no choice but to exclude the federal records from its commercial credit files.",

  "text": "These and other incidents have rattled Jewish communities on campuses across America as they mourn victims of the Oct. 7 massacres and kidnappings. For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state. But the outbreak of war has elevated those tensions even further in recent days and raised new alarms about intimidation and antisemitism on campus.\n\nColleges and universities usually take pride in hosting demonstrations and debate, as long as no one gets hurt. Fiery rhetoric is tolerated and often encouraged as students and faculty members engage on politics, the climate, the economy, racism and war. But Jewish leaders say that too often debates over the Middle East take a problematic turn, leading to a threatening atmosphere for Jewish students. For them, that phenomenon is not new.\n\n“The campus climate for Jewish students has been degrading over several years, and that has been aggravated by broader increases in antisemitism and virulent demonization of Israel on campuses,” Adam Lehman, president and chief executive of the Jewish organization Hillel International, said in an interview. Lehman said the climate in recent days has worsened.\n\nAfter the surprise Hamas attack that left more than 1,400 people dead in Israel and thousands more wounded, the Georgia Tech chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi hung a banner from a balcony that declared solidarity with Israel. On Saturday, its members found the pro-Palestinian message written in shaving cream underneath the banner. The message was washed off, but it left a deeper impression: Their home, the fraternity members felt, had been violated.\n\n“We are deeply saddened by the defacing of our property that was committed last weekend,” the chapter said in a statement. “As a Jewish fraternity, we have all been deeply affected by the current events in Israel, and we are profoundly disheartened to see that this conflict has allowed antisemitism to gain a foothold on our campus. With our fellow Jews under attack in Israel, we feel that it is important to visibly display our support for the Israeli people as Jewish leaders at Georgia Tech.”\n\nAt Stanford, the Jewish news organization the Forward reported last week, an instructor had asked Jewish and Israeli students in a class to identify themselves, take their belongings and stand in a corner. The apparent point of the exercise, according to the article, was to show students how the instructor believed Israel treats the Palestinians.\n\nUniversity leaders acknowledged in an Oct. 11 statement that they had received a report of a class in which an instructor “addressed the Middle East conflict in a manner that called out individual students in class based on their backgrounds and identities.” Stanford President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez said the instructor, who was not identified, “is not currently teaching” while the university in California investigates. “Without prejudging the matter, this report is a cause for serious concern,” they wrote.\n\nAt Tufts University in Massachusetts, Micah Gritz, 21, a senior from Rockville, Md., who is a leader in a group called Jewish on Campus, said he was horrified to read an email in which a campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine used paraglider emojis to advertise a rally in nearby Cambridge. The email also praised “liberation fighters” — an allusion to Hamas militants — who had used paragliders in the cross-border attack and showed “creativity necessary to take back stolen land.”\n\nCornell was roiled after an associate professor of history, Russell Rickford, spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in Ithaca, N. Y. The Cornell Daily Sun, a student newspaper, and others published video of his remarks. In the speech, Rickford cited “many Gazans of goodwill, many Palestinians of conscience, who abhor violence — as do you, as do I.” But he also said many who support the Palestinian cause had strong feelings after learning of the Oct. 7 attack.\n\n“It was exhilarating,” he said. “It was energizing. And if they weren’t exhilarated by this challenge to the monopoly of violence, by this shifting of the balance of power, then they would not be human. I was exhilarated.”\n\nBut he told the Cornell Daily Sun that he believed the Hamas attack signaled that “the Palestinian will to resist had not been broken.” He acknowledged that in subsequent days, “we learned of some of the horrifying realities.”\n\nMartha E. Pollack, Cornell’s president, and Kraig H. Kayser, chairman of the university’s board of trustees, rebuked Rickford in a statement Tuesday and said the university was reviewing the matter. Faculty members at universities, especially those with tenure protections, are often given significant leeway in matters of free speech and academic freedom.",

  "text": "The Palestinian boy who had been knifed to death on Saturday was 6 — the same age as her son — so Fidaa Elaydi imposed a new rule: No more playing outside. She used to feel safe in Bridgeview, a Chicago suburb full of Middle Eastern eateries and Muslim clothing boutiques that was known as Little Palestine. Then the Palestinian militant group Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.\n\nIn the 10 days since the rampage by Hamas fighters and Israel’s full-scale counterstrike targeting the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, a spate of headlines has validated her fears. In Boston, somebody spray-painted “Nazis” on a sign for a Palestinian cultural center. In Dearborn, Mich., police arrested a man who allegedly urged his Facebook friends to “hunt Palestinians.” And barely 25 miles from Elaydi’s house, a landlord is accused of stabbing his tenants, gravely wounding the mother and killing her son, with authorities linking his assault “to them being Muslims and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.”\n\nPalestinians in the United States, half a world away from the carnage in the Middle East, say they are canceling dinners out, taking time off work and staying home. Some are getting ominous emails and messages on social media. Others say the environment seems so charged, they’re afraid to openly express concern for loved ones trapped in Gaza as Israel pushes to eradicate the militants responsible for the Oct. 7 massacre of soldiers and civilians.\n\nAnguish for family members in Gaza only heightened the anxiety after a strike Tuesday set a hospital ablaze. Palestinian and Israeli officials traded blame for the attack. The only certainty: Hundreds may have been killed, adding to the death toll of about 3,000 Palestinians.\n\nThose who argue for a Palestinian state, a decades-old cause, say they are being framed as cheerleading “Hamas’s genocidal war,” as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) phrased it in a letter to the Justice Department. Hawley called for an investigation of student groups organizing pro-Palestinian rallies.\n\nThe bloodshed overseas is sowing panic in communities across the country, with the FBI saying it is tracking a spike in threats against both Muslim and Jewish Americans. The agency warned that bad actors could “exploit the conflict” and provoke violence “on our own soil.” Mosques and synagogues have beefed up security. Some private Jewish day schools shuttered last week after a former Hamas leader called for a “day of jihad.”\n\nHundreds of Arab Americans gathered at a mosque in Bridgeview on Monday for the funeral of the 6-year-old boy, Wadea Alfayoumi, who had been stabbed 26 times, the sheriff’s office said. Outside, speakers called on lawmakers to address the conflict with context and nuance. Some demanded an apology from President Biden, whom they accused of inflaming tensions with his comment about seeing photos of Hamas fighters beheading children — a claim the White House later walked back.\n\nOne attended a pro-Palestinian rally on campus last week where strangers started filming the students, Othman said, and she advised her to not engage with anyone who seemed hostile. She doesn’t want her daughters to limit their freedom of speech, though.\n\nRanda Mohammad, a student-support coordinator at a middle school in Dearborn, is following the news with a growing sense of dread. Five of her relatives — her sister-in-law’s cousins — were killed in Gaza while trying to help civilians who had been ordered to evacuate, she said. When videos of the hospital attack reached her phone, she hid in the garage so her children wouldn’t see her cry.\n\nMore than half of Dearborn’s residents are Arab American. Familial ties to Gaza and the West Bank run deep. People love to snack on flaky, cheese-layered kunafa at the beloved Palestinian bakery. And, Mohammad said, everyone is on edge.\n\nThe police presence outside her school has been heavier than normal, she noted; officers arrested a 41-year-old man last week who had posted on social media about hunting Palestinians. On Monday, a 12-year-old student came to her with a question.\n\nThe Arab American Political Action Committee canceled a banquet scheduled for Wednesday in Dearborn, accusing American leaders of endorsing bloodshed by not “doing the bare minimum of calling for a cease fire.” The organizers also harbored security concerns, according to Osama Siblani, a Lebanese journalist on the board of directors. Palestinians as a group, he said, are too often portrayed as the enemy.",

The proceedings in Washington centered on what lawmakers overwhelmingly agreed is Israel’s need for a steadfast American ally in the wake of this month’s devastating Hamas attack, though many Republicans signaled it would be difficult for them to support Lew given his past work to implement the now-defunct deal with Israel’s sworn enemy.\n\nOther Republicans on the committee, including Sens. Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) and Mitt Romney (Utah) suggested that the relaxation of sanctions under the nuclear deal allowed Tehran to more seriously fund militant groups such as Hamas. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) accused Lew of misleading the committee in his past testimony and alleged that the Obama administration sought to provide Iran access to U. S. banks.\n\n“We negotiated with Iran to have them roll back their nuclear program, in exchange for which they would get access to money that was their money that we had frozen. All we did was facilitate that transaction,” he said. “My team went around the world, telling banks: ‘... We did not lift the sanctions on terrorism. We did not lift the sanctions on human rights violations. We did not lift the sanctions on regional destabilization. Be careful.’ And Iran thought that kept them from getting what they thought they should get.”\n\nThe landmark nuclear deal restricted Iran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the loosening of U. S. sanctions. Obama argued then that the agreement was intended to set back any effort by Tehran to build nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement after taking office, and Iran has since exceeded the deal’s limits on the quantity and quality of its enriched uranium production.\n\nAt the time of the 2015 negotiations, Lew defended the deal publicly to pro-Israel audiences in the United States, where he was once heckled. And because the Treasury Department is charged with implementing sanctions policies, he presided over the loosening of restrictions on Iran. The deal unlocked foreign investment in Iran and eased financing for the government. Backers encouraged that investment as part of ensuring that the agreement functioned as it was envisioned.\n\n“I think it’s important to distinguish between the technical details to facilitate implementation of the [Iran nuclear agreement] and more broadly welcoming Iran into the U. S. financial community. We didn’t. And I took no actions that would do that,” Lew said in response to Rubio’s assertions. The senator’s account, he added, was at odds with “my memory of what I had people out there doing.”\n\nLew, 68, who even before his term as treasury secretary served in the top echelon of the Obama and Clinton presidencies, is an unusually senior appointment for the role. He was Obama’s chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role he also filled for President Bill Clinton, when the federal government last ran a budget surplus. Under Obama, he was also a deputy secretary of state.\n\nWhile several Democrats raised concerns during the hearing about the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where a humanitarian crisis is rapidly unfolding as Israeli forces wage a ferocious response to the Hamas attack, Republicans asked whether Lew was sufficiently supportive of Israel and if he shared their desire for a more hawkish approach to Middle East peace.\n\n“This is not the time for us to be lecturing Israel on what they have to do to establish the security that they have a responsibility to provide,” Lew said. “I think they know they have to do it in a way that is consistent with minimizing the impact on innocent civilians,” he added. But previous U. S. wars have demonstrated that “it is very, very hard for there not to be collateral damage.”\n\n“We’re all aware that Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who went on to ask, “Will you, if you are confirmed, work with Israel to make sure that schools and hospitals and power and water systems are not targeted?”\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), broached the spread of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying the seizure of “more and more Palestinian lands” was potentially undermining efforts to broker peace and, in turn, strengthening Hamas. He asked Lew whether the Biden administration’s pursuit of a deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia would need some “attention paid to the Palestinian issues” if it is to succeed.\n\nNow is “probably not the right time” to address whether Palestinian grievances should be a part of any deal between the Israelis and Saudis, Lew responded. “But after this war is over, it has to be part of the conversation.”",

  "text": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden’s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country’s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza’s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael’s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n“We all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,” Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. “They go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid.",

  "text": "Palestinian authorities said at least 500 people were killed in a strike on a crowded hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, adding a dramatic escalation to a death toll that already stood above 2,000 since Israeli forces began pounding the densely populated area with airstrikes following Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault. As many as 1 million people were ordered to flee south as bombardment reduces much of northern Gaza to rubble and conditions deteriorate following Israel’s suspension of water and electricity to the Hamas-ruled enclave, posing an additional test for Biden as he flies to the Middle East.\n\nBiden, in a statement issued as he travels to Israel, said he was “outraged” by the hospital explosion. The United States, he said, “stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict.” In turn, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas canceled his planned meeting with Biden, and a summit that was to include Biden and the leaders of Egypt and Jordan also was called off.\n\nBiden himself, a longtime supporter of Israel who has issued an emotional condemnation of Hamas’s “act of sheer evil,” has pledged unqualified support for Israel’s goal of obliterating the group. But the president and his aides, facing pressure from within the Democratic Party to curb the violence, also are warning Israel against reoccupying Gaza and saying they expect Israel to adhere to the laws of war.\n\n“You have an administration that has made very public commitments to improve how it addresses civilian harm, including with partners,” said Annie Shiel, U. S. advocacy director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “And if the U.S. isn’t going to be firm with Israel about civilian harm and its obligations, then those commitments seem like they go out the window.”\n\nLegal experts said that expanding U. S. military support for Israel meanwhile carries with it weighty considerations for the United States as reported Palestinian casualties mount. Already the administration has positioned two aircraft carriers in the eastern Mediterranean, dispatched an amphibious task force to the area, and expedited shipments of munitions and air defense missiles. How Israel employs U.S.-origin weapons, experts said, may now have new implications for the United States.\n\nBrian Finucane, who served as a State Department attorney during the Obama administration, said the considerations include domestic laws governing arms sales specifying that U. S. weapons can be sold to other countries for the goal of “legitimate self-defense” and international laws that could, in theory, implicate a donor of military aid to a nation that then goes on to violate the laws of war with those arms.\n\nDespite a bargaining session between Blinken and Israel’s war cabinet that went for more than seven hours from Monday evening into the early hours of Tuesday morning, the two sides were only able to agree “to develop a plan” that will include the “possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm’s way,” Blinken said after emerging from the meeting.",

  "text": "Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) faces a possible third House vote Thursday on his speakership bid after falling well short of a majority on Tuesday and Wednesday. Jordan came in second to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) in an initial vote last week by the House Republican Conference to nominate a speaker to replace Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was ousted two weeks ago. Scalise, however, quickly withdrew his bid after Republicans didn’t coalesce around his nomination.\n\nNow Jordan, who secured the nomination for speaker in another round of votes by the conference on Friday, faces the same challenge: how to bring a divided conference together and get nearly all Republicans on board with his candidacy to prevail on the House floor.\n\nThe firebrand conservative from Ohio has garnered a key endorsement from former president Donald Trump. But that was not enough to persuade enough of his GOP colleagues to vote for him on Tuesday’s first ballot or Wednesday’s second ballot.\n\nJordan has risen in the ranks of the Republican conference since first being elected to Congress in 2006.\n\nHe previously served as chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative House members. He also has been the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee since 2020 — fighting off investigations into Trump and launching investigations of President Biden since becoming chairman of the committee this year.\n\n“He is STRONG on Crime, Borders, our Military/Vets, & 2nd Amendment,” Trump wrote. “He will be a GREAT Speaker of the House.”\n\nJordan, 59, has a reputation as a political flamethrower — lobbing attacks against Democrats and being unafraid to disagree with his party’s leadership. He was one of eight House members who served on Trump’s defense team during his first impeachment trial in the Senate. Before he left office, Trump awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.\n\nJordan has had a hand in high-profile investigations of Democrats. As a leader of the House hearings on the deadly 2012 terrorist attack on U. S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya, he questioned then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He is now one of the leaders of the impeachment inquiry into Biden.\n\nHe encountered controversy in 2018 when former Ohio State University wrestlers accused him of knowing about the alleged sexual abuse of wrestlers decades ago and failing to act. Jordan, who was an assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1987 to 1995, denied knowing about the allegations against Richard Strauss, a former doctor in the school’s athletic department.\n\nJordan has been considered for House speaker before: In January, hard-right Republicans who opposed McCarthy nominated him.",

  "text": "The most magical of seasons ended for the Chiefs on Sunday with a second consecutive Super Bowl victory, their third in five seasons. They have an all-world quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, who may be the greatest to ever play the most glamorous position in sports. On the CBS telecast, analyst Tony Romo called him Michael Jordan after he tossed the game-winning touchdown pass in overtime to beat the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22.\n\nBut it’s Kelce, the 34-year-old tight end with a luxuriant beard, who makes the Chiefs the closest thing this century to Jordan’s Bulls. It’s Kelce who makes the Chiefs a cultural phenomenon, who somehow made the NFL feel even bigger thanks to his budding romance with Taylor Swift.\n\nKelce delivered a strong Super Bowl performance. He had nine catches for 93 yards, including a key reception on the game-tying drive at the end of regulation, and he played a key decoy role on the game-winning pass to Mecole Hardman. After the game, as confetti fell, he led the crowd in one of his favorite songs: “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).”\n\nAll of it, though, was a prologue — at least for most Americans — to the championship-sealing kiss between Kelce and Swift on the Allegiant Stadium field, the two stars surrounded by hordes of cameras. “That woman is damn near in tears,” Nate Burleson said on the CBS broadcast. “Travis is emotional. That’s real love. That’s what you can get when you have the support of a woman behind you.”\n\nThe scene was the culmination of a season that catapulted Kelce to A-list levels of fame. He appeared in more commercials during NFL games than any other player. He hosted “Saturday Night Live.” His podcast took off. His brother became a meme. Thanks to Swift’s presence, more young girls tuned in to watch NFL games. Her Super Bowl attendance was a matter of interest for the Japanese embassy.\n\nAs teams across all sports preach the value of limiting distractions, this title was validation of the Chiefs’ embrace of all the diversions, a cardinal sin in most locker rooms.\n\n“More attention is more fun,” Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton said. Added Chiefs owner Clark Hunt: “You could never dream of the impact that their relationship would have on the Chiefs. We do have a whole new fan base now of predominantly young women who weren’t watching NFL games before. But now they make Chiefs games appointment viewing.”\n\nIt was almost a different sort of night for Kelce. In the first quarter, he was on the bench when running back Isiah Pacheco fumbled. Kelce angrily confronted Andy Reid on the sideline, nearly knocking his 65-year-old coach to the ground.\n\n“I was just telling him how much I love him,” Kelce said after the game. What could have been a key storyline had the Chiefs lost became barely a footnote. A charmed life, indeed.\n\nThe night before the game, the Chiefs had gathered for a meeting. Kelce stood and addressed the team. After the win, player after player cited the speech as a key moment in preparation. “Whatever Travis was saying, I need to bottle that up and sell it,” safety Justin Reid said. “That was just ultimate juice, ultimate passion. You felt that throughout the room. He touched everybody that was in that room that heard his voice.”\n\nA year ago, after Kansas City’s victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, Kelce said it had been the greatest year of his life. This season surely must have topped it. “Just when you think things couldn’t get any better,” he said before disappearing into the bowels of the stadium. Videos on social media later circulated of his and Swift’s arrival at the Chiefs’ after-party at a Las Vegas hotel. Kelce wore the glittering black suit that had hung in his locker.",

  "text": "Adding to the risks of Biden’s trip was a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that killed at least 500 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter, while the Israel Defense Forces blamed an errant rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying “a barrage of rockets” was passing near the hospital when it was hit.\n\nThe hospital blast has set off fierce protests in the Middle East, including in Jordan, where the Israeli Embassy was surrounded by protesters Tuesday evening. A planned visit by Biden to Amman on Wednesday was canceled after the strike, forcing the U. S. president to forgo a scheduled meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nSome security experts said the physical risk to Biden would be relatively small despite the chaos in the region. Biden is one of the most protected people on the planet, they said, and Air Force One is equipped with sophisticated air defense systems that can thwart incoming rockets and missiles.\n\nStill, it’s a rarity for a president to travel directly into a region where hostilities are intensifying, with an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza expected within days and fears that the militant group Hezbollah might enter the fray. Biden faces at least some risk when he is on the ground in Tel Aviv, a city Hamas rockets are able to reach. In Amman, which Biden had planned to visit after his stop in Tel Aviv, the situation remains combustible.\n\n“Being in an active area of hostilities, they have to look very carefully at the threats that Israel is facing now, understanding that the president will be on the ground,” said Jonathan Lord, senior fellow and director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security. “So they’re definitely thinking about Israel’s air defense capabilities and protecting the president from Hamas rockets.”\n\nThe crisis erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants broke through Israel’s sophisticated border fence with Gaza and hunted Israeli civilians in their cars and homes, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages into Gaza, including some Americans. Tensions have only grown since then as the brutality and scope of Hamas’s attacks have become clearer and as Israel has launched repeated deadly airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nBiden’s visit comes as Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion that it says is an effort to destroy Hamas, potentially setting off one of the worst conflicts in the region in decades. U. S. officials are deeply concerned that the war could spread and draw in such actors as Hezbollah or Iran.\n\nGaza is a densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. Even without a formal occupation, Israel controls almost all aspects of life in the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, water, electricity and fuel — tactics that human rights groups have said violate international law.\n\nThe country has also unleashed an unrelenting bombardment campaign and warned more than 1 million Palestinians to flee northern Gaza to avoid being in harm’s way, an order that the United Nations called impossible. Biden and his top aides have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors so that Palestinian civilians can flee and aid can get into the Palestinian territory.\n\nExperts said Biden’s trip to Kyiv this year was in some ways more dangerous than the Israel trip because Russia has a far more sophisticated military than Hamas. Although Hamas is arguably a far more unpredictable entity, its militants are unlikely to have the technology or prowess to launch a targeted attack against an American president.\n\n“The risk to the president himself is probably pretty minimal. He is surrounded by Secret Service and the Israelis will provide additional protection layers,” Riedel said. He added that Biden flying in and out of the Middle East in one day, rather than staying in an easily identifiable location overnight, further minimizes the risks.",

  "text": "In a statement, Gallagher, 39, invoked the framers of the Constitution who “intended citizens to serve in Congress for a season and then return to their private lives.”\n\n“Electoral politics was never supposed to be a career and, trust me, Congress is no place to grow old,” said Gallagher, who has advocated for term limits in Congress. “And so, with a heavy heart, I have decided not to run for reelection.”\n\nGallagher’s departure gives Republicans just months to join the race before the state’s primaries. Alex Bruesewitz, a Trump ally with ties to Gallagher’s safely Republican district, had expressed a desire to run against Gallagher after his vote on Mayorkas. Roger Roth, a former Wisconsin state senator, announced Saturday evening that he intends to run for the seat.\n\nGallagher, a former Marine Corps intelligence officer who deployed twice to Iraq, had served as the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on cyber, information technologies and innovation and on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the youngest chair of a select committee in the modern era, according to his office.\n\nThe Green Bay Republican has established himself as one of Capitol Hill’s top national security and foreign policy hawks. He was generally viewed as a moderate member of his conference, and a rising star. Gallagher’s decision is the latest in a spate of House retirements in both parties, but especially among Republicans.\n\n“Eight years ago, when I first ran for Congress, I promised to treat my time in office as a high-intensity deployment,” Gallagher said in a statement. “We’ve accomplished more on this deployment than I could have ever imagined.”\n\nAlong with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Gallagher called for banning TikTok in the United States and had traveled to Taiwan, returning to urge his fellow lawmakers to arm the island robustly in the face of a potential Chinese invasion.\n\nGallagher, who declined a request to be interviewed, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he plans to enter the private sector and spend more time with his young family, which he hoped to expand. He told the news outlet that his future work will focus on defense policy, in line with his long-standing national security goals.\n\nGallagher earlier had not telegraphed how he would vote on Mayorkas’s impeachment; after he voted no, he was swarmed on the House floor by his colleagues, who engaged in an apparent last-ditch attempt to change his mind.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — who has tried multiple times to force the House to expedite impeaching Mayorkas — was seen shouting at Gallagher, alongside Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.), who spearheaded the investigation into Mayorkas. Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Tex.), a close ally of Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), then animatedly tried to persuade Gallagher to flip his vote as Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S. D.) listened in, The Washington Post reported.\n\nGallagher told the Journal Sentinel that his decision to leave Congress had nothing to do with his controversial vote on Mayorkas, and that he was stepping away for personal reasons and because he never saw the position as a long-term appointment. He joined the House in 2017.\n\nDuring his time in office, Gallagher has occasionally broken with former president Donald Trump, as he did when he called the former president to call off his supporters as they stormed the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He was critical of the insurrection, but ultimately voted against impeaching Trump.",

  "text": "But the widely watched conservative pundit wasn’t only using his televised bully pulpit to pressure the holdouts. Hannity also spent the weekend personally calling several and having one of his producers reach out to others to lobby them on their vote. He also took to social media to encourage his followers to call wavering members and demand they fall into line.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, when Jordan lost an initial vote of the full House, it was unclear whether the turbulent series of events would end with a congressman long relegated to the hard-right fringe elevated to lead the chamber. But the overall picture of the legislative branch in chaos — and the allure of the media spotlight helping to drive the dysfunction — was well-established.\n\nThen House Republicans’ original preferred replacement — Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) — had to withdraw from contention after failing to consolidate the support of hard-right members and the media figures who back them. Now Hannity and others are leaning on Jordan’s critics to get behind the Ohio congressman, who has long been a favorite of Fox News and other conservative outlets.\n\nThe campaign by Hannity to boost Jordan, who has also been endorsed for the speaker’s job by former president Donald Trump, began soon after Scalise withdrew from the race. On Friday afternoon, Hannity tweeted that “Any Member of Congress would be crazy to NOT support Jim Jordan for Speaker. He is a natural born principled leader who will lead house Republicans to unite vs the radical left.” Hannity went on to provide the switchboard number for the House of Representatives, and urged his followers to “call your member and tell them.”\n\nOver the weekend, Hannity reached out to several holdout lawmakers who were not supporting Jordan, while one of his producers contacted lawmakers with an email asking why they weren’t backing him. The producer’s email, which was first reported by Axios and has been confirmed by The Washington Post, included a leading question: “Hannity would like to know why during a war breaking out between Israel and Hamas, with a war in Ukraine, with the wide open borders, with a budget that’s unfinished why would Rep xxx be against Rep Jim Jordan for speaker?”\n\nBut in a measure of the limits of those kinds of pressure tactics, Womack on Tuesday was among the 20 Republicans who declined to support Jordan in the floor vote. Womack, who voted for Scalise instead, said the GOP’s initial nominee had been “kneecapped” before he could get his own vote before the full House.\n\nSome members have been unusually outspoken in blasting their colleagues for playing to the cameras. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) tweeted last week that his fellow members were making decisions based on “egos and TV time.” McCarthy, meanwhile, was unequivocal in identifying what he saw as the reasons Gaetz had moved against him. “It had nothing to do about spending,” he told reporters shortly after his ouster. “It all was about getting attention from you.”\n\nIn the case of the speaker fight, the consequence has been a string of firsts that hint at the underlying chaos: the first 15-round speaker election in nearly two centuries when McCarthy was chosen in January; the first ouster of a speaker by a vote of the House when he was deposed this month; and the first vacancy in over half a century to last two weeks or more.\n\nPrevious Republican speakers have had tortured tenures as they have attempted to govern in the face of factions trying to wield outsize power by leveraging their influence on the airwaves. For instance, unlike McCarthy, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) wasn’t voted out of office. But he did step aside under pressure in 2015 after the Freedom Caucus, led in part by Jordan and backed by Fox, made the Republican conference ungovernable.\n\nBut once in power, McCarthy had to make deals with Democrats to keep the government functioning. The cycle eventually caught up with him, as it is likely to do with anyone in his position, even a Fox News regular like Jordan, Stirewalt said.\n\n“Jim Jordan used Fox News and the right-of-center media to great effect over the past decade to force his way into the conference, to force his way into leadership and create all these pressure points,” Stirewalt said. “So after this long struggle, you hear people saying, ‘We have to stop here. The revolution has to stop here.’ But I don’t see why anyone feels like they have to go along now and behave themselves.”",

  "text": "Mahomes’s three-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mecole Hardman with three seconds remaining in overtime won it for the Chiefs. The 49ers had taken a 22-19 lead on rookie kicker Jake Moody’s 27-yard field goal on the opening possession of overtime. But the Chiefs moved down the field on the second possession of overtime and reached the end zone for only the second time in the game.\n\nWith pop music superstar Taylor Swift cheering from a stadium suite in support of her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce, the Chiefs won the Super Bowl for the third time in the past five seasons. Mahomes, at 28, further cemented his standing among the NFL’s all-time quarterbacking greats, and Reid added to his coaching legacy before facing questions about whether he will seize this opportunity to retire at the peak of his profession.\n\nThe Chiefs left no doubt that they have joined the procession of NFL dynasties. They played in the Super Bowl for the fourth time in five seasons. They have been to six straight AFC championship games. They have replaced the New England Patriots of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick as the sport’s standard of unyielding excellence. They became the NFL’s first repeat Super Bowl champions since the Patriots did so in the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\n“I know you get fatigued of a team sometimes and one team winning,\" said Mahomes, who was named the game’s MVP. \"But we try to enjoy it, just enjoy the moments that we have together and enjoy just kind of what we can do every single day to bring the best [out in] each other.”\n\nReid turns 66 next month. He faced retirement questions at this Super Bowl, one year after saying in the aftermath of last season’s Super Bowl victory over the Philadelphia Eagles that he would not retire then. But it would be difficult to walk away from this. As long as the Chiefs have Mahomes at quarterback, it seems no one ever should wager against them. Reid said after the game that he intends to coach on.\n\nThis season brought a bumpier ride than usual for the Chiefs. Mahomes was not in the thick of the league MVP conversation. He and Reid allowed their frustration to show when the NFL disciplined them for their conduct toward game officials. Kelce battled injuries. There were glaring deficiencies at wide receiver. The Chiefs were the AFC’s No. 3 playoff seed and had to go on the road for the postseason.\n\nThe Chiefs hit their stride with road victories over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round of the playoffs and over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC championship game. They remained on a roll Sunday by defeating the 49ers in the Super Bowl, just as they beat the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV four years earlier in Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\nThis Super Bowl underscored the 49ers’ inability to reconnect fully with their glorious past. They have gone without a Super Bowl victory since the 1994 season. It is becoming a legacy of exasperating near misses for Coach Kyle Shanahan and his team, with four appearances in the past five NFC championship games but no Lombardi Trophies to show for it. They have lost two Super Bowls and two NFC championship games over that span.\n\nThis 49ers team benefited from the stunning transformation of quarterback Brock Purdy from being the final player chosen in the 2022 NFL draft to being a Pro Bowl selection and MVP contender this season. Tailback Christian McCaffrey was the NFL’s offensive player of the year. The roster was about as talented as it gets, particularly on offense with left tackle Trent Williams, tight end George Kittle and wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk.\n\nThe 49ers had the upper hand early. They outgained the Chiefs 125-16 in the opening quarter. But it was scoreless because of the Niners’ mistakes. McCaffrey lost a fumble on their opening possession, and Williams committed false start and holding penalties on consecutive plays to stall their second drive. They broke through on a 55-yard field goal by Moody in the opening minute of the second quarter.\n\nThe Chiefs, after punting on their first two possessions, had a scoring opportunity on their third drive, thanks to a 52-yard completion from Mahomes to Hardman. But tailback Isiah Pacheco lost a fumble on a first-and-goal run from the San Francisco 9-yard line. The Chiefs were getting nothing done on offense, and Kelce had a first-half sideline outburst in which he bumped into Reid while venting his frustration.\n\nThe 49ers upped their lead to 10-0 with a gadget-play touchdown by McCaffrey. On a second-and-10 play from the Kansas City 21-yard line, Purdy threw a backward pass to his left to wide receiver Jauan Jennings. The wideout threw the ball back across the field to McCaffrey, who wove his way into the end zone. The Chiefs finally broke through with Butker’s 28-yard field goal 20 seconds before halftime.\n\nMahomes threw an interception to 49ers safety Ji’Ayir Brown on the third snap of the second half. The Chiefs failed on a third-and-one run and then punted on their next possession. But Butker’s 57-yard field goal on their next drive got them within 10-6. The 49ers muffed a punt later in the quarter. The Chiefs recovered and on the following play, Mahomes zipped a 16-yard touchdown pass to Valdes-Scantling.\n\nThe 49ers responded with Purdy’s 10-yard touchdown pass to Jennings early in the fourth quarter, soon after a fourth-and-three conversion from the Kansas City 15-yard line. The Chiefs blocked the extra point. Butker’s 24-yard field goal tied the game at 16 with 5:46 to play in regulation. Moody connected from 53 yards with 1:53 remaining. But a 22-yard completion from Mahomes to Kelce set up Butker’s tying 29-yarder with three seconds left in regulation.",

  "text": "According to a top-secret U. S. intelligence document, however, a massive attack by Hezbollah, the political party and militant group backed by Iran, would be unlikely. As of early this year, U.S. intelligence analysts saw a predictable if still violent balance between Israel and Hezbollah diminishing the risk of a full-scale war in 2023.\n\nAccording to an analysis prepared in February by the intelligence directorate for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Israel and Hezbollah had settled into a posture of “mutual deterrence” since the conclusion of a historic agreement, in October 2022, in which Lebanon and Israel agreed to demarcate their contested maritime borders. The deal, 11 years in the making, signified a breakthrough and allowed each country to finally explore the lucrative gas fields off their coasts.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah had taken steps to “maintain readiness” to use force, but had remained “within their historical patterns of engagement,” which meant avoiding casualties and responding to provocations in a proportional way, according to the U. S. briefing document, which The Washington Post obtained exclusively after it was shared on the chat platform Discord.\n\nHezbollah is Lebanon’s strongest armed group and political party. Along with its allies, it held the majority in parliament until elections in 2022 when it fell short a few seats. The coalition still maintained the largest number of seats in parliament.\n\nAs Lebanon falls deeper into an economic crisis, and in the absence of state institutions and benefits, Hezbollah has attempted to buttress its position as an alternative patron for much of the country’s historically marginalized Shiite community.\n\n“Even during periods of heightened tensions,” Israel and Hezbollah had intended “to display strength while avoiding escalation,” according to the U. S. analysis. For example, the document explains, Israel might carry out sabotage operations in Lebanon or fire on empty land, while Hezbollah shoots down an Israeli drone or fires rockets into the northern part of the country. The actions are provocative, but they are designed to avoid casualties. Each side can demonstrate to the other that they’re on guard and capable of striking without igniting a wider outbreak of hostilities.\n\nIn April, 34 rockets were launched from southern Lebanon into Israel, an attack that the Israeli military said was carried out by Hamas operatives, whose leaders had met with the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, a day earlier in Lebanon. For months, the U. S. analysis noted, “Israel perceived a high risk of miscalculation due to Lebanon-based HAMAS plots.” Essentially, while Hezbollah might not be courting a war with Israel, that outcome was not entirely within its control, the U.S. intelligence suggested.\n\nThe State Department estimates that Hezbollah claims tens of thousands of members and supporters worldwide and receives hundreds of millions of dollars in annual support from Iran. Experts have described Hezbollah as the world’s most heavily armed non-state actor. According to public Israeli sources, Hezbollah has expanded its arsenal of rockets and missiles from around 15,000 in 2006 to 130,000 in 2021. Nasrallah has claimed the group commands 100,000 fighters.\n\n“I think a lot of people made assumptions about how deterred Hamas and Hezbollah are,” said Matthew Levitt, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. While he broadly agreed with the U. S. intelligence assessment, Levitt said that Hezbollah was now more likely to take advantage of the war in the south, which has consumed much of the Israeli military’s attention.\n\n“I do see [Hezbollah] gradually trying to change the rules of the game,” Levitt said. Both sides have exchanged artillery and rocket fire since the Hamas attack Saturday. Israel has deployed reservist troops to towns along the border with Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah leaders’ rhetoric has already begun to shift. In the first speech by a Hezbollah official after the Hamas attack, Hashem Safieddine declared the group is “not neutral in this battle.” Hezbollah’s fighters “had given their salute to Gaza in Shebaa Farms in their own, special way,” he said, referencing the strikes Hezbollah launched into a contested region on the border between the two countries on Sunday.\n\nBut, as the U. S. intelligence analysis warned, such provocations carry their own risks of escalation, especially if Hezbollah conducts what it intends to be limited strikes that end up killing Israeli forces or civilians.",

  "text": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider and more devastating Middle East war are growing as clashes with Iranian-backed Hezbollah intensify along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Israel presses ahead with its plans for a ground incursion into Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas. The fears spiked on Tuesday following a strike on a Gaza hospital that appears to have killed hundreds of people, triggering angry denunciations and calls for vengeance across the region. Demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank, marched to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and converged on Israeli diplomatic missions in Turkey and Jordan, blaming the strike on Israel, which has denied responsibility.\n\nThe bloodshed fueled already rising tensions between Israel and Iran, which backs Hamas along with an array of allied militias and proxies. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned before the strike that Iran’s militia allies in the “resistance front” could take what he called “preemptive action” to deter an Israeli ground offensive, and the risk is high that an incident such as this could prompt escalatory attacks in revenge. “We have to retaliate from Lebanon,” the demonstrators chanted in Beirut.\n\nOver the past decade, Iran has built up a formidable array of militias and proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in addition to Hamas, and all or any of them could be called on to open up new fronts. Iran also has to calculate whether it can afford to expend the considerable military leverage it derives from these allies in a potentially ruinous conflict for the purpose of defending one of them, Hamas, in Gaza.\n\nWashington has positioned two aircraft carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah, and could also be drawn into the fight if Hezbollah launches a full-scale assault on Israel. Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah forces there, would almost certainly join in; there have already been exchanges of fire along the Syrian border, and activists report that Iranian-allied fighters have been relocating to southern Syria from the east of the country.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, is the well-armed, battle-trained and highly disciplined Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, said Michael Horowitz, director of intelligence at Le Beck security consultancy. Hezbollah has amassed between 130,000 and 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, some of which could reach deep into Israeli cities or be used to deliver precision strikes against Israeli military facilities such as air bases, curtailing Israel’s fighting capabilities.\n\nBut Israel probably would also inflict massive damage on Lebanon, as it did in the 2006 war and the 1982 invasion of the country. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon that “the price you will pay will be far heavier” than in any previous war.\n\nIt appears the Iranians do not want an escalation and are keen to find ways to avoid one, according to a regional diplomat familiar with some of the Iranian conversations with that nation’s allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. While making it clear that their allies are prepared to fight, Iran and Hezbollah have not publicly set red lines for what scenario in Gaza would trigger their involvement — which could range from continued attacks on Gaza, the launch of a ground invasion or only in the event that Hamas is at risk of being completely defeated, the diplomat said.\n\nA senior Hamas official, speaking from Beirut, insisted that Iran was not involved in the Hamas assault, in which at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed and nearly 200 taken hostage. He said Hamas had not anticipated the scale and speed of the collapse of Israel’s defenses and that Hamas was caught off guard also by the ferocity of Israel’s response; over 3,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli airstrikes, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\n“Of course the Iranians help us and train us and give us support, but this operation specifically was very confidential and secret,” said Ali Barakah, who heads Hamas’s international relations department. He described what he said was intended as a “limited operation” to trade Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners and said the expectation was that Israel would conduct limited airstrikes against Gaza before embarking on negotiations.\n\nBuilt up over decades since the creation of Hezbollah in 1982, the strategy aims to position enough militia firepower on Israel’s borders to deter an Israeli attack on Iran, a long-standing fear that has grown in recent years as Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. The Palestinian cause is central to the strategy and to Iran’s identity as a revolutionary Islamic state.\n\nOver the past two years, Iran has sought to reinforce the strategy with a concept known as “unity of fronts,” under which Hezbollah, Hamas and other regional allies have pledged closer cooperation and mutual defense, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah and Hamas have set up a joint coordination center in Beirut with a view to collaborating in ways that further deter Israel from attacks on any one of them.\n\nIran almost certainly doesn’t want to risk undermining Hezbollah’s deterrent capabilities for the sake of Gaza, but at the same time it can’t afford to be seen as abandoning its allies if the deterrence is to survive, Knights said.",

  "text": "BEIRUT — Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel’s denial of responsibility, or Biden’s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia — which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel — immediately condemned what it said was a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.” Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country’s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached — or were considering — deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. “Where is the Arab army?” university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to “end all forms of normalization and cooperation” with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel’s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n“Of course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,” he added. For that to change, “the Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn’t them, and I don’t think they can do that.”\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments — such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 — indicated Israel’s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the “Israel attack” on the hospital and called for an “immediate cease-fire” — a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man — apparently involved in the aid effort — yells at the camera: “If there is bombing, I’ll go in. If there is death, I’ll go in. I came here determined to go in.”\n\nAn accumulation of grievances — over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel’s hard-right government — seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza — barred by Israel and Egypt — Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, “in real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,” she said.",

  "text": "The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re’im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.\n\nAt least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.\n\nThe attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. “The event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,” ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.\n\nThe festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.\n\nBen Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. “I took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,” she said. “The people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.”\n\nThey drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.\n\nOn Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.\n\nArgamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. “If she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn’t have gone, but we knew nothing,” Marciano said. “She wasn’t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, ‘Go; you’re young.’ I regret that.”\n\nIn the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, “Allahu akbar!” A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair.",

  "text": "But increasingly, the president and his team have also made fairly gentle appeals for Israeli caution. Over the weekend, Biden delivered a warning amid questions of what an Israeli victory over Hamas might look like, what the Jewish state’s endgame could be as it pounds Gaza Strip rubble into gravel and sets in motion what experts expect to be an unprecedented ground war in Gaza.\n\nAsked whether he disagrees with Israel’s decision to cut off food, electricity and water to Gaza in a policy of “complete siege,” Biden said “I'm confident that there's gonna be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water.”\n\n“One of the things that we learned is that you have to really think through next steps,” he told Nick Schifrin. “You have to be very thoughtful about that because they will have long-term implications. Don’t operate on reflex activity. Think through what you’re going to do, what implications it’s going to have for the country, for the region, and beyond.”\n\n“Russia has agreed to free four Ukrainian children — ranging in age from 2 to 17 — and allow them to return them to their families in Ukraine after Qatar intervened as a mediator, according to a government official briefed on the matter. Two of the children are now back with relatives and two others are expected to be reunited with their families in the coming days, the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations, said,” Siobhán O’Grady reports.\n\n“With less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses, the 2024 presidential candidates were required to file their third-quarter fundraising reports by midnight Sunday. Former president Donald Trump reported a huge cash advantage over his Republican rivals at the end of September, a haul bolstered by his pleas to his donors to aid his effort as he is set to face multiple legal trials next year,” Maeve Reston, Clara Ence Morse and Hannah Knowles report.\n\n“Now the fates of the two issues may be linked in coming weeks on Capitol Hill, as the Biden administration weighs combining aid for those two countries, as well as funding for Taiwan and the U. S. border, into one complicated package that a still-to-be-named new House speaker would have to shepherd,” the Wall Street Journal’s Sabrina Siddiqui and John McCormick report.\n\n“Fred Daibes, the New Jersey real estate tycoon at the center of an international scandal threatening the career of Senator Robert Menendez, has found his way out of more than one tough spot over the course of his tumultuous life,” the New York Times’s Elise Young and Tracey Tully report.\n\n“Biden’s administration sold off more than 40 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last year to help limit rising fuel prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, leaving the stockpile at its lowest levels since the early 1980s. That’s fueling Republican accusations that Biden has left the U. S. vulnerable to a disruption of global oil supplies — at a time when Hamas’ terrorist attacks in Israel are stoking fears of a wider regional war disrupting fuel shipments from the Middle East,” Politico’s Ben Lefebvre reports.",

  "text": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet when the country’s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington’s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n“If we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,” said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. “It fell in the sand,” he said. “If it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.”\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration’s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East — essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation’s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza.",

  "text": "“Immediately, as we woke up to the news on Saturday, we talked to law enforcement,” said Meredith Weisel, the regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the D. C. area. “We have requested that they continue to increase patrols of Jewish institutions.”\n\nAntisemitic incidents in the United States reached historic levels in 2022 — the highest since the ADL began collecting data in 1979, according to its  audit. (Disturbingly, I wrote a similar line when the Jewish Community Center in Fairfax County was covered in 19 swastikas overnight in 2018. The number of acts is exponentially growing.)\n\nAnd against that backdrop — a domestic hostility that has steadily increased year after year — the massacre in Israel feels palpable and even foreboding here in America, where hatred of Jews is very real.\n\nWhile American Jews like her who remember the 1973 Yom Kippur War may have felt an existential threat when Israel was attacked back then, it wasn’t as personal and immediately menacing as the Hamas attack today.\n\n“I don’t know, I just grew up in a part of Chicago where most people got along,” she said. “There were signs at restaurants and country clubs that said ‘Members Only,’ and we knew that meant ‘No Jews.’ But swastikas? It wasn’t like that.”\n\nFor one thing, there was no information highway to spread the hate so quickly back then. Already, monitors at the ADL are seeing an uptick in hate speech and threats online, Weisel said. The group’s website has resources for people who want to help.\n\n“We are definitely worried that here in the U. S. and here in our region,” she said, “when something happens in Israel, we see it repeated here.”\n\n“I am a runner; I happened to be out running early in the morning,” she said, and she saw swastikas and “KKK” scrawled all over the place where her family worships in Gaithersburg, Md., the Shaare Torah synagogue. “It stopped me dead in my tracks. It was horrible. This is a place that my kids call a second home. They went to preschool there.”\n\nThose are the images that come to mind as her family hears the news from Israel and as the incidents across the nation grow, at the same time books about the Holocaust — among them “Night” by Elie Wiesel, “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank and “Maus,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel by Art Spiegelman — are being banned from school libraries.\n\nJust days after that massacre, D. C. police arrested a man who said he supported that attack. Jeffrey “Raph” Clark, a guy born in D.C. who went to liberal, local schools, had a basement full of nooses, ammo, armored vests and a sketch of someone with a gun aimed at the head of a bearded man wearing a yarmulke.\n\nClark alarmed his family when he defended the synagogue massacre. On Gab, he called the shooter a hero and said, of those killed, that “every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,” according to court documents. (Clark was sentenced to time served after serving almost 10 months for a federal gun charge.)\n\nAccording to a spreadsheet showing hate incidents in Montgomery County in March, kids have found swastikas scrawled on desks, drawers, doors, tables and chairs. A child found one on a piece of paper stuffed into his backpack. There was a tiny one on the edge of a Jenga block. Many in bathrooms. This was just one month.\n\nHe knows there are kids who have family members and friends in Israel who are unaccounted for. He’s hoping the schools will be proactive in helping these students with counseling and messaging, for both Jewish and Muslim students who may be within the emotional blast radius of events happening far from home.",

  "text": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden’s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country’s worst crisis in decades.\n\nIn response to the Hamas attack, Israel has throttled Gaza, a 25-mile-long enclave under Hamas control that is home to 2 million people, sealing it off from aid deliveries and cutting off electricity amid blistering airstrikes and an expected ground incursion. The effect has been what a U. N. agency has called a “bone-chilling” humanitarian crisis that has turned the densely populated and besieged enclave into a “hellhole.”\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza’s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael’s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n“We all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,” Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. “They go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid.",

  "text": "Palestinian fighters breached the Gaza border in at least five places on Saturday in the deadliest incursion into Israel in decades, and appeared to catch Israeli soldiers by surprise in dawn assaults on fortified installations, according to videos verified by The Washington Post. The videos, released by Hamas on social media, showed militants using explosives and other means to breach Israel’s border fence with Gaza, then driving and jogging, sometimes for several miles, to attack weakly guarded military posts and towns, where they killed and captured Israeli soldiers and civilians.\n\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the assault, which began while Israel was observing a religious holiday that falls the day after the festival of Sukkot. The groups also launched more than 3,000 rockets, the Israel Defense Forces said. At least 700 people in Israel were killed and thousands wounded, Israeli media said on Sunday.\n\nSkip to end of carouselPresident Biden said the U. S. would not support a major Israeli military operation in Rafah without a credible plan for civilian safety. At least 67 Palestinians were killed during strikes Monday in Rafah that the Israeli military described as providing cover for the rescue of two hostages.For context: Understand what’s behind the Israel-Gaza war.The videos verified by The Post showed scores of fighters breaching the border with little opposition, armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. They poured into Israel on the ground, flew in with fan-driven paragliders and used commercial drones to attack Israeli military targets, including tanks and communications infrastructure.One video shows fighters from Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, using explosives against a section of border wall near the Erez crossing, the only one available for Gazans to travel into Israel, located at the northern end of the Gaza Strip. The video shows at least seven gunmen running toward the crossing, moving through a security checkpoint and firing at a guard tower.\n\nIn the video, a fighter shoots a bloodied body on the ground in a hallway as he catches up with a group of other militants, who appear to be capturing two men clothed in only shorts and T-shirts. Later in the video, as the fighters clear hallways and living quarters, several other bodies can be seen on the ground. It was not clear from their clothing if they were in the military.\n\nAnother video filmed at sunrise shows fighters on foot and motorcycles passing through an opening made in the border fence near Kerem Shalom, a kibbutz on Israel’s southern border with Egypt near a major border crossing of the same name. The video then cuts to the fighters storming a military outpost about three miles to the north.\n\nSkip to end of carouselHow we verify videos of the Israel-Gaza warThe Post only publishes verified videos of the Israel-Gaza war. Verification takes rigorous reporting, fact-checking and collaboration to make sure a video hasn’t been manipulated, either through missing context, deceptive editing or malicious transformation. Here’s how we do it:1. We geolocate the video by cross-referencing distinctive landmarks in the footage with reliable source material such as satellite imagery or Google Earth.2. We translate any dialogue in the video to see if there are context clues.3. We investigate when the video was recorded, using metadata, time stamps and the position of the sun. Other visuals, official statements, eyewitness testimony and audio also provide context that help corroborate videos.3. We review the uploader’s account and try to find the original source for the video.4. We consult with military experts when weapons and military equipment may be clues about what transpired.5. We screen for fake videos by examining whether there are jump cuts, interrupted audio, or visuals and audio that doesn’t match.6. We run a reverse-image search and look for other posts on the same topic to make sure it is not an old video — perhaps even from a different conflict — that is recirculating.Once the fighters reached Be’eri, nearly three miles from the Gaza border, other videos, including one posted on X (formerly Twitter) showed them dragging at least five people away. Two appear to be older and thinly dressed, and all are barefoot, with their hands tied behind them.\n\nIsraeli and Hamas officials both confirmed that Israeli military personnel and civilians were taken captive across southern Israel during the assault, though the total number and their condition is unknown. A spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing said there were “tens” of soldiers and officers in the group’s custody, a Reuters journalist in Gaza reported. The Israeli Embassy in the United States posted on X that there were 100 “kidnapped civilians and soldiers.”\n\nIn Nahal Oz, less than a mile from where fighters breached the border fence, they stormed a military base and used a commercial drone to drop an explosive on Israeli soldiers standing near an ambulance. The videos from the base showed fighters taking female prisoners.\n\nPalestinian fighters also managed to reach Sderot, a town of about 30,000 people roughly three miles from the Erez crossing in north Gaza. Images from Sderot showed more than a half-dozen civilians bloodied and slumped around a bus stop in the city, and videos showed armed men in a pickup truck firing at an Israeli police vehicle.\n\nThe Saturday assault took place under the cover of a large rocket barrage that began at about 6:30 a.m. and was aimed at cities across Israel. The Post verified footage taken in the aftermath of several reported strikes, including in Tel Aviv and the southern city of Netivot. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said the “overwhelming majority” of Israeli casualties resulted from close-contact shooting, not rockets.\n\nGaza was plunged into darkness on Saturday evening after Israel cut off its electricity and launched waves of airstrikes into the enclave. The Israeli air force hit what it described as 17 military compounds and four operational command centers belonging to Hamas. Footage taken Saturday showed the destruction of a 14-story residential building in Gaza City known as the Palestine Tower.",

  "text": "In their waking hours they watch the news or check their phones, hoping for a text message or maybe a brief call. They want some indication that family members or friends are okay. That they have food and water. That they are alive. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning.For many of the Washington region’s Palestinians and Palestinian Americans, including artists, activists, business owners and educators who have made the area their home, the days following the horrific assault by Hamas militants on Israel last weekend have been filled with worry. They knew there would be retribution for the rocket attacks and bloody incursion that included hostage-taking and claimed the lives of more than 1,300 people in Israel, including many civilians.\n\n“I immediately realized the retaliation is going to be unimaginable, given the wars I’ve lived through,” said Ahmed Mansour, 30, a documentary filmmaker in Silver Spring, Md., who grew up in Gaza and left there in 2015. He said he speaks daily with his parents and eight siblings, who live in the central area of the Gaza Strip. Although they have avoided the worst of the bombardment by Israeli forces, other family members have not escaped. Mansour said that two of his uncles’ homes have been bombed and that one of his cousins was killed.\n\nOn Friday, Israel ordered more than 1 million residents of the narrow and densely populated Gaza Strip to move out of its northern region in anticipation of a ground offensive by the Israeli military to remove Hamas from power. The United Nations called for the evacuation order to be rescinded, saying the mass displacement “could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”\n\nMansour said in an interview Friday that he is worried about his family members and that he also is concerned about how the news media are covering the situation in Gaza, saying they fail to convey in their reporting why anger in Gaza continues to fester and boil over. He also criticized U. S. leaders for not pushing urgently for a peaceful solution.\n\n“For 15 years, the Gaza Strip has been under siege and endured five wars,” he said, referring to Israel’s tight security cordon around Gaza. “For 75 years, Palestinians have been enduring one catastrophe after another. … If we’re serious about what’s really happening, I expected American officials would be more considerate about what’s happening and take it as a chance to really solve it rather than calling for an escalation.”\n\nHanna Alshaikh and her husband, who live in the Washington suburbs, have been in contact every few hours with his parents and family members in Gaza. On Thursday they learned that Alshaikh’s husband’s 88-year-old grandmother was injured when a neighboring home was bombed and glass in her windows shattered. Everyone they know in Gaza knows someone who has been killed or injured or whose home has been destroyed, said Alshaikh, 30, a Palestinian American who is pursuing a doctorate in history at Harvard University.\n\n“We oscillate between feelings of grief and despair and feelings that time is of the essence and is precious,” she said. “And we do not have the luxury of experiencing our own fear and experiencing our own sadness.”\n\nWhile her husband’s family does not live in the area that has been ordered evacuated, she said, “they do not feel that anywhere is safe in Gaza. They are packed and ready to leave at any moment.”\n\nAlshaikh also worries that Palestinian Americans may become targets of hate crimes in the United States, especially if they speak out against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Asked about the Hamas raid into Israel last weekend, she said, “Nobody wants to see civilians harmed.”\n\nNassar grew up on a farm in Bethlehem in the West Bank where his family grows grapes, olives, almonds and figs. He said he does not have relatives in Gaza but worries about a war that could spread to include the West Bank, a patchwork of areas effectively under Israeli control and others governed by the Palestinian Authority, a longtime rival to Hamas, which is dominant in Gaza. As he has watched events unfold, he can only think, he said, that “violence is not the answer.”\n\nNassar said he has received text messages from several Jewish friends in the United States asking whether he is okay. On Friday, he heard from a rabbi he had befriended who texted to check on him. The opportunity for similar friendships does not exist where he grew up, he said.\n\nChris Habiby, who lives just outside D. C. and whose parents are Palestinian, said he has been checking on cousins who live in Gaza and have been moving from house to house to stay safe. His family has been able to reach them twice this week.",

  "text": "President Biden said in an interview broadcast Sunday that a new Israeli occupation of Gaza would be “a big mistake,” comments that came as Israel is expected to launch a hard-hitting ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.“I think it’d be a big mistake,” Biden said in a response to a question from “60 Minutes” host Scott Pelley. “Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that … it would be a mistake … for Israel to occupy … Gaza again.”\n\nBiden’s warning against reoccupying Gaza amounted to one of his firmest efforts so far to impose a limit on Israel’s actions in retaliation for Hamas attacks that have killed at least 1,400 people. Still, he added, “going in but taking out the extremists — the Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south — is a necessary requirement.”\n\nBiden sought to draw a distinction between Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza and launched a bloody attack on Israel on Oct. 7, and ordinary Palestinians who are now facing dire conditions in the densely populated enclave of over 2 million people, more than half of whom are children.\n\nEven without a formal occupation, Israel controls most aspects of life in Gaza, and most Palestinians are not able to exit the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza after the attacks, cutting off food, water, fuel and electricity, a tactic that human rights groups have said violates the laws of war. Gaza is almost out of fuel, and many residents do not have access to safe drinking water.\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of that has killed more than 2,600 people. The White House is in discussions with Israeli officials about Biden traveling to Israel, potentially as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about private deliberations.\n\nIsraeli media reported that during a phone call on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invited Biden to Israel. Officials of both countries are talking about the feasibility of such a trip, which could present logistical and political difficulties if Biden visits while a fierce Israeli incursion into Gaza is underway.\n\nIsrael last week urged more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours in advance of its incursion, an order the United Nations called impossible. Hundreds of thousands of Gaza civilians have fled south, while others chose to stay in their homes after hearing reports of airstrikes hitting potential exit routes.\n\nAsked whether Israel would pursue a path toward a Palestinian state after the Hamas attacks, Biden said “not now.” Still, he added, “I think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.”\n\nPalestinian gunmen from Hamas launched their surprise attack more than a week ago after breaking through Israel’s sophisticated border fence. The militants hunted civilians in their homes and cars and took scores of people hostage into Gaza, including some Americans. At least 30 U. S. citizens were killed in the attacks, U.S. officials said.\n\nBiden and his top officials have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors into Gaza to enable fuel and food to come in. Israel’s energy minister, Israel Katz, said Sunday that Netanyahu and Biden have reached a deal to restore water supplies to some parts of southern Gaza.\n\nWhen asked whether it was time for a cease-fire, given the number of Palestinian civilians who have already been killed in the aerial counterattack, Biden said Israel has a duty to respond to the horrific attacks.\n\n“Israel is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust,” Biden said. “Israel has to respond. They have to go after Hamas. Hamas is a bunch of cowards. They’re hiding behind the civilians.”\n\nBiden, who has spent much of his 50-plus years in politics steeped in foreign policy, has always been firmly pro-Israel even as some parts of the Democratic Party have increasingly questioned the U. S. military and diplomatic support for the country.\n\nSome liberals have raised concerns over Israel’s years-long punishing blockade of Gaza and its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu has also formed the most far-right government in Israel’s history, sought to overhaul its independent judiciary and all but dismissed the idea of a two-state solution.\n\n“I’m confident that Israel is going to act under … the rules of war,” Biden said, a statement he has made multiple times in the past week. “There’s standards that democratic institutions and countries go by. And so I’m confident that there’s going to be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water.”",

  "text": "BRUSSELS — Police fatally shot the gunman who killed two people in the Belgian capital in a terrorist attack, authorities said Tuesday, ending a manhunt that had left the city on edge, but doing little to ease fears of an uptick in political violence across Europe. The attack in Brussels came days after a teacher was fatally stabbed at French high school in what authorities are investigating as a terrorist attack. And countries across Europe have been on guard for political violence that might spill over from the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nMonday’s attack in Brussels targeted three Swedish nationals, killing two and wounding one, on an evening when Sweden was playing Belgium in a Europe 2024 qualifier soccer match. That game was suspended and the city put on high alert while police searched for the attacker.\n\n“Last night, three people left for what was supposed to be a wonderful soccer party. Two of them lost their lives in a brutal terrorist attack,” Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said at an early morning news conference. “Their lives were cut short in full flight, cut down by extreme brutality.”\n\nDe Croo said the attacker was Tunisian and had been “staying illegally in our country.” Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne said the man had been denied asylum in 2019 and had been previously suspected of involvement in human trafficking and being a risk to state security. He suggested that the attacker may have targeted nationals of Sweden because of Quran burnings there, which have led to threats and protests.\n\nIn a video that emerged after the shooting, a man asserted responsibility for the attack and identified himself as a member of the Islamic State extremist group — though Belgium’s federal prosecutor said he was probably a lone wolf.\n\n“We all have a vulnerability. It’s what comes with being a democracy, a rule-of-law state where there are individuals who can decide at a given moment to commit the worst acts,” Macron told reporters while visiting the Albanian capital, Tirana, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nAlthough neither of the attacks appears to have strong links to the war between Israel and Hamas, many European capitals have heightened their security over concern that the conflict will spur violence in their own countries. In recent days, cultural landmarks in France and schools in multiple countries have received bomb threats, while authorities reported a rise in antisemitic hate crimes.\n\nSince Hamas launched its attack on Israel, the European Union has conveyed conflicting messages — over whether aid to Palestinians should continue, over whether Israel needs to emphasize restraint — inviting criticism from all sides.\n\n“The E. U. will have little ability to influence events unfolding in Israel and Gaza but could be seriously impacted by them,” wrote Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.\n\nAlthough Belgian officials said the gunman in Monday’s attack had a criminal record and was known by local authorities, federal prosecutor Frédéric Van Leeuw said, “We did not have indications that the person needed to be watched.”\n\nThe suspect in France had likewise been known to security authorities — French intelligence officials had been wiretapping his conversations and had interacted with him a day before, but said they had no evidence on which to detain him before the stabbing.\n\nFor France and Belgium, the attacks are a reminder of a spate of terrorist violence in 2015 and 2016. In July, six men were convicted for their roles in a 2016 attack that killed 32 and injured hundreds in Brussels. A year before that assault, a team of gunmen claiming allegiance to the Islamic State carried out attacks in Paris that killed over 100 people.\n\nDespite measures put in place to stop those kinds of attacks from happening again, the attacker in Brussels managed to kill two people and escape the scene of the crime, sowing fear across the city.\n\nThe Swedish team donned black arm bands in their match on Tuesday and posted on social media: “Yesterday we tragically lost two blue-and-yellow supporters, on site in Brussels to do something that should be a matter of course — to support our Swedish national team in the blue and yellow national team shirt. Our thoughts go out to all the loved ones of the victims.”\n\nThe attacker remained at large overnight. According to the federal prosecutor’s office, a witness called Brussels police at 8 a.m. Tuesday to say the suspect was in a cafe in the Schaerbeek district. “The police arrived at the scene and during the intervention, the suspect was shot,” a statement said. “The emergency services also arrived at the scene and tried to resuscitate the man.” He was pronounced dead at the hospital.",

  "text": "The White House specified that Biden wanted the video to emphasize what his administration has done to get more EVs on the road — the sort of instruction that is anathema to traditional news organizations. In less than an hour, the video had a million views and it ultimately racked up more than 38 million, becoming Mac’s most-watched post.\n\n“Our communications strategy is ‘all of the above’ — which it must be to break through in a fractured media environment and an era of information overload,” LaBolt said. “We study where Americans get their information and make sure we are meeting them where they are, whether that is traditional newscasts, social media or consumer outlets.”\n\nCBS’s “60 Minutes” also scored exclusive time with the president at last year’s Detroit Auto Show, and correspondent Scott Pelley used it to press Biden on such issues as how he would hold down gas prices amid the Ukraine war. Roughly 10 million people watched the “60 Minutes” segment live, a smaller viewership than four NFL games airing at the same time, according to data collected by the Nielsen company. This past Sunday, “60 Minutes” aired another interview with the president, offering his most direct answers yet to questions about the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nBiden is hardly the first president to turn to nontraditional sources to reach a different audience. Clinton appeared on an MTV town hall in 1994 (where he was asked if he wore boxers or briefs). President Barack Obama appeared on the comedy show “Between Two Ferns” in 2014 (where he was asked, “How does it feel to be the last Black president?”)",

  "text": "TEL AVIV — On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas’s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel’s border fence.\n\nHamas’s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: “We were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?” Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, “to lull Israel into complacency,” while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters’ apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n“Those who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,” said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried “data files on the territories and settlements they raided.”\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: “The responsibility is mine,” Bar wrote. “Despite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately … we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.”\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was “to free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,” Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n“Hamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,” said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. “But just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,” she said, predicting “a war for which we don’t yet have the words to describe.”\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority — Hamas’s longtime rival — was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack.",

  "text": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces’ most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “every Hamas fighter” will be “destroyed,” while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n“I think they’re going to go back in, heavy, and it’s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,” said Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be “dragged out over a much longer period of time” than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities — including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people — have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would “end” the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be “impossible” for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an “integrated and coordinated attack” by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel’s offensive is “obviously going to be much larger” now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be “exponentially greater” than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in “dog fights” between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has “become very efficient” at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces’ advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas’s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn’t sustainable.\n\n“They didn’t want to go into Gaza again. They didn’t want to occupy it. They didn’t want to be responsible for administrating it,” Misztal said. “But now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?”\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel “at this time” — but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power.",

Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.Physicians and public health experts have pointed to one culprit time and again when asked why Americans live shorter lives than peers in nations with similar resources, especially people felled by chronic diseases in the prime of life: stress.A cardiologist, endocrinologist, obesity specialist, health economist and social epidemiologists all said versions of the same thing: Striving to get ahead in an unequal society contributes to people in the United States aging quicker, becoming sicker and dying younger.Recent polls show adults are stressed by factors beyond their control, including inflation, violence, politics and race relations. A spring Washington Post-Ipsos poll found 50 percent of Americans said not having enough income was a source of financial stress; 55 percent said not having enough savings was also a source of stress.“We should take a step back and look at the society we’re living in and how that is actually determining our stress levels, our fatigue levels, our despair levels,” said Elizabeth H. Bradley, president of Vassar College and co-author of the book “The American Health Care Paradox.” “That’s for everybody. Health is influenced very much by these factors, so that’s why we were talking about a reconceptualization of health.”The Washington Post’s efforts to gain a deeper understanding of how stress can cause illness, disability and shorter lives led to a once derided body of research that has become part of the mainstream discussion about improving America’s health: the Weathering Hypothesis.Stress is a physiological reaction that is part of the body’s innate programming to protect against external threats.When danger appears, an alarm goes off in the brain, activating the body’s sympathetic nervous system — the fight-or-flight system. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is activated. Hormones, such as epinephrine and cortisol, flood the bloodstream from the adrenal glands.The heart beats faster. Breathing quickens. Blood vessels dilate. More oxygen reaches large muscles. Blood pressure and glucose levels rise. The immune system’s inflammatory response activates, promoting quick healing.Once the threat passes, hormone levels return to normal, blood glucose recedes, and heart rate and blood pressure return to baseline. That’s how the human body should work.Life brings an accumulation of unremitting stress, especially for those subjected to inequity — and not just from immediate and chronic threats. Even the anticipation of those menaces causes persistent damage.The body produces too much cortisol and other stress hormones, straining to bring itself back to normal. Eventually, the body’s machinery malfunctions.The constant strain — the chronic sources of stress — resets what is “normal,” and the body begins to change.It is the repeated triggering of this process year after year — the persistence of striving to overcome barriers — that leads to poor health.Blood pressure remains high. Inflammation turns chronic. In the arteries, plaque forms, causing the linings of blood vessels to thicken and stiffen. That forces the heart to work harder. It doesn’t stop there. Other organs begin to fail.It’s part of the weathering process, a theory first suggested by Arline T. Geronimus, a professor and population health equity researcher at the University of Michigan.Geronimus, whose book “Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society” published in March, started out studying the health of women and babies as a graduate student in the 1980s, having been influenced by two distinctly different jobs she had as an undergraduate: one as an on-campus research assistant, the other as a peer companion at an off-campus school for teen mothers. At the time, she said, conventional wisdom held that the Black community had higher rates of infant mortality because teen mothers were physically and psychosocially too immature to have healthy babies. But her research showed younger Black women had better pregnancy and birth outcomes than Black mothers in their mid- to late 20s and 30s.For this, she was criticized as someone arguing in favor of teen pregnancy, even though she was not. Shaken but undeterred, she continued trying to understand the phenomenon, which meant better understanding the overall health of the community these teens depended on for help. As she studied those networks, she recognized “people’s life expectancies were shorter, and they were getting all these chronic diseases at young ages,” she said.But she hadn’t come up with a name yet for what she was witnessing. That happened in the early 1990s while sitting in her office: “‘Weathering’ struck me as the perfect word.”She said she was trying to capture two things. First, that people’s varied life experiences affect their health by wearing down their bodies. And second, she said: “People are not just passive victims of these horrible exposures. They withstand them. They struggle against them. These are people who weather storms.”People seem to instinctively understand the first, but she said they often overlook the second. It isn’t just living in an unequal society that makes people sick. It’s the day-in, day-out effort of trying to be equal that wears bodies down.Weathering, she said, helps explain the double-edged sword of “high-effort coping.”Over the years, Geronimus widened the aperture of her research to include immigrants, Latinos, the LGBTQIA community, poor White people from Appalachia. She found that while weathering is a universal human physiological process, it happens more often in marginalized populations.Regulation of cortisol — what we think of as the body’s main stress hormone — is disrupted. Optimally, it should work like a wave with a steep morning rise followed by a rapid decline, which slows until reaching baseline at bedtime.But existing research suggests that is blunted by repeated exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors, such as perceived racial discrimination, which flatten this rhythm.Stress-induced high cortisol levels stimulate appetite by triggering the release of ghrelin, a peptide that stimulates hunger.The interplay between elevated cortisol and glucose is especially complex and insidious, eventually leading to obesity, fatigue, cardiovascular disease, poor immune and inflammatory functions, higher breast cancer mortality rates and other metabolic disorders. Dysregulated cortisol also increases depression and anxiety and interferes with sleep.It begins in the womb. Cortisol released into a pregnant person’s bloodstream crosses the placenta, which helps explain why a disproportionate number of babies born to parents who live in impoverished communities or who experience the constant scorn of discrimination are preterm and too small.During the coronavirus pandemic, pregnant women experiencing stress endured changes in the structure and texture of their placentas, according to a study published this year in Scientific Reports.The toxic stream can persist into childhood fueled by exposure to abuse, neglect, poverty, hunger. Too much exposure to cortisol can reset the neurological system’s fight-or-flight response, essentially causing the brain’s stress switch to go haywire.Too much stress in children and adolescents can trigger academic, behavioral and health problems, including depression and obesity.Stress can change the body at a cellular level.The effects of relentless stress can be seen at the chromosomal level, in telomeres, which are repeated sequences of DNA found in just about every cell.Telomeres are the active tips of chromosomes, and they protect the cell’s genetic stability by “capping” the ends of the chromosomes to prevent degeneration. (Think of the plastic tips of shoelaces.)Researchers have discovered that in people with chronically high levels of cortisol, telomeres become shortened at a faster rate, a sign of premature aging.The shorter the telomeres, the older the cell’s biological age.Shortened telomeres cause a disconnect between biological and chronological age.“I don’t think most people understand weathering stress. Stress is such a vague term,” Geronimus said. “But it still gives us a leverage point to get in there and see a more complex and more frightening picture of what it does to people’s bodies and whose bodies it does it to.”Changes in seven biomarkers in cardiac patients during a 30-year period showed Black patients weathering about six years faster than White people, a 2019 study published in SSM-Population Health found.Research also found that Black people experience hypertension, diabetes and strokes 10 years earlier than White people, according to a study published in the Journal of Urban Health. The impact of repeatedly activating the body’s stress response is called allostatic load.Research has shown that Mexican immigrants living in the United States for more than 10 years have elevated allostatic load scores compared with those who have lived here for less than a decade, and a study of Ohio breast cancer patients published in May in JAMA Network Open found that women with higher allostatic loads — who tended to be older, Black, single and publicly insured — were more likely to experience postoperative complications than those with lower allostatic loads.“The argument weathering is trying to make is these are things we can change, but we have to understand them in their complexity,” Geronimus said. “This has to be a societal project, not the new app on your phone that will remind you to take deep breaths when you’re feeling stress.”So, in short, social inequality causes stress, leading to shortened telomeres and, in turn, premature aging, disease and early death.Design and development by Stephanie Hays, Agnes Lee and Carson TerBush.

  "text": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider and more devastating Middle East war are growing as clashes with Iranian-backed Hezbollah intensify along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Israel presses ahead with its plans for a ground incursion into Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas. The fears spiked on Tuesday following a strike on a Gaza hospital that appears to have killed hundreds of people, triggering angry denunciations and calls for vengeance across the region. Demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank, marched to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and converged on Israeli diplomatic missions in Turkey and Jordan, blaming the strike on Israel, which has denied responsibility.\n\nThe bloodshed fueled already rising tensions between Israel and Iran, which backs Hamas along with an array of allied militias and proxies. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned before the strike that Iran’s militia allies in the “resistance front” could take what he called “preemptive action” to deter an Israeli ground offensive, and the risk is high that an incident such as this could prompt escalatory attacks in revenge. “We have to retaliate from Lebanon,” the demonstrators chanted in Beirut.\n\nOver the past decade, Iran has built up a formidable array of militias and proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in addition to Hamas, and all or any of them could be called on to open up new fronts. Iran also has to calculate whether it can afford to expend the considerable military leverage it derives from these allies in a potentially ruinous conflict for the purpose of defending one of them, Hamas, in Gaza.\n\nWashington has positioned two aircraft carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah, and could also be drawn into the fight if Hezbollah launches a full-scale assault on Israel. Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah forces there, would almost certainly join in; there have already been exchanges of fire along the Syrian border, and activists report that Iranian-allied fighters have been relocating to southern Syria from the east of the country.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, is the well-armed, battle-trained and highly disciplined Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, said Michael Horowitz, director of intelligence at Le Beck security consultancy. Hezbollah has amassed between 130,000 and 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, some of which could reach deep into Israeli cities or be used to deliver precision strikes against Israeli military facilities such as air bases, curtailing Israel’s fighting capabilities.\n\nBut Israel probably would also inflict massive damage on Lebanon, as it did in the 2006 war and the 1982 invasion of the country. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon that “the price you will pay will be far heavier” than in any previous war.\n\nIt appears the Iranians do not want an escalation and are keen to find ways to avoid one, according to a regional diplomat familiar with some of the Iranian conversations with that nation’s allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. While making it clear that their allies are prepared to fight, Iran and Hezbollah have not publicly set red lines for what scenario in Gaza would trigger their involvement — which could range from continued attacks on Gaza, the launch of a ground invasion or only in the event that Hamas is at risk of being completely defeated, the diplomat said.\n\nA senior Hamas official, speaking from Beirut, insisted that Iran was not involved in the Hamas assault, in which at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed and nearly 200 taken hostage. He said Hamas had not anticipated the scale and speed of the collapse of Israel’s defenses and that Hamas was caught off guard also by the ferocity of Israel’s response; over 3,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli airstrikes, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\n“Of course the Iranians help us and train us and give us support, but this operation specifically was very confidential and secret,” said Ali Barakah, who heads Hamas’s international relations department. He described what he said was intended as a “limited operation” to trade Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners and said the expectation was that Israel would conduct limited airstrikes against Gaza before embarking on negotiations.\n\nBuilt up over decades since the creation of Hezbollah in 1982, the strategy aims to position enough militia firepower on Israel’s borders to deter an Israeli attack on Iran, a long-standing fear that has grown in recent years as Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. The Palestinian cause is central to the strategy and to Iran’s identity as a revolutionary Islamic state.\n\nOver the past two years, Iran has sought to reinforce the strategy with a concept known as “unity of fronts,” under which Hezbollah, Hamas and other regional allies have pledged closer cooperation and mutual defense, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah and Hamas have set up a joint coordination center in Beirut with a view to collaborating in ways that further deter Israel from attacks on any one of them.\n\nIran almost certainly doesn’t want to risk undermining Hezbollah’s deterrent capabilities for the sake of Gaza, but at the same time it can’t afford to be seen as abandoning its allies if the deterrence is to survive, Knights said.",

  "text": "Democrats have been almost entirely unified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas hunted civilians in their homes and cars, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages, including some Americans, into Gaza. The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.\n\nBut a small yet growing number of Democrats have begun urging the Biden administration to do more to encourage Israel to limit civilian casualties in its counterattack and ensure that innocent Palestinians are able to receive basic needs and humanitarian assistance. The shifting dynamic could create political and diplomatic complications for Biden amid the announcement late Monday that he will visit Israel.\n\nBiden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel’s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians. On Sunday he named a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, and the White House has begun emphasizing its work to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow through Gaza and that Palestinian civilians can flee areas Israel is targeting.\n\nThis is not the first time Biden’s ironclad support of Israel has put him at odds with the more liberal wing of his party, as Democrats have grown increasingly willing to challenge Israel as its government has become more right-wing. Some Democrats have raised concerns or outright opposition to U. S. military support to Israel, pointing to its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank and its years-long punishing blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also formed the most far-right government in Israel’s history, though that has been replaced since the attacks by a unity government that includes centrist parties.\n\nBiden has said Israel has a duty to respond to the attacks, which he has called as consequential as the Holocaust, but he seemed to impose limits when he said during a television interview airing Sunday that Israel reoccupying Gaza would be “a big mistake.” Israel captured the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war, but it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, leading to a Hamas takeover of the territory two years later.\n\n“This is a special moment where we would really encourage the Biden administration to weigh in with Netanyahu and say that we don’t want to have an even greater humanitarian crisis right now,” Schakowsky, who represents a district in Chicago and its northern suburbs with a significant Jewish population, said Friday. “We’re very worried about that.”\n\nA White House summary of Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U. S. coordination with the United Nations, as well as Egypt, Jordan, Israel and other countries to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. “President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,” the readout said.\n\nBiden and his top aides are focused on preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflagration and have repeatedly warned other actors, such as Iran, not to get involved. They are also concerned that anger in Arab countries whose citizens are highly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause could set off such a conflict, according to a senior administration official, who  spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.\n\n“They know an Israeli ground incursion that has really high casualties could inflame not just the situation among Palestinians but in the broader region,” said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. “There’s a genuine concern that the threat of Hamas needs to be eliminated … but at the same time, how do you make sure that innocent Palestinians aren’t targeted?”\n\n“J Street adamantly rejects the charge that it threatened endorsees,” said the organization’s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. “Over the past 10 days, we’ve spoken to many members of Congress to explain why support for Israel, condemnation of Hamas and recognition of Israel’s right to defend itself are core values of the organization. We want those we support to hear how important it is to us that our partners stand up for Israel even as we also speak out on the crisis now facing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”\n\nThe conflict has inflamed tensions in more direct ways as well. Capitol Police last week had a meeting with nine progressive Democrats, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush, about their safety. A Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said the lawmakers are receiving significantly more threats than they have in the past. The meeting was put together by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N. Y.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.).",

  "text": "Biden will also visit Jordan, where he plans to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has endured Israeli airstrikes that have killed more than 2,700 Palestinians.\n\nHamas has taken scores of hostages into Gaza, including an unknown number of Americans. Biden will work to get as much information about the hostage situation as possible during his trip, White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing with reporters Monday evening.\n\nKirby emphasized that the United States had not sought assurances that Israel would not launch its ground invasion while Biden was visiting the country. “We’re not dictating terms or operational directions to the Israelis,” Kirby said. “We don’t want to see escalation. We want to make sure humanitarian assistance begins to flow.”\n\nStill, U. S. officials waited to announce Biden’s travel to Israel on Monday night until they received commitments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a humanitarian package, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken received assurances during a marathon meeting in Tel Aviv this week and then made the announcement that Biden would be visiting.\n\nDuring the 7½-hour meeting, Israeli and U. S. officials set up separate rooms and passed papers between the two sides, negotiating over humanitarian issues including getting aid into Gaza and creating safe zones for Palestinian civilians, said a State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.\n\nThough Blinken hailed an agreement on humanitarian issues, his announcement included few details, probably an indication that differences remain between the two allies. The provision of humanitarian aid is sensitive in Israel, especially among far-right politicians tied to Netanyahu who have pressed him to wage a scorched-earth campaign in Gaza in response to the terrorist attack.\n\nThe White House is deeply concerned about the conflict spiraling into a broader regional conflagration, and Biden has warned other actors, particularly Iran, not to jump in. His visit to Israel could underline that message.\n\nOfficials are also worried that anger in Arab countries, where many citizens have deep sympathy for the Palestinian cause, could boil over and create pressure for their leaders to take action against Israel.\n\nBiden has repeatedly emphasized his support for Israel and said the country has a duty to respond to the horrific attack, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas breached Israel’s sophisticated border fence in several places before hunting civilians in their homes and cars and shooting people indiscriminately.\n\nBut the president and his top aides have also sought to draw a distinction between Hamas and Palestinian civilians. In recent days, they have stressed their efforts to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow into Gaza and to secure a humanitarian corridor where Palestinian Americans can leave the densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children.\n\nIsrael has said its goal is to eliminate Hamas and has urged more than 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza to avoid being in harm’s way, an order the United Nations called impossible. It also announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, fuel, electricity and water, which human rights groups have said violates international law.\n\nBiden spoke with Sisi on Monday, the White House said, and the two discussed “ongoing efforts to alleviate the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the U. N., Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and other regional partners.”\n\nEgypt has helped broker cease-fires between Israel and Palestine during past incursions and plays a critical role in ongoing efforts to secure humanitarian assistance. And on Egypt’s border with Gaza, the Rafah crossing could be the only way out for Palestinians seeking to flee the enclave amid Israel’s bombardment campaign.\n\nBlinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave.\n\nBut there was confusion over the agreement and the crossing remained closed, deepening frustration and panic among aid groups, who warn that time is running out for wounded and displaced Gazans to receive critical — and, in many cases, lifesaving — supplies.\n\nThe planned trip to Israel is in some ways reminiscent of Biden’s visit in February to Kyiv, as he was seeking to dramatically show his support for Ukraine. That trip, too, was aimed at showcasing Biden’s personal support for an ally that had suffered a bloody attack, in Ukraine’s case at the hands of Russia. That visit was kept secret until Biden’s arrival.",

  "text": "After the deadliest attack in Israel’s 75-year history, which claimed more than 1,200 lives, Israeli officials have vowed to cripple Hamas — the Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the assault. Israel’s military says it has carried out more than 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. More than 1,100 people have been killed, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nThe Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes. Many were concentrated in heavily populated areas in the north.\n\nIsrael has pledged to focus its fire on Hamas fighters and abide by international law. Hamas said Wednesday that Israeli strikes targeted the head of its military wing, killing his brother. Two members of the group’s political office were killed Tuesday.\n\nBut mosques, hospitals, residential buildings and international aid groups have also been hit. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that 13 health-care facilities were affected by the strikes. Nine U. N. staffers were killed in the strikes.\n\nGazans have lived under an Israeli blockade for 16 years. The 140-square-mile territory is among the most densely populated places on Earth. Of its 2 million people, about half are children — many have never been outside the strip.\n\nIsrael announced a complete siege of Gaza after the attacks. The country cut off power to the territory, leaving many residents in the dark. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials confirmed Gaza’s sole power plant had run out of fuel. Access to water, sanitation facilities and health care will be affected by the outages, aid groups warned.\n\nAll crossings out of the enclave have been closed, leaving residents with nowhere to go.\n\nMore than 263,000 people are displaced across the strip, according to the U. N. Many have sought shelter in overcrowded U.N. schools. More than 1,000 housing units are estimated to have been destroyed.\n\nThe strikes are the beginning of what Israel has said will be its largest-ever offensive in Gaza, where people have already lived through multiple wars since Hamas seized power. Some 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up, the most in 50 years. Troops are massed on Gaza’s border as Hamas continues to fire rockets into Israel.",

  "text": "At the heart of every good Halloween story is a mystery. Will the Great Pumpkin ever come? What are Beetlejuice’s intentions? Is “The Nightmare Before Christmas” a Halloween movie? But this year, October’s greatest mystery comes not from our screens but from a national retailer. Lewis. What is he, really? He’s a giant piece of Halloween decor, yet he seems to be so much more. (Or is he really less?) At a towering 8 feet tall and shrouded in a tattered black robe, he has a pumpkin face and a toothy smile. He’s the latest oversize outdoor Halloween decoration to take the internet by storm during spooky season, but unlike his brethren — see Home Depot’s taller-than-God skeleton or weirdly ripped werewolf — there’s something vampier about Lewis. Something campier. Could it be a hint of actual personality?\n\nA few weeks ago, Sydney Rexford was shopping for discounted Halloween candy with her mom at her local Target in South Lebanon, Ohio, when she heard a voice echoing throughout the aisles. The voice wasn’t haunting or creepy, nor did it resemble anything you might find in a Spirit Halloween store. The voice was … sassy.\n\nSkip to end of carouselStyle is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here. Lewis. Okay. Not a jack-o’-lantern. Got it.Rexford stopped short of buying her own Lewis because of the $180 price tag, but decided it was the “funniest thing ever.” She thought other people might want to meet Lewis, too. Her TikTok video featuring him has nearly 9 million views, and hundreds more have circulated on the app since.“It reminds me of Vine,” Rexford says, recalling the defunct early-2010s social media app featuring short, looping videos. “They don’t make sense, but they’re funny. If this was the Vine era, it’d 100 percent be a Vine.”\n\nLydia Deavel, a senior at the University of Northwestern in Minnesota, erupted into laughter with her roommate when she saw a video of Lewis on her feed. They went hunting for a version of their own the next day. In the video that followed, she’s worshiping at the feet (does he have feet?) of Lewis like a peasant before a king.\n\nStill, Deavel says, she’d like to hear about the lore of Lewis from Target itself. Where did the idea come from? What were those pitch meetings like? Who voiced Lewis?\n\n“We really found magic this year,” says Target’s internal product design team, which is in charge of coming up with characters such as Lewis the “ghoul,” defined by Merriam-Webster as “a legendary evil being that robs graves and feeds on corpses.” (Though that seems not very Lewis-like.) Anyway, the design team continues: “When we were gathering bits of this and that, a charismatic pumpkin came to life. We greeted the jack-o’-lantern and he was quick to let us know his name was not Jack, but actually Lewis. We knew a star was born.”\n\n“I fear even a slight breeze,” says one review online. Another mentions that, “on a windy day when his sash is blowing in the breeze it triggers his sensor. He jabbers all day & night like a 4 yo that’s had skittles and soda.”\n\n“We took him in and he is a blast,” says another review. “Always down for a spooky movie, serving up some hot tea or sticking up for the little guys. [Lewis] slays like the queen (or king) they are meant to be.”\n\nAnd while we’re on the topic of slaying, it should be noted that many of his biggest fans — TikTokers and commenters alike — agree that Lewis, like the Babadook of yore, is something special to the queer community. His pizzazz-filled phrases certainly could fit on a panel of RuPaul’s judges.\n\n“It’s definitely the representation that I think we need in Halloween decor,” says Hillary Mace, who purchased her own Lewis after her girlfriend introduced them via TikTok. “It’s the amount of sass and attitude.”\n\nWhere Home Depot’s giant skeleton is imposing, its arms stretching toward the heavens, Lewis is just … Lewis. A friendly face with a cheeky catchphrase. Lewis feels like a step toward something cheesier, less majestic and more camp, and back toward the (relatively) uncomplicated Vine era.\n\n“When he is ready to tell his story, we will all be here to listen,” Mace says. “For right now, he’s a man of few words, but what he has to say is sufficient. We just need to listen.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nH Street was once a symbol of D. C.’s rebirth. Now, it’s barely holding on.A window at a convenience store on H Street NE is shattered in October. The corridor’s challenges have been exacerbated by violent incidents in the past year. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) The red neon sign was in place over the entrance and the shelves were neatly stocked with wines, whiskeys and vodkas. Sorab Dilawri was ready to launch his new liquor store on that corridor of D.C. cool known as H Street NE.Two days before opening in mid-September, just before dawn, burglars threw a brick through Dilawri’s window. They tipped over a row of shelves, smashing $10,000 worth of red wines and adding to the toll of crime jarring the neighborhood and city beyond.By mid-October, a month after H Street Liquors opened, Dilawri had swept up shattered glass from two more break-ins. “I’m scared for my life,” the 40-year-old owner said from behind his cash register, contemplating his options. “What are you going to do? Stay home?”A decade ago, following years of disinvestment after the 1968 riots, H Street NE evolved into a haven of buzzworthy cuisine and nightlife, drawing visitors from across the region. As luxury high-rises went up and a Whole Foods Market opened, the neighborhood became, after the city’s financial collapse in the 1990s, a symbol of D.C.’s rebirth.Yet, more recently, the allure of H Street has faded as the corridor has come to reflect a more contemporary version of Washington — a city still recovering from the pandemic, buffeted by economic uncertainty and battered by violent crime.Located northeast of the U.S. Capitol, from Second to 15th streets NE, H Street’s diminished prospects are partly the result of competition from newer nightlife playgrounds at the Wharf, Navy Yard and nearby Union Market, as well as traditional standbys like U Street, Adams Morgan and Georgetown.The corridor’s challenges also are exacerbated by violent incidents over the past year that drew national attention, including assaults on a member of Congress and a staffer. At the same time, a steady grind of burglaries, robberies and stolen cars add to a collective sense of unease. There also is the near-constant presence of aggressive panhandlers and clusters of people lingering on sidewalks, many of them appearing disheveled, disoriented and, at moments, menacing.As October ended, a community group felt  it necessary to advise  a neighborhood email list that a D.C. judge had released a man with no fixed address who had been arrested on H Street after allegedly threatening two people with a machete.“Please be alert,” wrote Bobby Pittman, chair of the First District Citizens Advisory Council. (By then, the judge had issued a pretrial stay-away order, barring the suspect from being with 100 yards of the two targets.)Surveillance video shows two burglars breaking into the H Street Liquor store and tipping over the shelves on Sept. 6, two days before it was scheduled to open. (Video: Sorab Dilawri)Days later, the owners of a restaurant with locations on H Street and Dupont Circle announced they are shutting down, citing a “spike in violent crime” among their reasons.“I’m just done,” Aaron McGovern, who closed Brine Oyster and Seafood House on Nov. 11, said in an interview. Several months ago, he also shuttered Biergarten Haus, a longtime H Street tavern. “People don’t want to come to H Street, not only because there are better options but because of the scariness of the street.”“People don’t want to come to H Street, not only because there are better options but because of the scariness of the street.”— Aaron McGovern, who closed two eateries on H Street this yearAt 11 p.m. on a recent Friday, the longest line — two dozen people — was outside the Safe House, among the 20 or so marijuana shops that have opened on H Street since 2021. Landlords, seeking to avoid punishing tax penalties, were willing to lease vacant storefronts to cannabis entrepreneurs, said Anwar Saleem, who, as executive director of H Street Main Street, a nonprofit business advocacy group, maintains a list of the shops.Saleem acknowledged in an interview that the strip “doesn’t feel comfortable,” a sense he attributed to corner drug dealing, the homeless population, a pervasive smell of marijuana and other factors. His organization, he said, has spent $30,000 this year fortifying the security systems of businesses and replacing windows shattered during break-ins.“You walk past people, and you feel their spirit and you know it ain’t right,” he said. “We want to reclaim the street. We need a reset. We are going to set the example for the city.”As she made her rounds one recent day, D.C. police Capt. Sherrelle Williams stopped at Shop & Run, a convenience store on the corner of H and Eighth streets NE, where the front window looked like a glass spiderweb — cracked from a brick someone threw three months ago.Many of the store’s shelves were bare. Where the chips should have been, there was nothing. Same with the shelves  for freshly made sandwiches and doughnuts.The owner, Mohammad Mohammad, stopped ordering food a couple weeks ago. He is breaking his lease two years early, saying he is fed up with $5,000-a-month in shoplifting losses, the $14,000 monthly rent and the marijuana peddlers too often lingering outside his door.“Maybe tomorrow will be my last day,” Mohammad, 38, told the captain.“Give us 30 days,” Williams said. She repeated herself twice more: “Give us 30 days.”The captain took responsibility for H Street in July and needs time to get things straight. She has started what she touts as a “boots on the ground” campaign involving residents, business owners, city agencies, and police officers on bikes, scooters and in cruisers.“We want to disrupt what’s happening on H Street,” she told a recent meeting of 40 residents and business owners. At one point, she promised to have a bench removed from Eighth Street, where people linger at all hours, near storefront real estate ads that announce, “You Belong Here.”As he listened to the captain, Itay Hertz, an Israeli-born security consultant who bought a rowhouse in the neighborhood in 2022, worried that the police department’s approach is more reactive than proactive.“They talked about taking a bench,” he said later. “What is the strategic plan?”Hertz’s concerns sharpened earlier this year when a neighbor was mugged while pushing his daughter in a stroller at 8 a.m. on a Saturday. “Took his money, phone and the shirt off his back,” Hertz said, an account confirmed by the victim. In October, a man with a pipe lumbered toward Hertz’s wife, Elisabeth, cursing and threatening her as she took a lunchtime stroll.Hertz said he plans to train volunteers for a neighborhood patrol modeled after those that he said exist in Israel. The goal, he said, is not to intervene, but to document illegal activity and alert police. “I want eyes on the street,” he said.The growing sense of danger in the neighborhood is reflected in crime data. Since January, for example, the number of violent crimes increased from 77 to 95, or 23 percent, compared to the same period last year. The number of stolen cars rose from 115 to 163, or 41 percent, while robberies increased from 63 to 78, or nearly 24 percent and burglaries jumped from 14 to 37. Overall crime is up nearly 6 percent.The increase in violent crime has been greater elsewhere, including the U Street neighborhood, where the number of incidents jumped nearly 87 percent in that same period. Yet, what distinguishes H Street is the public attention catalyzed by high-profile incidents, the most recent in September when Blake Bozeman, a former Morgan State University basketball player, was fatally shot at the Cru Lounge.A little more than a year ago, Washington Commanders running back Brian Robinson Jr. was shot and wounded during an attempted robbery on H Street NE. In February, Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) fought off an apparently disturbed attacker in her apartment building who she said punched her in the face. The following month, a man stabbed an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) during a random late-afternoon encounter on the corridor.“Everyone is replaying the same news over and over,” said Adam Kelinsky, the owner of Pursuit, a wine bar on H Street NE that has been burglarized five times this year. “If eight stations cover the same thing, the word is out. At some point, people are going to say, ‘I’ve seen this eight times, this is bad. I’m not going over there.’”The neighborhood’s anxiety was enough to draw a recent visit from Police Chief Pamela A. Smith, who walked the corridor and listened as owners of shops, bars and restaurants talked of desolate streets and creeping fear.“Instead of stealing a candy bar, they’re stealing the entire store,” Leon Robbins, owner of Stan’s, a longtime clothing store, told the chief, describing a problem that he says is afflicting cities throughout the country. “Business is horrible. Crime is horrible.”Ryan Gordon, owner of the Queen Vic, a British-style pub, told the chief he closes earlier because he fears for his employees’ safety leaving work late at night. “It would kill me if something happened to one of my staff,” he said.A block away, Smith stopped at Pursuit, the wine bar, where Neal Gearhart, the general manager, complained that the streets empty at nightfall. “It’s crime that keeps people away,” he said.One recent Saturday, Gearhart told the chief, he made “$50 in revenue for the day.”A bustling shopping area in the 1950s, H Street NE was ravaged by rioting after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. By 2000, 75 percent of its storefronts were vacant, and the strip became known as a place to buy and use heroin.Around then, Mayor Anthony Williams (D) seized on H Street’s potential, endorsing zoning policies that attracted developers, investors and the likes of Joe Englert, a nightlife impresario who opened themed bars with whimsical names like the Rock & Roll Hotel, H Street Country Club, and the Palace of Wonders.By the end of 2012, H Street ranked sixth on Forbes magazine’s list of “America’s  Hippest Hipster Neighborhoods.” Four years later, after numerous delays, the city opened a $200 million streetcar system that provides free transport along the corridor.Dolly Vehlow and her husband, Steve Hessler, an attorney, were among those who “bought into the dream of the H Street promise.” They acquired three buildings, leased two more, and opened Gallery O on H in 2005, where they exhibit art, host concerts, and lease space for weddings and other events.Now, Vehlow said, when they show the gallery to people shopping for a place to hold an event, “they look around and rave about how gorgeous it is, and that’s the last we hear from them.”She and her husband attribute the decline in interest to the neighborhood’s poor buzz.“We’re dying, our business is dying and our dream is dying,” Hessler said. The couple remains committed to H Street, for now. “If there’s no change in the next six to eight months, you’re going to hear something different,” he said.Tony Tomelden, the owner of the Pug, a dive bar and H Street pillar since 2007,  is unwilling to make any such pronouncement even as his revenue — $50,000 a month a decade ago — is less than half that now.On a recent night, the Pug hosted a Taylor Swift-themed party, and there was the bearded owner, greeting patrons in a glittery dress and a blond wig. “I have to be optimistic,” he said. “Otherwise, I’m going to choke somebody.”On a recent afternoon, Dilawri bought 20 boxes of pizza and stacked them on a folding table outside his liquor store.“FREE PIZZA,” read the chalkboard at his feet. A half-hour later, he was down to his last box.The three break-ins during his first month cost him around $18,000 in lost liquor sales and repairs, he said. After the second, he installed a buzzer to control who gets into his shop. Still, he ponders ways to build neighborhood relationships. Pizza was his first idea. An art exhibit is  planned for December.“This is about creating goodwill,” he said. “Showing people we don’t mean any harm. Karma.”Two days later, he was sweeping up the glass from another shattered window and filing one more police report.Story editing by Jennifer Barrios. Photo editing by Mark Miller.

  "text": "Democrats have been almost entirely unified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas hunted civilians in their homes and cars, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages, including some Americans, into Gaza. The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.\n\nBut a small yet growing number of Democrats have begun urging the Biden administration to do more to encourage Israel to limit civilian casualties in its counterattack and ensure that innocent Palestinians are able to receive basic needs and humanitarian assistance. The shifting dynamic could create political and diplomatic complications for Biden amid the announcement late Monday that he will visit Israel.\n\nBiden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel’s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians. On Sunday he named a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, and the White House has begun emphasizing its work to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow through Gaza and that Palestinian civilians can flee areas Israel is targeting.\n\nThis is not the first time Biden’s ironclad support of Israel has put him at odds with the more liberal wing of his party, as Democrats have grown increasingly willing to challenge Israel as its government has become more right-wing. Some Democrats have raised concerns or outright opposition to U. S. military support to Israel, pointing to its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank and its years-long punishing blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also formed the most far-right government in Israel’s history, though that has been replaced since the attacks by a unity government that includes centrist parties.\n\nBiden has said Israel has a duty to respond to the attacks, which he has called as consequential as the Holocaust, but he seemed to impose limits when he said during a television interview airing Sunday that Israel reoccupying Gaza would be “a big mistake.” Israel captured the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war, but it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, leading to a Hamas takeover of the territory two years later.\n\n“This is a special moment where we would really encourage the Biden administration to weigh in with Netanyahu and say that we don’t want to have an even greater humanitarian crisis right now,” Schakowsky, who represents a district in Chicago and its northern suburbs with a significant Jewish population, said Friday. “We’re very worried about that.”\n\nA White House summary of Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U. S. coordination with the United Nations, as well as Egypt, Jordan, Israel and other countries to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. “President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,” the readout said.\n\nBiden and his top aides are focused on preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflagration and have repeatedly warned other actors, such as Iran, not to get involved. They are also concerned that anger in Arab countries whose citizens are highly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause could set off such a conflict, according to a senior administration official, who  spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.\n\n“They know an Israeli ground incursion that has really high casualties could inflame not just the situation among Palestinians but in the broader region,” said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. “There’s a genuine concern that the threat of Hamas needs to be eliminated … but at the same time, how do you make sure that innocent Palestinians aren’t targeted?”\n\n“J Street adamantly rejects the charge that it threatened endorsees,” said the organization’s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. “Over the past 10 days, we’ve spoken to many members of Congress to explain why support for Israel, condemnation of Hamas and recognition of Israel’s right to defend itself are core values of the organization. We want those we support to hear how important it is to us that our partners stand up for Israel even as we also speak out on the crisis now facing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”\n\nThe conflict has inflamed tensions in more direct ways as well. Capitol Police last week had a meeting with nine progressive Democrats, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush, about their safety. A Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said the lawmakers are receiving significantly more threats than they have in the past. The meeting was put together by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N. Y.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.).",

  "text": "On Friday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) became the second Republican in three days to win the conference’s nomination for speaker. But his aggressive efforts this past weekend to win over House Republicans skeptical of supporting him indicate that his path to the speakership will be no easier than the previous nominee, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), who dropped out Thursday.\n\nToday, Republicans are set to meet behind closed doors at 6:30 p.m. to try to unite. One suggested that they might want to bring a Festivus pole, though, because these meetings have produced little more than the airing of grievances over the past two weeks.\n\nJordan and his supporters spent the weekend reaching out to the 55 House Republicans who said in a secret-ballot vote on Friday that they wouldn’t back him on the floor (or at least those that Jordan’s team believes aren’t behind him, because it was a secret ballot).\n\nTwo more people with knowledge of Jordan’s outreach told us that Jordan, who is close with former president Donald Trump, has been using hardball tactics to try to win over the holdouts. (Other people also told us and Marianna Sotomayor on Friday that this pressure campaign was already underway.)\n\nIf Jordan goes through with it, Republicans who vote against him on the floor could be perceived as voting against Trump because he has endorsed Jordan. It could also draw the ire of right-wing media outlets — and even raise the threat of primary challenges.\n\n“Whether or not Republicans are willing to work together with us is not for me to say but instead is something you need to ask Republicans,” Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, said in a statement to The Early on Saturday. “But everyone knows that working together can’t mean ‘my way or the highway,’ it has to be give and take.”",

In less than an hour, the video had a million views and it ultimately racked up more than 38 million, becoming Mac’s most-watched post.\n\n“Our communications strategy is ‘all of the above’ — which it must be to break through in a fractured media environment and an era of information overload,” LaBolt said. “We study where Americans get their information and make sure we are meeting them where they are, whether that is traditional newscasts, social media or consumer outlets.”\n\nCBS’s “60 Minutes” also scored exclusive time with the president at last year’s Detroit Auto Show, and correspondent Scott Pelley used it to press Biden on such issues as how he would hold down gas prices amid the Ukraine war. Roughly 10 million people watched the “60 Minutes” segment live, a smaller viewership than four NFL games airing at the same time, according to data collected by the Nielsen company. This past Sunday, “60 Minutes” aired another interview with the president, offering his most direct answers yet to questions about the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nBiden is hardly the first president to turn to nontraditional sources to reach a different audience. Clinton appeared on an MTV town hall in 1994 (where he was asked if he wore boxers or briefs). President Barack Obama appeared on the comedy show “Between Two Ferns” in 2014 (where he was asked, “How does it feel to be the last Black president?”)\n\nMac said Biden’s burgeoning relationship with TikTokers shows that he is looking to engage with a younger audience, one that is unlikely to turn to traditional sources for its news. He doesn’t see that changing; Mac is in talks with administration officials to record a “crib tour” of the East Wing.",

  "text": "President Biden faces growing pressure from lawmakers in both parties to punish Iran after Hamas’s massacre this month, as the administration tries to support Israel without expanding an already gruesome conflict in the Middle East. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.On Monday night, Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) sent a letter to the White House, signed by more than 110 lawmakers, demanding more aggressive financial sanctions on Iran, pointing to ties between Tehran and the militants who carried out the bloody attack on Israel. Backed by more than 60 House Democrats, the letter said the administration should block Iranian oil sales to other countries such as China, aiming to dry up one of the regime’s key sources of funding.\n\nSo far, the White House has not adopted this approach, though its position could change quickly. Any dramatic move against Iran risks intensifying a regional conflict that the Biden administration wants to calm as much as possible, and restricting Iranian oil sales could send global gas prices skyward ahead of next year’s presidential election.\n\nHow the administration responds could hinge on what U. S. intelligence agencies ultimately conclude about Iran’s role in Hamas’s attack. U.S. officials previously told The Washington Post that Hamas received weapons and training from Iran, but produced no evidence linking Iran directly to the slaughter. Iran’s foreign minister said Monday that “preemptive action” against Israel from unspecified “leaders of the Resistance” could be expected and that “we cannot be indifferent to the war crimes committed against the people of Gaza.” All 100 senators will be briefed about the Hamas attack and Israel’s war in Gaza on Wednesday by senior administration officials.\n\n“Iran must be held fully accountable for its continued role in funding Hamas and Islamic terror,” states the congressional letter, which praises Biden for his assistance to Israel thus far in the crisis. “We urge the Administration to take all necessary steps to cut off Iranian funding sources. This includes maximum enforcement of all U. S. sanctions, and taking any and all steps to end Iran’s oil trade to China.”\n\nIf the United States does decide to punish Iran, the country’s oil revenue would pose an obvious target. (Already, U. S. officials and the Qatari government agreed last week to suspend a $6 billion humanitarian fund for nongovernmental organizations in Iran funded by Iranian oil sales, eliciting a rebuke from Tehran.) Iran is exporting around 1.5 million barrels of oil per day — the vast majority of it to China — in a major increase from the nearly 1 million barrels it was exporting per day at the start of Biden’s term, according to Scott Modell, chief executive officer at the Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nThe White House already faces political headwinds from rising gas prices that could threaten Biden’s reelection bid. A sanctions crackdown on Iran, if not offset by more oil from another source, could lead the price of oil to spike by more than $10 a barrel, probably bringing the average price of a gallon of gas from $3.66 to above $4, Modell said.\n\n“It would fly in the face of where the administration has been. The White House has wanted to keep Iranian oil flowing; they want to build on this working détente,” said Modell, who also cautioned that price fluctuations would depend on how long oil traders expect new sanctions to remain in place. “When you’re talking about taking 500,000, or 1 million, barrels per day out, the market will react to that.”\n\nOn the Senate floor Monday, top Republicans took repeated aim at the Biden administration’s approach to Tehran. The GOP has been demanding a particularly hard line: Former president Donald Trump last week falsely blamed the Hamas attack on Biden’s move to allow the $6 billion humanitarian fund, even though no money from the fund had been spent and it was limited to humanitarian purposes, with U. S. officials getting veto power over each transaction.\n\nIran is under one of the most restrictive U. S. sanctions programs in the world. An almost total economic embargo prevents international firms from doing business with Iranian financial institutions or importing Iranian-origin products, among myriad other economic activities. Further restrictions are likely to face resistance from many Democrats wary of inflaming the region further.\n\n“At this extremely delicate moment, it is in the U. S. interest to prevent the latest violence from escalating into a full-blown regional conflict,” said one senior House Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe caucus dynamics. “It would be maddening if hawkish lawmakers with a long-standing goal of fomenting war with Iran succeed in pushing the U.S. into new sanctions and escalation with Iran on this totally fabricated pretext.”\n\n“Iran is already under the heaviest sanction of any country in the world, and has been for a long time,” said Duss, now executive vice president of the Center for International Policy, a D. C.-based think tank. “Piling more sanctions on top of sanctions does not seem to be working, especially when there is such an enormous political cost to removing sanctions when Iran does things we want to do.”\n\n“A lot of sanctions introduced by Congress are duplicative,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign policy think tank, who stressed he had not yet seen the current congressional proposals. “They have no real additional impact on Iran because the items in question are already under sanction. It can make the lawmakers look like they’re doing something even if what they’re doing is not new or impactful.”",

  "text": "Rep. Jim Jordan, the firebrand conservative from Ohio, appeared closer to becoming the next speaker of the House on Monday after mounting an aggressive pressure campaign over the weekend to gain the support of more than 50 Republican holdouts skeptical of his ability to lead the chamber. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.If he takes the gavel, it would be a remarkable ascent for Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman who built his political identity as a founding member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus and an attack dog for President Donald Trump who was once referred to as a “legislative terrorist.” He was a key ally in Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and he defied a subpoena during the congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nBut there are still members adamant in their opposition to Jordan, including some who plan to back former speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). As House Republicans filed into another closed-door meeting in the Capitol on Monday night, at least 10 said they will not support Jordan on the first round of voting Tuesday or were undecided. Jordan can only afford to lose four votes on the floor.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers said that it is likely Jordan would lose in the first round of voting, but that some lawmakers left an opening to support him in a second or third round. However, if voting goes longer than three rounds, some Republicans said lawmakers may start nominating other people — meaning they will be making real-time decisions as options potentially expand.\n\nThe move to a floor vote without a guarantee that he has the support is a reversal from early last week. Jordan was reluctant to put the party through another embarrassing public spectacle that could further divide the group, vowing to only go to the floor if he firmly had the backing of 217 Republicans — give or take one or two depending on attendance — to win the speakership.\n\nBy midday Monday, the tide started to turn for Jordan as powerful and influential House Republicans started to announce their support. In a key development, Rep. Mike D. Rogers (R-Ala.), chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said he would support Jordan after previously saying he would not. Rogers had been resistant to Jordan’s skepticism of ballooning defense spending and additional Ukraine aid. But Rogers, the target of an aggressive social media campaign over the weekend by Jordan supporters, said he received a commitment from Jordan “to fund our government’s vital functions.”\n\nAfter Rogers went public with his support, the dam began to break. Fervent supporters of Scalise, previously angry over his treatment by the Ohio Republican during the speaker nomination process, came out in support of Jordan, including Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), who said last week that she would never back Jordan. Her concerns have been “allayed,” she said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter sent to the Republican conference on Monday, Jordan urged members to unite behind him on Tuesday and promised to bring “all Republicans together” by acquiescing to some demands brought up in the numerous closed-door gatherings the House GOP has held over the past two weeks. Those meetings, held ostensibly to draw the conference together, have become grievance sessions in which members have repeatedly expressed displeasure at leadership.\n\n“This has nothing to do with Jim Jordan. This has to do with the integrity of the House Republican conference,” he said. “I think when you go outside the rules of your own caucus because you didn’t get your way, I think that is truly sad. I think that’s an indictment of who you are.”\n\nHouse Majority Forward, a political nonprofit working to elect Democrats to the House, has launched robocalls in 11 Republican lawmakers’ districts — most of them swing ones — to urge recipients to call their representative and tell them to vote against Jordan, pointing out his “extreme agenda.” Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), who was being targeted, rebuffed the effort, saying, “My district knows me as Juan. They know they didn’t elect a politician to be their representative but their neighbor. So that’s why whoever the speaker is, they know who I am.”\n\nJordan, who joined the House in 2007, has been a stalwart of the hard right. He previously served as chair of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative House members. The Ohio lawmaker also was one of eight House members who served on Trump’s defense team during the president’s first impeachment trial in the Senate. Before he left office, Trump awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom — the nation’s highest civilian honor. Jordan now chairs the powerful House Judiciary Committee, a role that has allowed him to launch investigations into President Biden.",

  "text": "Trailing Trump by huge margins in the GOP presidential primary and running out of time to close the gap, DeSantis has taken an increasingly aggressive approach to his top rival. For months, wary of alienating Trump’s loyal base, DeSantis criticized the former president only when asked and took subtler swings in his stump speeches. But his comments over the past week underscore a shift in posture this fall, with DeSantis routinely knocking Trump by name and sometimes broaching his character.\n\nDeSantis has always pitched himself to voters as a more effective, disciplined version of Trump — an heir to his agenda who is more likely to follow through, less toxic to swing voters and undistracted by personal drama. Now he’s making that case more forcefully and seizing new opportunities to hit Trump as they arise, blasting the former president’s comments of the day on issues ranging from the Israel-Gaza war to six-week abortion bans.\n\nIt’s not clear the blunter approach will make a difference for DeSantis, who has fallen far behind Trump since launching his campaign in a more competitive standing and is now fighting for a distant second place with rivals. Polling and focus groups have repeatedly found that most attacks don’t work on Trump and can even backfire as voters who like the former president react defensively.\n\n“I’m gonna say it in here if I get the opportunity,” Kristine Willets, a retiree long torn between Trump and DeSantis, said before heading into Mario’s Sports Bar & Grill with her grandson. “Stop doing that. We don’t care about that.”\n\nWillets came out of the event agreeing with some of DeSantis’s objections: “Trump should have fired [FBI director Chris] Wray,” she said. She raved about DeSantis, declared him “ready” to be president and praised his answer to her question about the war in Ukraine (“We need to end the conflict.”)\n\n“Think of the chaos that was going on in his term,” Willets said. “No one ever had to put up with this stuff Trump put up with.”\n\nDeSantis’s presidential hopes likely rest on people like Willets: Trump voters in Iowa — where DeSantis has focused his resources — who are open to other options in 2024. So far, most Trump supporters have proved difficult to win over.\n\nDeSantis and his allies have sought to criticize Trump as both hard to elect in the general and insufficiently conservative on key issues in the primary — noting that he once allowed transgender women to compete in his Miss Universe pageant or that he didn’t get rid of Anthony S. Fauci, who helped lead the U. S. coronavirus response under Trump and inspires hatred from many Republicans.\n\nRepublican candidates and groups aiming to defeat Trump have tried many lines of attack and DeSantis is no exception. Asked recently on the campaign trail why someone should vote for him over Trump — in a moment promoted on social media by a pro-DeSantis super PAC — the governor ticked swiftly through a list of arguments over five minutes, saying that he has a stronger record of fulfilling policy promises; can serve longer in office; and is more capable of staffing an effective administration.\n\nDeSantis’s support among voters favorable to Trump has steadily dropped from a high point early this year, before he officially joined the presidential race. Many of those Republicans have gravitated back toward Trump as he racks up criminal indictments — and DeSantis himself has echoed Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that the prosecutions are politically motivated, mostly declining to criticize the former president on that front.\n\nAsked why DeSantis has sharpened his criticisms lately, campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo — who recently called Trump’s comments on Israel “disturbing and disqualifying” — said DeSantis “has simply been pointing out how the former president isn’t the same guy as he used to be” and responding to off-script blunders.\n\nAt first, DeSantis avoided criticizing Trump to the point that even veiled jabs made news. In March, when Trump was indicted in New York, DeSantis made headlines for his pointed allusion to the sordid allegations against Trump — “hush money to a porn star” — even as he joined broad GOP condemnations of the case.\n\nBut they were less frequent and DeSantis advisers said their priority was introducing DeSantis positively rather than aggressively contrasting with Trump. And DeSantis didn’t criticize Trump by name in his stump speeches, which usually decried a “culture of losing” in the GOP.\n\n“We have the Donald Trump on the teleprompter, where he’s reading what’s on there,” DeSantis told reporters in New Hampshire last week. “Then you have Donald Trump when he gets off that teleprompter, and that’s the real Donald Trump.” He accused Trump of making the conflict in Israel “about him” with his criticisms of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

  "text": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider and more devastating Middle East war are growing as clashes with Iranian-backed Hezbollah intensify along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Israel presses ahead with its plans for a ground incursion into Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas. The fears spiked on Tuesday following a strike on a Gaza hospital that appears to have killed hundreds of people, triggering angry denunciations and calls for vengeance across the region. Demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank, marched to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and converged on Israeli diplomatic missions in Turkey and Jordan, blaming the strike on Israel, which has denied responsibility.\n\nThe bloodshed fueled already rising tensions between Israel and Iran, which backs Hamas along with an array of allied militias and proxies. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned before the strike that Iran’s militia allies in the “resistance front” could take what he called “preemptive action” to deter an Israeli ground offensive, and the risk is high that an incident such as this could prompt escalatory attacks in revenge. “We have to retaliate from Lebanon,” the demonstrators chanted in Beirut.\n\nOver the past decade, Iran has built up a formidable array of militias and proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in addition to Hamas, and all or any of them could be called on to open up new fronts. Iran also has to calculate whether it can afford to expend the considerable military leverage it derives from these allies in a potentially ruinous conflict for the purpose of defending one of them, Hamas, in Gaza.\n\nWashington has positioned two aircraft carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah, and could also be drawn into the fight if Hezbollah launches a full-scale assault on Israel. Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah forces there, would almost certainly join in; there have already been exchanges of fire along the Syrian border, and activists report that Iranian-allied fighters have been relocating to southern Syria from the east of the country.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, is the well-armed, battle-trained and highly disciplined Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, said Michael Horowitz, director of intelligence at Le Beck security consultancy. Hezbollah has amassed between 130,000 and 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, some of which could reach deep into Israeli cities or be used to deliver precision strikes against Israeli military facilities such as air bases, curtailing Israel’s fighting capabilities.\n\nBut Israel probably would also inflict massive damage on Lebanon, as it did in the 2006 war and the 1982 invasion of the country. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon that “the price you will pay will be far heavier” than in any previous war.\n\nIt appears the Iranians do not want an escalation and are keen to find ways to avoid one, according to a regional diplomat familiar with some of the Iranian conversations with that nation’s allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. While making it clear that their allies are prepared to fight, Iran and Hezbollah have not publicly set red lines for what scenario in Gaza would trigger their involvement — which could range from continued attacks on Gaza, the launch of a ground invasion or only in the event that Hamas is at risk of being completely defeated, the diplomat said.\n\nA senior Hamas official, speaking from Beirut, insisted that Iran was not involved in the Hamas assault, in which at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed and nearly 200 taken hostage. He said Hamas had not anticipated the scale and speed of the collapse of Israel’s defenses and that Hamas was caught off guard also by the ferocity of Israel’s response; over 3,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli airstrikes, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\n“Of course the Iranians help us and train us and give us support, but this operation specifically was very confidential and secret,” said Ali Barakah, who heads Hamas’s international relations department. He described what he said was intended as a “limited operation” to trade Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners and said the expectation was that Israel would conduct limited airstrikes against Gaza before embarking on negotiations.\n\nBuilt up over decades since the creation of Hezbollah in 1982, the strategy aims to position enough militia firepower on Israel’s borders to deter an Israeli attack on Iran, a long-standing fear that has grown in recent years as Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. The Palestinian cause is central to the strategy and to Iran’s identity as a revolutionary Islamic state.\n\nOver the past two years, Iran has sought to reinforce the strategy with a concept known as “unity of fronts,” under which Hezbollah, Hamas and other regional allies have pledged closer cooperation and mutual defense, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah and Hamas have set up a joint coordination center in Beirut with a view to collaborating in ways that further deter Israel from attacks on any one of them.\n\nIran almost certainly doesn’t want to risk undermining Hezbollah’s deterrent capabilities for the sake of Gaza, but at the same time it can’t afford to be seen as abandoning its allies if the deterrence is to survive, Knights said.",

  "text": "“Today’s decision is an absolute abomination and another partisan knife stuck in the heart of our Democracy by Crooked Joe Biden, who was granted the right to muzzle his political opponent,” the unsigned statement from the Trump campaign said. “President Trump will continue to fight for our Constitution, the American people’s right to support him, and to keep our country free of the chains of weaponized and targeted law enforcement.”\n\nCampaigning in Iowa, Trump called the gag order “so unconstitutional,” falsely claiming that he was “the only politician in history who runs who’s not allowed to criticize people.” He also hinted that he might escalate the conflict. “What they don’t understand is I am willing to go to jail if that’s what it takes for our country to win,” he said.\n\nBut because Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith is prosecuting both the D. C. case against Trump and the Florida charges, there are implications for Trump’s conduct in the Florida case as well. And it’s possible some witnesses in the D.C. case who fall under the new gag order — such as Gen. Mark A. Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — could also be called as witnesses in the documents case or the Georgia state case, in which Trump is accused of trying to obstruct the 2020 vote counting there.\n\n“I will prohibit statements about potential witnesses or the subject of their testimony,” Chutkan said. “If Mr. Trump wants to criticize his political rival, Mr. Pence, he may do so, but he cannot make statements about Mr. Pence’s role in the events in this case. … Without this restriction there is a real risk that other witnesses may be intimidated or unduly influenced, and that other witnesses may be reluctant to come forward lest they be subjected to the same harassment and intimidation.”\n\nChutkan and Lauro jousted repeatedly during the hearing, and the judge at one point laughed when Lauro said there had been no threats and no intimidation from Trump. She cited Trump’s social media post about Milley, which claimed that a phone call the general made to his Chinese counterparts in early 2021 was “an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH.”\n\nGaston, the prosecutor, said Lauro was trying to split hairs and that Trump’s meaning was clear: “We both know that the tweet or the post about General Milley was a threat. It was a threat to him, and it was a threat to all witnesses in this case: If you come after the defendant, he will come after you.”",

  "text": "More than 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip have been released since they were taken in the cross-border Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Estimates for the total number of hostages seized in the attack that left at least 1,200 people dead in Israel have shifted over the course of the war. As of Wednesday, an estimated 107 living hostages remain in captivity in Gaza, according to numbers provided by Israel, but the country has not given the full basis for its estimates.\n\nA deal between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar, paused the fighting on Nov. 24 and allowed for the release of women and children in exchange for Palestinian women and teens in Israeli prisons. However, fighting restarted Dec. 1, with Israeli warplanes resuming strikes in Gaza.\n\nDuring the pause, 81 Israeli citizens — including those who also hold citizenship from other countries — were released. Under the deal’s framework, every Israeli hostage freed would initiate the release of three Palestinian prisoners. Outside the framework of the exchange deal, 24 foreign nationals — who do not hold Israeli citizenship — were freed. Before the deal, some hostages — including two Americans — were also released or rescued.\n\nThe specific number of hostages who have died in captivity and the ages, genders and nationalities of those remaining in Gaza are unclear. Israel has estimated that the majority of those remaining have Israeli citizenship and are male. It’s unclear how many are members of the Israeli military. Two Americans — Abigail Edan, 4, and Liat Beinin Atzili, 49 — were released under the exchange deal. Fewer than 10 U. S. citizens are now held hostage, according to the White House.\n\nWhile Hamas is thought to hold most of the hostages, some are believed to be held by other militant groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose fighters also took part in the Oct. 7 attack. Israel blames Hamas for the deaths of some hostages and said three were killed in its own operations; Hamas says Israeli strikes have killed some hostages. The Washington Post could not independently verify either side’s claims.\n\nHere is a list of the hostages released and what is known about those who remain.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nIsrael has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars in GazaThe damage in Gaza has outpaced other recent conflicts, evidence shows. Israel has dropped some of the largest bombs commonly used today near hospitals. Data from the United Nations shows damage and destruction around al-Rantisi Hospital in northern Gaza. (MAXAR/The Washington Post) Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has been unlike any other in the 21st century.In response to the unprecedented assault by Hamas on Oct. 7, Israeli airstrikes and a ground invasion that began 20 days later have destroyed large swaths of the besieged territory, killed at least 20,057 people and displaced a vast majority of the population.The most ferocious attacks have come from the air, flattening entire city blocks and cratering the landscape.The Washington Post analyzed satellite imagery, airstrike data and U.N. damage assessments, and interviewed more than 20 aid workers, health-care providers, and experts in munitions and aerial warfare. The evidence shows that Israel has carried out its war in Gaza at a pace and level of devastation that likely exceeds any recent conflict, destroying more buildings, in far less time, than were destroyed during the Syrian regime’s battle for Aleppo from 2013 to 2016 and the U.S.-led campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, in 2017.The Post also found that the Israeli military has conducted repeated and widespread airstrikes in proximity to hospitals, which are supposed to receive special protection under the laws of war. Satellite imagery reviewed by Post reporters revealed dozens of apparent craters near 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza, where the bombing and fighting were most intense during the first two months of war, including 10 craters that suggested the use of bombs weighing 2,000 pounds, the largest in regular use.“There’s no safe space. Period,” said Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who visited Gaza on Dec. 4. “I haven’t passed one street where I didn’t see destruction of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.”Press Enter to skip to end of carouselHow we calculated this damage comparisonTo assess the devastation in Gaza, The Post used data from the U.N. Satellite Center, or UNOSAT, which analyzes satellite imagery from conflict zones to determine how many structures, most of them buildings, have been damaged and destroyed.To compare with Gaza, The Post examined UNOSAT damage data from the Russian and Syrian government campaign against rebels in Aleppo from 2013 to 2016, and from the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, which heavily bombed and shelled the cities of Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, in 2017. UNOSAT has not collected the same kind of data on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Despite the availability of other damage assessment methodologies, The Post relied on UNOSAT data because it maintained a consistent methodology over years across multiple conflict zones.The war has wounded more than 53,320 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. More than 7,700 Palestinian children have been killed, and women and children make up around 70 percent of the dead, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which also says that 1.9 million people have been displaced, equivalent to 85 percent of the population. The vast majority of Gazan civilians fleeing the invasion are not allowed by Israel and Egypt to leave.“The scale of Palestinian civilian deaths in such a short period of time appears to be the highest such civilian casualty rate in the 21st century,” said Michael Lynk, who served as the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories from 2016 to 2022.In a reply to questions from The Post, the Israel Defense Forces sent a statement saying: “In response to Hamas’ barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities. In stark contrast to Hamas’ intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.”This is the Gaza Strip. Each dot represents a damaged or destroyed structure, the vast majority of which are buildings. From the start of the war on Oct. 7 to Nov. 26, the date of the most recent data available, 37,379 structures were damaged.Of those damaged structures, 10,049 were completely destroyed.The bombing campaign and ground combat during this period were the worst in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops entered overnight Oct. 27 and fought close-quarters battles with Hamas fighters.Here, 8,561 structures were completely destroyed. These destroyed structures were among 29,732 damaged in northern Gaza alone.This is Aleppo, more than 1½ times the area of northern Gaza. Russia and the government of Bashar al-Assad waged a brutal, multiyear battle to defeat and eventually besiege rebel groups there.From 2013 to 2016, the period covered by U.N. data, 40 percent of Aleppo’s structures were damaged. In northern Gaza, that figure reached 32 percent by Nov. 26 — seven weeks into conflict.Nearly twice as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza in seven weeks as the 4,773 destroyed in Aleppo over three years.This is Mosul, roughly Aleppo’s size and also more than 1½ times the area of northern Gaza. Iraqi troops, allied militias and U.S. air forces launched an offensive to retake the city from the Islamic State in late 2016.About 1½ times as many structures were damaged in northern Gaza in seven weeks as were damaged across Mosul during the nine-month battle.Nearly twice as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza as were destroyed in Mosul over those same periods.In Raqqa, Kurdish fighters backed by the U.S.-led coalition fought to defeat the Islamic State in 2017.More than 2½ times as many structures were damaged in northern Gaza in seven weeks as were damaged in Raqqa during eight months of strikes.More than three times as many structures were destroyed in northern Gaza as were destroyed in Raqqa over those same periods.Soon after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Israeli military leaders signaled their intent to retaliate with widespread devastation.On Oct. 10, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops he had “released all the restraints” and that “Gaza will never return to what it was.” The same day, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said that “while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage.”In a little over two months, Israeli air forces fired more than 29,000 air-to-ground munitions, 40 to 45 percent of which were unguided, according to a recent assessment from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The bombing rate has been about 2½ times as high as the peak of the U.S.-led coalition’s effort to defeat the Islamic State, which at its height fired 5,075 air-to-ground munitions across both Iraq and Syria in one month, according to data from the research and advocacy group Airwars.— Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee of the Red CrossOne hallmark of the 21st century’s most indiscriminate air campaigns, as in Syria and Ukraine, has been the bombing of hospitals, which cannot be attacked under the laws of war unless they are actively being used to “commit acts harmful to the enemy.”The Israeli military made no secret of its view that Gaza’s hospitals were military targets.“Hamas systematically exploits hospitals as a key part of its war machine,” Hagari, the military spokesman, said on Nov. 5. “We will not accept Hamas’s cynical use of hospitals to hide their terror infrastructure.”By Dec. 14, Israeli bombardment and fighting had forced the closure of more than two-thirds of the 28 hospitals identified by The Post in northern Gaza.As Israel’s military campaign went on, satellite imagery reviewed by The Post showed how heavy strikes around Gaza’s hospitals destroyed entire neighborhoods, wrecked infrastructure and displaced civilians, often making it impossible for hospitals to function.To assess destruction around hospitals, The Post analyzed U.N. Satellite Center data in areas within 180 meters (about 590 feet) — the distance at which the smallest commonly used bombs, weighing 250 pounds, can cause enough damage to make a building uninhabitable, and the largest, weighing 2,000 pounds, can damage a structure beyond repair, according to a report by Armament Research Services commissioned by the International Committee of the Red Cross.The data showed that Israel’s bombardment and other fighting had damaged structures within 180 meters of all of northern Gaza’s 28 hospitals.\n\nAcross northern Gaza, visual evidence and other accounts showed how Israeli forces shot at, bombed, besieged and raided hospitals.The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, Gaza’s only cancer treatment center, shut down on Nov. 1 after nearby airstrikes. At least four cancer patients died afterward, according to the Health Ministry. Al-Rantisi Hospital, the only hospital with a pediatric cancer ward, evacuated on Nov. 10 along with three nearby hospitals after being struck on Nov. 5 and surrounded by Israeli troops days later. Four premature babies left behind on breathing machines at one of the hospitals would later be found dead.Video shot by a journalist in the parking lot of al-Awda Hospital showed nearby strikes filling the air with dust and smoke and raining debris down on ambulances.Debris falls and fire explodes after an airstrike hits near al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, video posted to Instagram on Nov. 10 shows.\n\n(Feras al-Ajrami/Instagram)The Indonesian Hospital evacuated on Nov. 22, three days after artillery fire struck the hospital and killed 12 people. Israeli raids on Kamal Adwan Hospital over several days in mid-December resulted in the hospital’s “effective destruction” and the death of at least eight patients, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted on Dec. 17.In Gaza City, Israeli strikes destroyed much of the neighborhood surrounding al-Quds Hospital, operated by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Israeli forces pushing toward the center of the city fought with Hamas in the vicinity, and videos posted by the PRCS showed the impact of heavy nearby strikes. On Nov. 12, the hospital ceased operating.“What we have been witnessing is a campaign that was planned. It was a plan, definitely, to close down all the hospitals in the north,” said Léo Cans, head of mission for Palestine with Doctors Without Borders.There have been 239 attacks on health-care workers, vehicles and facilities in Gaza that have killed 570 people since the war started, the WHO said on Dec. 13.The IDF has published videos and images that show weapons and other military items, which it said were found in multiple hospitals. Underneath al-Shifa Hospital, Israeli troops excavated a tunnel with multiple empty rooms, alleging that they had been used by Hamas. The military said Hamas fighters there and elsewhere had fled before Israeli troops arrived and taken materiel with them. None of the evidence was possible to verify independently, because Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza except on strictly guided tours.“What we have been witnessing is a campaign that was planned.”— Léo Cans, head of mission for Palestine with Doctors Without Borders“Only the current misuse of the hospital deprives it of its protection, but if that misuse ends, that protection is restored,” said Adil Haque, an international law expert and Rutgers University professor. If there were a tunnel or underground structure beneath the hospital, and troops weren’t sure what was inside them, any doubts should “caution in favor of restraint,” he added.The satellite imagery reviewed by The Post revealed other evidence of how hospitals had come under attack: large craters close to hospitals, many of them bearing the telltale characteristics of large, airdropped bombs.The Post reviewed nearly 100 satellite images taken between Oct. 8 and Dec. 10 and found about three dozen apparent craters within 180 meters of 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza. At The Post’s request, five satellite imagery analysts reviewed images of each crater large enough to suggest the use of a bomb weighing 2,000 pounds or more. While The Post’s findings represent a conservative undercount of the actual number of bombs dropped near Gaza’s hospitals, the imagery shows that hardly a hospital in the north has been left untouched.Ten large craters identified by The Post near hospitals suggested the use of bombs weighing 2,000 pounds, the largest in regular use.The large craters were seen near eight hospitals, more than a quarter of all the hospitals in northern Gaza. Bombs in larger weight classes have larger blast radiuses and are more likely to inflict serious damage that could put even well-built structures like hospitals permanently out of service.At these two hospitals, for example, The Post identified large craters suggesting the use of 2,000-pound bombs within 90 meters (295 feet), the distance at which a bomb of that size could completely destroy buildings within the blast radius.At al-Awda Hospital, northern Gaza’s main maternity center, a crater in the road about 90 meters from the hospital grounds suggested the use of a 2,000-pound bomb in November.On Nov. 21, a strike on the hospital itself killed three doctors, Doctors Without Borders said.At al-Karama Hospital, north of Gaza City, two craters that appeared in Oct. 15 satellite imagery suggested the use of 2,000-pound bombs.The hospital was within the 90-meter blast radiuses of both munitions.It was forced to close on Oct. 17.Officials at humanitarian and health-care organizations with lengthy experience in major conflict zones said Israel’s war in Gaza was the most devastating they had seen.Tom Potokar, a chief surgeon with the International Committee of the Red Cross working in Gaza for the 14th time, said explosive injuries were responsible for all the wounds he and his colleagues at the European Hospital in southern Gaza had been treating. Many patients had necrotic wounds requiring amputation because of the lack of supplies and equipment at battered and besieged hospitals in the north.“For me, personally, this is without a doubt the worst I’ve seen,” said Potokar, who has worked during conflicts in South Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia and Ukraine.Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal and a doctor who worked in Aleppo during the battle for the city, said he believed that “what’s happening right now in Gaza is beyond any disaster that I’ve witnessed at least in the last 15 years or so.”Sahloul estimated it will take decades to rebuild the health-care infrastructure destroyed in Gaza and the knowledge and expertise of the scores of doctors and other health-care workers who have been killed.Preliminary data provided to The Post by Airwars suggested that strikes in Gaza were killing civilians at twice the rate of the U.S.-led campaign in Raqqa. Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, said that the data they provided The Post represented “just a fraction” of the strikes they were currently researching in Gaza, which averaged about 200 strikes per week. In Airwars’s 10 years of work, Tripp said, the group had never documented more than about 250 civilian casualty strikes per month in any conflict.“Make no mistake — U.S. operations in Iraq and Syria, especially in densely populated cities like Mosul and Raqqa, caused devastating civilian harm and destruction,” said Annie Shiel, the U.S. advocacy director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “But what we are seeing in Gaza, the level of death and destruction in this relatively short period of time, is absolutely staggering in comparison. Nowhere is safe for civilians.”“For me, personally, this is without a doubt the worst I’ve seen.”— Tom Potokar, a chief surgeon with the International Committee of the Red CrossPnina Sharvit Baruch, a former high-ranking military lawyer who was responsible for advising Israeli commanders, said that Israel is currently facing “the biggest threat to its existence” from enemies determined to destroy it. Hamas made Gaza a “fortified military area” and operates from within civilian structures, she said, adding that “Hamas’s strategy of using civilians as shields means that attacking its military capabilities leads to unfortunate yet inevitable civilian casualties.” When Israeli commanders weigh civilian harm against military advantage when deciding whether to strike, she said, the “level of threat posed by Hamas [to Israel] is a legitimate component of evaluating the military advantage.”Several humanitarian workers interviewed by The Post noted that Israel’s campaign in Gaza, and its destruction of hospitals and homes, will likely create additional suffering, such as hunger, lack of shelter and the spread of communicable diseases, that could eventually kill more people than the bombs and fighting.Sahloul said he believed the only explanation for so many attacks on civilian sites, which should have been protected by the laws of war, was that such attacks were intentional.“People in Syria told me they can tolerate bombs and missiles, but if there’s no doctors in town and no hospitals, they usually leave,” he said. “So I would have to assume that if it is intentional, the goal is to force the population to leave. And when they leave, they don’t come back.”A previous version of a graphic in this article stated that Mosul's battle lasted eight months. It lasted nine months.The quality of satellite imagery, irregular coverage and even the angle of a satellite’s camera can all affect the ability to identify clear craters. In some cases, craters could be located but not conclusively attributed to a specific munition or payload size. In other cases, damage from the air campaign was clear, but craters were not visible.The Post relied on a conservative assessment of what is and is not a crater and asked multiple experts to review any crater found in within 180 meters of a hospital in northern Gaza that had diameter of at least 40 feet, or 12.1 meters. Any crater with a diameter greater than 11.7 meters found in light soil like Gaza’s, experts said, suggests a bomb weighing 2,000 pounds or more could have been used. To account for inconsistencies in measurements, The Post relied on the slightly larger, 40-foot diameter.The Post focused its analysis on this size because a 2,000-pound bomb dropped 180 meters away could damage a building beyond repair. At 90 meters, that same munition could destroy a building. Only craters that experts agreed on with high confidence were included in this report.Experts cautioned The Post against ascribing particular damage to particular craters, as the amount of damage caused by a bomb can vary widely, especially in a dense urban environment. Damage depends on nearby structures, building materials, the soil, whether a bomb has been set to explode above or below ground, and other factors. Experts also noted that even the largest munitions can be employed to ensure that nearby civilian infrastructure is not damaged or is minimally affected when they explode. But even then, large munitions have inherent characteristics that can only be mitigated to a certain degree, making collateral-damage assessments done before the munition is used key to avoiding civilian harm, they said.Louisa Loveluck in London, Claire Parker in Cairo, Jonathan Baran in San Francisco, and Cate Brown and John Hudson in Washington contributed to this report.Design and development by Junne Alcantara and Irfan Uraizee.\n\nEvan Hill is an investigative reporter at The Washington Post focused on open-source and visual forensic techniques.

They knew the names of each other’s parents and children, had shared photos of their homes and hobbies. It was only a friendship, both said, never romantic. But it was Heymann’s only window into Gaza and Om Ayan’s only contact with an Israeli.\n\nHe was on the way to a demonstration in Tel Aviv when she messaged him. Thousands of Israelis had gathered to call for the release of hostages and the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Heymann was one of only a handful of protesters to call for an end to the war.\n\nBut leaving brought its own agony for Om Ayan, who asked that her current location not be disclosed for security reasons. Her husband’s three older children weren’t allowed to come with them and had to stay behind with their aunts in Rafah. They were already sick from sleeping outside in the cold. Her husband wept.\n\nNow, in a strange apartment of her own, Om Ayan reaches for her daughter in the middle of the night, as she did during the nights under bombardment. Doctors tell her she has high blood pressure that could put her pregnancy in danger. Try to relax, they tell her. But she is glued to the news, terrified for those still trapped in Gaza.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nRafah was Gaza’s last refuge. The overcrowded city is now a target. A number of wounded people were transferred to Kuwait Hospital following Israeli strikes on Rafah in southern Gaza on Monday. (Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post)Rafah, a small city in southern Gaza on the border with Egypt, was one of the last places of refuge during Israel’s war in Gaza, quintupling in population as displaced people from the northern parts of the Strip sought safety.That city is now a target, with Israeli forces carrying out deadly strikes in Rafah early Monday local time and Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy saying that forces “are now approaching a ground offensive in Rafah.” Allies have expressed concerns about military operations there; hours before the strikes, President Biden had pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to move ahead without a plan to protect civilians, according to a senior administration official briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity under White House rules.Israel’s military said it rescued two hostages from Rafah while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza’s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people.Gazans reported heavy bombardment in the city, where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians — more than half of the Strip’s total population — are sheltering. Many are sick or on the verge of famine, and aid groups say families are sleeping on streets and eating grass to survive.“The loss of life we face if Israel goes down into Gaza is huge,” said Bob Kitchen, vice president for emergencies at the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian relief organization operating in Gaza.Israeli officials say the focus on Rafah is needed to complete its task of destroying Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza, after the group’s devastating Oct. 7 attack on Israel.Almost 9 in 10 Palestinians in Gaza have been displacedThe population of Rafah has swelled to “at least” 1.4 million people, Juliette Touma, director of communications for the U.N. agency for Palestinian affairs, UNRWA, wrote in a message. “This is five times the population prewar,” Touma said of Rafah, whose population was estimated at 280,000 before Oct. 7.Israeli officials have not specified what their plans for Rafah look like. The country’s military has already conducted strikes in the area, including an airstrike that hit near the Kuwaiti hospital in the city in December that killed at least 18 people, according to hospital staff.The war in Gaza has drastically reshaped the demographics of the strip. Almost 9 in 10 people living in Gaza are now displaced, according to U.N. estimates, while World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Feb. 1  that “over 100,000 Gazans are either dead, injured, or missing and presumed dead.”Satellite images from Jan. 15, 2023 and Jan. 31, 2024 show the population surge in Rafah, Gaza, since Oct. 7, which rose from 280,000 to 1.4 million people. (Video: Planet)Before Oct. 7, the most populated portion of the strip was Gaza City in the north.On Oct. 13, six days after the Hamas-led assault on Israel that began the war, Israel ordered the evacuation of more than 1 million people living in the areas above the Wadi Gaza wetlands. Many took refuge in Gaza’s second-largest city, Khan Younis, in the south.At the start of December, Israeli authorities ordered Palestinians in Khan Younis to move to new areas as Israel’s forces conducted military operations in the city.More than half of Gaza’s total population is thought to now be in Rafah, where many were “living in makeshift structures, tents or out in the open,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), adding that the city had become a “pressure cooker of despair.”For those facing bombardment in the enclave, leaving Rafah is not a straightforward process. The area is home to the Rafah crossing, which joins the southern edge of the Gaza Strip to Egypt’s northern Sinai region, and Egypt is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees, with concerns for the political and security repercussions.The crossing — the only link from Gaza that Israel does not directly control — is open, but exits has been restricted to people who are able to secure spots on lists from embassies evacuating their nationals and affiliates, and people able to pay expensive fees to travel companies that facilitate movement across the border.Egypt’s hospitals are ready to treat injured Gazans, but the border is closedHumanitarian groups have warned that the amount of aid crossing the Rafah border is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of an increasingly desperate population.“People in Gaza risk dying of hunger just miles from trucks filled with food,” Cindy McCain, head of the World Food Program, said last month in an appeal for new action to allow more trucks to enter Gaza.One Palestinian aid worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly, wrote in a message that the widespread use of tents reminded him of stories his grandfather told him about the living conditions for refugees after the 1948 Israeli-Arab war. The tents, which can be up to 200 square feet in size, would house an entire family or two, the aid worker said.Winter temperatures have added to the misery. “With this cold and rainy weather, the tent is the last place anyone would want to be in!” they wrote.Sanitary precautions have broken down amid the overcrowding. “Thousands and thousands of people are sharing individual toilets,” Kitchen said, adding that IRC workers in Rafah had seen “queues of four to five hours” to use the bathrooms. Open defecation and urination create public health risks.“We’re already seeing massive reports of acute watery diarrhea, which I think, if tested, would be proven to be cholera,” Kitchen said.The humanitarian crisis is compounded by a political one, as at least 10 Western governments have suspended funding to UNRWA, the chief logistical force for aid in Gaza. The decision to halt funding came after Israel shared a dossier that alleged more than a dozen UNRWA employees had been involved in the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and alleged widespread support for Hamas and other militant groups within the organization.A previous version of this article incorrectly said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant posted his remarks about Rafah on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday. He posted on Thursday.  Niha Masih, Karen DeYoung and Rachel Pannett contributed to this report.",

  "text": "The president, a staunch supporter of Israel who has known Netanyahu for more than 40 years, has been largely reluctant to take his private frustrations public so far, according to the people. But he is slowly warming to the idea, they said, as Netanyahu continues to infuriate Biden officials with public humiliations and prompt rejections of basic U. S. demands.\n\nNetanyahu has angered U. S. officials on several occasions in just the past few days. He publicly denounced a hostage deal while Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in the region trying to broker an agreement. He announced the Israeli military would be moving into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, a move U.S. officials have publicly opposed, because Rafah is packed with about 1.4 million Palestinians living in squalid conditions who fled there under Israeli orders.\n\nFor now, the White House has rejected calls to withhold military aid to Israel or impose conditions on it, saying that would only embolden Israel’s enemies. But some of Biden’s aides argue that criticizing Netanyahu would allow him to distance himself from an unpopular leader and his scorched-earth policies while reiterating his long-standing support for Israel itself.\n\nThe president also spoke in far more detail about Palestinian suffering, as well as the time and energy he has expended trying to get the Israelis and Egyptians to allow more aid into the 25-mile enclave. “A lot of innocent people are starving,” Biden said. “A lot of innocent people are in trouble and they’re dying. And it’s got to stop.”\n\nA particular flash point is Israel’s plan to launch a military campaign in Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza that borders Egypt and has swollen to more than four times its original size. “They’re already living in tents and not getting enough food and water and you’re saying go somewhere else,” said one outside adviser to the White House. “Where? How are they supposed to get there?”\n\nIsrael launched its punishing military campaign in response to a brutal Hamas attack on Oct. 7, when militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 253 hostage. Since then, Israeli airstrikes and raids have killed more than 28,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and displaced more than 80 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, as a siege of the enclave has created a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nBiden also issued an executive order earlier this month imposed sanctions on four West Bank settlers for violence against Palestinians, a move Netanyahu griped about during a private meeting with Blinken last week, officials said. And on Thursday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said an Israeli operation in Rafah “would be a disaster for those people, and we would not support it” — the most forceful the White House has been in opposing an Israeli military operation.\n\nSome of the president’s aides have argued Biden can still support Israel while denouncing Netanyahu. But Biden, who aides say has a visceral attachment to the Jewish state, has tended to view the prime minister and the state of Israel as one and the same, according to several people familiar with his thinking, and has struggled with the idea of criticizing a sitting prime minister, particularly during a time of war.\n\nYet Biden’s patience is wearing thin over how Israel has conducted its military campaign — and he is also paying a growing political price for his embrace of Israel, even as Netanyahu appears eager to score his own political points by publicly snubbing Biden. As Biden heads into a hard-fought reelection campaign, polls shows that young voters, people of color, Muslims and Arab Americans strongly disapprove of his handling of the war.\n\n“I don’t think anybody can look at what the Israelis have done in Gaza and not say it’s over the top,” the official said. “This gets to the frustration with the Israelis. Have they done the work on what comes next in Gaza? No. They haven’t grappled with the really hard questions.”\n\nWhite House officials have increasingly concluded that Netanyahu is focused on his own political survival to the exclusion of any other goal, and is eager to position himself as standing up to Biden’s push for a two-state solution. During a news conference last month, Netanyahu publicly rebuked Biden over his support for a Palestinian state, saying an Israeli prime minister needs to be “capable of saying no to our friends.”\n\nNetanyahu has at times helped reinforce Biden’s view of Israel as a heroic bulwark against global antisemitism. During one visit when Biden was vice president, Netanyahu showed him photos of grossly antisemitic depictions that came from Hamas and argued such incitement was the reason he could not make peace with the Palestinians, according to a person familiar with the interaction, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a private exchange.\n\n“The daily toll that its military operations continue to take on innocent civilians remains too high,” Blinken told reporters at a news conference in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. “Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7. The hostages have been dehumanized every day since. But that cannot be a license to dehumanize others.”",

  "text": "Israel’s military said Marman and Har were both in “good medical condition.” They were transported via military helicopters to Sheba Tel Hashomer Medical Center in Israel, where the medical staff said their condition was “stable” and where they were reunited with their families.\n\n“I salute our brave warriors for the bold action that led to their liberation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. “Only the continuation of military pressure until complete victory will result in the release of all our abductees. We will not miss any opportunity to bring them home.”\n\nArmed Hamas militants were guarding the men and were also spread throughout the building, he said. A minute later, he said, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes; Israeli soldiers shielded the hostages with their bodies as other troops exchanged heavy fire with Hamas fighters.\n\nNetanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were with Israel’s military chief as the raid unfolded. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting, the military said. In a visit Monday with the unit that carried out the operation, Netanyahu called it “one of the most successful rescue raids in the history of Israel. … A perfect operation that was perfectly executed.”\n\nIt was only the second successful rescue mission since the start of the ground incursion into Gaza in late October — on Oct. 30, the IDF rescued a female hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, in addition to 29 others who are believed to be dead, most of them killed during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMany of the families of the hostages and the thousands of Israelis who have joined them in street protests have called on the government to agree to a deal with Hamas to exchange hostages for prisoners, believing it is the only way to guarantee the safety of their loved ones and questioning whether military operations are a realistic strategy on a larger scale.\n\n“We commend the IDF soldiers who demonstrated strength and bravery to secure the release of the two hostages, and wish them all to return home safely and speedily,” said a statement Monday by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing most of the families.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei lauded the rescue operation Monday morning and said in a social media post that in a meeting with Netanyahu last week in Jerusalem, he requested “the release of every one of the Argentine hostages” and continued to “maintain his condemnation of Hamas terrorism.”\n\nThe operation came hours after Netanyahu spoke on the phone with President Biden, who warned that an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah without appropriate accommodations for the civilian population would be seen as unacceptable to the United States, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nOn Monday, it remained unclear how the rescue — lasting about an hour and limited in its scope — would affect Israel’s broader plans for a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, where it says Hamas’s top leaders are hiding, using the remaining hostages as shields.\n\nEgypt has reinforced its border, signaling that it would not accept an exodus of refugees fleeing the fighting. It has warned that an Israeli invasion of the area along its border could endanger the countries’ 1979 peace treaty that has for decades stabilized the region.\n\nThe rescue operation was carried out amid negotiations to return the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as a halt in the fighting. Senior American, Egyptian and Qatari officials are expected to convene in Cairo on Tuesday; it is still unclear if Israel will send a delegation.\n\nDavid Tsur, former head of Yamam, the special counterterrorism unit that was among the agencies involved in the overnight mission, said that because the talks have been so far unsuccessful, the Israeli army took advantage of the “very short window of opportunity” to free the hostages. But he said it will have consequences for future operations.",

  "text": "In an order read out by court president Joan E. Donoghue, the panel called on Israel to prevent the possibility of genocide in its war on Hamas, allow more aid into Gaza and sanction its officials and soldiers for comments that amount to incitement. It directed Israel to submit a report within one month outlining how it is implementing those orders.\n\n“The court found that Russia had no foundation under international law for its claims of self-defense and that it should stop waging war,” said Hebrew University law professor Yuval Shany, a former chairman of the U. N. Human Rights committee and a fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. “In this case, you might read the court’s rulings as an implicit validation that Israel does have a legitimate claim of self-defense.”\n\n“The fact that they have to take measures to prevent genocide, that is, in other words, a cease-fire,” she said. “There are going to be a lot of eyes on this ICJ opinion. I don’t think Israel is going to be able to just slide by like they usually do.”\n\nThe case brought by South Africa has spotlighted deep divisions over the Israeli campaign in Gaza and the way it’s being conducted. In a hearing this month, South Africa argued that Israel had violated the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by both committing and failing to prevent genocidal acts. It asked the court to order Israel to cease military operations there immediately.\n\n“This is definitely a ‘win’ for South Africa, although there won’t be enormous immediate change on the ground,” Juliette McIntyre, a lecturer in law at the University of South Australia who specializes in international courts and tribunals, wrote in an email. “Which means some will criticize the court for not going far enough.”\n\n“It is becoming ever clearer that huge swaths of Gaza — entire towns, villages, refugee camps — are being wiped from the map,” Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, an Irish lawyer on the South African team, said at the hearing. “On average, 247 Palestinians are being killed and are at risk of being killed each day, many of them literally blown to pieces. They include 48 mothers each day, two every hour. And over 117 children each day.”\n\n“It is in response to the slaughter of Oct. 7, which Hamas openly vows to repeat, and to the ongoing attacks against it from Gaza that Israel has the inherent right to take all legitimate measures to defend its citizens and secure the release of the hostages,” said Christopher Staker, a lawyer representing Israel.",

  "text": "UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Saturday that the agency had no knowledge of the underground tunnel and had neither the “military and security expertise nor the capacity” to conduct military-grade inspections of the premises. Israel, he added, had not formally notified UNRWA of the findings under the compound, which staff evacuated on Oct. 12 amid Israeli bombardment.\n\nUNRWA has been under intense scrutiny since late last month, when Israel alleged that 12 of its employees were involved in the Oct. 7 attack led by Hamas, in which gunmen killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 250 hostages. Six of the agency’s employees were alleged to have crossed into Israel on Oct. 7 and four were involved in kidnapping Israelis, according to an intelligence dossier compiled by the Israeli government and reviewed by The Washington Post. The document did not lay out evidence against the accused.\n\nThe claims prompted the United States and Germany, UNRWA’s two biggest donors, to suspend funding along with at least 14 other countries. Amid a looming famine in Gaza, the agency is trying to stretch dwindling resources past the end of February as it pleads with Washington and others to restore  more than $400 million in suspended funds.\n\nThe United States, whose contribution accounts for more than 80 percent of those funds, has conditioned their release on the findings of a U. N. investigation. Israel has not publicly detailed its claims about the employees or officially shared the allegations and supporting evidence with UNRWA, according to the United Nations.\n\nThere is no clear alternative to UNRWA in Gaza, where more than 28,000 people have been killed during the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The World Food Program said in late December that 9 in 10 people were living on less than one meal a day. Some families have resorted to eating animal feed, and many are drinking dirty water. Now, Israel has warned it is planning a military operation in Rafah, home to some 1.4 million displaced Gazans who have nowhere else to go.\n\nThe European Union, UNRWA’s third-largest donor, announced last month that it would not cut funding but called for an audit of the group by E. U.  experts. It’s unclear whether the review can be completed before the bloc is scheduled to make its next $88 million payment at the end of this month.\n\n“The fact that people are on the move constantly with multiple displacements, with very patchy telecommunications, would make it difficult to have the kind of frequency of contact that any piece of work requires, let alone an investigation of this magnitude,” she said.\n\nUNRWA was founded in 1949 to support Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes during the establishment of Israel. Over the decades, the agency has taken on many functions of a state, running schools, medical centers and food assistance programs in Palestinian refugee camps that have become urban slums — not only in Gaza and the occupied West Bank but also in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.\n\nIsraeli authorities demanded last week that “responsible” U. N. agencies take on UNRWA’s mission in Gaza, echoing a long-standing demand by some Israeli politicians to dismantle the agency. But no other U.N. group operates at the scale of UNRWA or has the ability to ramp up operations to replace it, Alrifai said. And agencies cannot unilaterally change the mandate given to them by the U.N. General Assembly.\n\n“Who will give us guarantees that none of us will be persecuted under any pretext that Israel and the world deem inconsistent with their standards?” said one 27-year employee, speaking to The Post on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",

  "text": "Much of the 45-minute conversation focused on a proposal for an extended humanitarian pause in the Israel-Hamas war that would allow the release of hostages still held by the militant group, according to a senior administration official.\n\nProtection of civilians in Gaza “is a constant discussion between us and the Israelis,” even as Biden shares Israel’s goal of defeating Hamas, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nHow civilians would be spared from an Israeli offensive in the southernmost city in Gaza “is a huge question,” the official said. Most of those in Rafah have moved there to avoid fighting elsewhere in the enclave. They live in makeshift shelters and are almost totally supported by the trickle of humanitarian aid that is allowed to transit via the Egyptian border.\n\n“The president and the prime minister had a pretty detailed back and forth on that. I think our position on it is very clear,” the official said. The United States would not support such an operation unless Israel has a plan for civilian protection and sustenance “that was actually planned, prepared and implementable.”\n\nIn his strongest public statement to date, Biden told reporters Thursday that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which local health officials said has caused nearly 28,000 deaths, has been “over the top.” Sunday’s conversation was the first between the two leaders since Jan. 19.\n\nHours before his phone call with Biden, Netanyahu told ABC’s “This Week” that Israel was “doing everything we can to minimize civilian casualties. … But one thing we’re not going to do is we’re not going to let Hamas emerge victorious.”\n\nAsked how and where Israel proposed to care for and move more than a million people to safety from Rafah, Netanyahu pointed to “the areas that we’ve cleared, north of Rafah — plenty of areas there. But we are working out a detailed plan to do so.”\n\n“Those who are saying that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying, lose the war. Keep Hamas there,” Netanyahu said. Israel has said that senior Hamas leaders have moved their operations to southern Gaza to escape Israeli attacks.\n\nThe phone call between the leaders came in advance of CIA Director William J. Burns’s trip to Cairo on Tuesday to continue negotiations with Egypt and Qatar on implementing a framework proposal for a pause in the fighting to enable the release of hostages Hamas is still holding inside Gaza. The proposal, sent two weeks ago to both sides in the conflict, calls for a six-week cease-fire that would allow civilian hostages to be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and a significant increase in humanitarian aid.\n\nThe United States hopes is that the initial pause would build momentum for extensions allowing for the release of all hostages, including Israeli military personnel as well as the bodies of more than two dozen of about 1,200 people who were killed by the Hamas fighters who invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, sparking the current war.\n\n“The framework is pretty much in place,” the senior administration official said. “There are certainly gaps that need to be closed. Some of them are significant. But there has been real progress over the last few weeks and we’re now seeking to do all we possibly can to capitalize on it.”\n\nHamas’s response to the proposal, transmitted to negotiators last week, called for thousands of Palestinian prisoners to be released, including some with lengthy sentences for significant crimes. It also insisted that Israel withdraw all its troops from Gaza before discussions on a second-phase release could begin. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Tel Aviv at the time, called some of Hamas’s demands “non-starters,” but said that the response had provided “space” to work with.\n\nDespite Netanyahu’s publicly negative response to the proposal, “the framework is not rejected,” the senior official said. “There are gaps that have to close and some of the differences are significant. … But compared to where we were a month ago, to now, there really has been significant progress.”\n\nSketching the paradoxical relationship between a potential Israeli ground offensive in Rafah and the prospects for fighting pause, the official said, “You will not get a hostage deal unless Hamas is under significant pressure. … It is something the Israelis tell us all the time. It’s something that we agree with.”",

Israelis in their teens and 20s began occupying the crossing on Wednesday to stop the delivery of humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave. (Lorenzo Tugnoli for The Washington Post)KEREM SHALOM, Israel — It’s approaching 1 a.m. Yosef de Bresser, 22, is in the thick of planning. He fields calls from the car as it zips along dirt roads just outside southern Gaza near Egypt.He taps out a WhatsApp message to rally more: “We sleep tonight in Kerem Shalom and block aid and fuel to Hamas! Do you want to sleep here with us? Shuttles are running throughout the night and day.”Before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and the war that ensued, Kerem Shalom was the main commercial crossing between Israel and Gaza. Today, it’s one of just two entry points for lifesaving food and medicine to the besieged enclave, where aid agencies say civilians are on the brink of famine.But De Bresser and his three companions are determined to keep any trucks from getting through, and they aren’t bothered if innocents suffer: “War is war,” De Bresser shrugs. The United States didn’t care about civilians when it blew up Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “Who gives his enemy aid?”Scrawny and wearing an inside-out T-shirt, De Bresser appears an unlikely leader. But he has credentials. He has lived in Yitzhar, a settlement in the West Bank notorious for its violence against neighboring Palestinians, and has been arrested a dozen times, including during demonstrations backing Israel’s contentious judicial overhaul.Tattooed on his neck is a fist raised against a blue Star of David, the emblem of the Jewish Defense League, founded in New York by the extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane and designated by the FBI a terrorist organization. The group launched bombings against Palestinian and Arab targets in the 1970s and ’80s but is now largely inactive.“He’s old-school,” explains Bnayahu Ben Shabat, 23, a friend of De Bresser’s, before they set out on their journey. Ben Shabat is in charge of special projects for Im Tirtzu, a right-wing Zionist organization.Special projects such as the one they have in store this early Wednesday morning.De Bresser and Ben Shabat have been protesting the aid for several weeks. Camping is a new idea.The Israel Defense Forces — ostensibly, at least — have made Kerem Shalom a closed military zone since late January. But there are no checkpoints at night, making it easier to bring in busloads of protesters. Still, Ben Shabat wants to take the winding roads through the farmland, to stay on the right side of the court order that bans him from some parts of the area.When the group finally reaches the crossing, a motor coach full of campers is already waiting.A lone police car sits just inside the open gates, its blue and red lights flashing. But teenagers inside are unperturbed, streaming off the coach and through the open gates, screaming with excitement.Inside, they shake hands with soldiers and begin to line up their tents.Skip to end of carouselIsrael’s military said it rescued two hostages from the southern Gazan city of Rafah early Monday while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza’s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people. President Biden and Jordan’s King Abdullah II warned against an indiscriminate Israeli invasion of Rafah.For context: Understand what’s behind the Israel-Gaza war.Secretary of State Antony Blinken, visiting this month, called on Israel to ensure the passage of aid for Gaza through Kerem Shalom. But there’s no apparent effort here to stop the teens.One asks a soldier if he can drive his car into the crossing point. The soldier says it’s fine by him but he’s not sure whether the police will stop him. “I don’t think they will,” he says. “Good luck. Turn on your lights.”A voice over a loudspeaker instructs protesters to grab sleeping bags and tents. “Welcome to whoever came,” It says. “Champions — really, champions.”At 3 a.m., Tahel Attar, 17, offers around soup. “The army is with us, the police is with us,” she says. “They don’t want us to be here, but they get it. They let us. We are talking with them, we are having fun with them, we are offering them everything they need.”Some pose with soldiers for a picture. “Am Yisreal Chai!” they yell. The people of Israel live.The boom of an explosion inside Gaza reaches the camp. Cheers and whoops go up. Rafah, the border town where Israel has said it is mounting a new assault, is less than five miles away.“The gate is open! You can get by car right to the crossing (just move the car far afterwards).” Trucks will be blocked. “Triumph!”The teens, and a smattering of people in their 20s, have come from all over Israel. They say that humanitarian aid to Gaza helps Hamas, and they’ll block it even if it means innocents starve.Ben Shabat argues sugar and flour can be used to make bombs. “When you mix flour with potassium nitrate you get an explosive for a warhead,” he says. “Every pound of sugar and flour that goes into Gaza from Israel, we will get it back by the way of a rocket that will kill our children.”The tactic is also about starvation. “When a soldier is hungry, he’s not fighting so well.”And the children? “Nobody can say children are bad,” he says. But “the children from the past were murdering and raping and kidnapping” on Oct. 7.Others say the aid isn’t even necessary.“We heard they are giving them stuff that they don’t really, really need,” Attar says. “Like strawberries. I don’t think people there are crying for strawberries.”The Post's Loveday Morris saw Israeli protesters at Israel-Gaza's Kerem Shalom border crossing on Feb. 7 blocking trucks from bringing aid into the Gaza Strip. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)In Gaza, families are eating animal feed to survive. Ninety-three percent of the population of over 2 million faces “crisis levels of hunger,” a U.N.-backed consortium reported in late December.Hadas Kremer, a 17-year-old with curly blond hair from the Orthodox settlement of Otniel near Hebron, explains that Palestinians who are unhappy and hungry in Gaza should leave. Israel pays for them to exit, she says. In reality, the vast majority of Gazans have no way to flee.With dawn comes a new busload of demonstrators, ultra-Orthodox children and teens from northern Israel. They strap on their tefillin and pray. Some dance. A group with a guitar sing songs about the military. They use the border crossing bathrooms. No one asks them to leave.“Dead, dead, dead Arabs,” one camper shouts at a roaring volley of outgoing fire. Then she notes the presence of a reporter. “Hamas,” she corrects herself.In the morning, aid trucks stretch along the Israeli border with Egypt. Amid a sudden panic that deliveries might be allowed to enter through a gate normally used as an exit, the protesters shifted their tents.Israeli soldiers look on. “Man, don’t you feel don’t you feel like shooting off a round over there?” asks one demonstrator, looking out toward Egypt.“I don’t want them to shoot you,” the soldier replies. “You are more important.”But the new position of some of the tents appears more irksome to the Israeli military. At 10 a.m., a group of high-ranking officers arrives. Among them is Brig. Gen. Yossi Bachar, a former chief of the general staff, now a reservist.“We will leave here when there is a video of General Yossi Bachar saying not one truck will pass though this gate today,” De Bresser says. The demonstrators are assured that no goods will be allowed to enter as long as they move back from the border fence.They do so. The trucks idle.The IDF referred questions on why the protesters were allowed to remain at the crossing to COGAT, the Defense Ministry agency that oversees Palestinian civil affairs and crossing points. COGAT did not respond to requests for comment. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said it could not provide data on how many trucks have been disrupted at the crossing. The office does not have a presence at the border point.By early afternoon on Wednesday, many teens have left for school and family. Still, the dozen or so children who remain, with a smattering of adults, manage to keep any aid for entering Gaza.A group of kids who moved barbed wire and a log to form a barrier in front of their tents begins to turn back.Earlier demonstrators had “folded” and gone home, said De Bresser. But he vows to stay on. Police tried to evacuate the camp on Thursday, organizers said, but protesters returned, blocking the crossing for another day on Friday.On Saturday, De Bresser put out a new appeal on WhatsApp.“All the people of Israel should come and support!”Judith Sudilovsky in Jerusalem contributed to this report.Israel-Gaza war: Israel’s military said it rescued two hostages from the southern Gazan city of Rafah while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza’s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people.

  "text": "Israel’s military said it rescued two hostages and carried out a series of strikes in southern Gaza in the early hours Monday local time, sparking confusion and panic in Rafah, where more than 1 million people have fled to escape conflict elsewhere in the Palestinian enclave. The two hostages, Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Luis Har, 70, were taken from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak on Oct. 7, Israel’s military said, adding that both were in “good medical condition” and were taken for further medical examination in Israel.\n\nThe early-morning strikes came hours after President Biden stressed during a weekend phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that there should be no military operation in Rafah unless there are plans in place to protect civilians. Israel has faced increasing pressure from allies and neighbors to halt plans for what it described as a massive operation there.\n\nPressed on the question of where Palestinian civilians staying in Rafah should go, Netanyahu referred vaguely to “plenty of areas” north of the city. Gaza — which is wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea — is just 25 miles long and about 6 miles wide, and much of it has been destroyed or remains an active conflict zone.\n\nMore than 1 million people have sought shelter in Rafah in recent weeks, including in sprawling tent camps, after fleeing intense Israeli bombardment elsewhere in Gaza. Overcrowding has forced families to sleep in the streets, and food is so scarce that some people have resorted to eating grass, the anti-poverty group ActionAid International said in a statement.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron also weighed in over the weekend, saying he was “deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah.” E. U. foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf and Germany’s Foreign Ministry all warned that a ground incursion there would be catastrophic for the population.\n\nConcerns are mounting in Cairo that an Israeli offensive in Rafah would add to pressure on Egypt to open its border to Palestinian refugees — an outcome it has sought to avoid since the start of the war, fearing insecurity in Sinai, a sensitive military zone, and not wanting to be seen by its staunchly pro-Palestinian public as complicit in mass displacement.\n\nHamas said that an Israeli offensive in Rafah could threaten hostage exchange negotiations, Hamas’s media outlet quoted an official in the militant organization as saying. A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Thursday to carry on negotiations convened by Egypt and Qatar, aimed at reaching a cease-fire deal in Gaza that would involve the freeing of Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\n\nIsrael targeted a senior Hamas figure deep inside Lebanese territory in a strike on Saturday, according to an Israeli security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. The target, Hamas recruiter Basel Saleh, survived the attack, but at least two others were killed, the official said.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had uncovered a tunnel used by Hamas that passes beneath the main Gaza City headquarters of UNRWA. The head of the aid group, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement that Israel had not formally notified the agency about the discovery and that UNRWA was not aware of any tunnel infrastructure under the compound, which was evacuated on Oct. 12. The organization has been in crisis since Israel’s accusation that about a dozen of its employees played a role in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nOne in every 100 people in Gaza was killed in the first 100 days of the war, a rate higher than any other armed conflict in the 21st century, according to a U. N. commission. “The ongoing war stands out as unprecedented in the scale of death, destruction, and suffering, with repercussions that will echo for generations to come,” said the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.\n\nThe body of Hind Rajab, the 6-year-old missing for 12 days since losing touch with rescue workers after her family car was fired on in Gaza, has been found, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Saturday. The ambulance dispatched to reach her was also shelled, and the two paramedics inside were killed. Hind, the sole survivor of the attack in Gaza City, reached emergency dispatchers by phone on Jan. 29 and begged for hours to be rescued.",

  "text": "The strike, which Lebanese state media said was carried out by drone, hit a vehicle in the Lebanese village of Jadra, about 40 miles north of the border with Israel. Two people were killed, according to Jadra’s mayor, Joseph Azzi, who said the blast from the attack was caught by surveillance cameras at a nearby gas station. One of the fatalities was a member of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the militant group said in a statement.\n\nSaleh, who is responsible for Hamas recruitment in the occupied West Bank, was “injured to an unknown extent” in the attack, the Israeli official said. He worked alongside Azzam al-Akra, a senior member of Hamas’s armed wing, who was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Beirut in early January, according to the official.\n\nThe attack on Saturday came as Iran’s foreign minister visited Beirut, meeting with top Lebanese officials and Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah. Tehran is a key ally and backer of Hezbollah, which has been engaged in low-level conflict with Israel since the war in Gaza started on Oct. 7.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that a “massive operation” was needed in Rafah to eradicate Hamas. He said he ordered the Israel Defense Forces to draw up a plan to remove the civilian population from the area, where more than 1 million people are now sheltering after fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in Gaza, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe rights group Amnesty International said that if the removal order is enacted, it “may amount to the crime of forcible transfer.” U. N. and other humanitarian officials warn that Palestinians crammed into Rafah have nowhere else to go.\n\nIf people are forced to flee north, where there is widespread destruction, they will end up returning “to devastated areas that are littered with dangerous explosive devices and are virtually uninhabitable,” Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, chief executive of the aid group Mercy Corps, said in a statement.\n\nAid agencies are already struggling to address the sprawling humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which is now seeing “concerning rates of acute malnutrition” among children, according to the U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nIsrael has also taken aim at the main U. N. organization providing services in Gaza, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which it says is open to exploitation by Hamas.\n\nOn Saturday, the Israeli military said it had uncovered a tunnel that passes beneath UNRWA’s main headquarters in Gaza City and was used by Hamas. The military showed journalists from the Associated Press and other outlets what it said was an electrical supply hub powering tunnel infrastructure in the area.\n\nUNRWA’s commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, said Saturday in a statement that his agency was not aware of any tunnel infrastructure under the compound, which staff evacuated on Oct. 12, and that Israel had not formally notified UNRWA about the discovery. The agency, he said, inspects the grounds every quarter, “but does not have the military and security expertise nor the capacity to undertake military inspections of what is or might be under its premises.”\n\nLast month, Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA employees of playing a role in the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 and shared some of its findings with the United States and other foreign governments that help fund the agency. The allegations prompted multiple countries, including the United States, to suspend funding, plunging the organization into crisis.\n\nThe body of Hind Rajab, the 6-year-old missing for 12 days since losing touch with rescue workers after her family car was fired on in Gaza, was found, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Saturday. The ambulance dispatched to reach her was also shelled and the two paramedics inside were killed. Hind, the sole survivor of the attack in Gaza City, reached emergency dispatchers by phone on Jan. 29 and begged for hours to be rescued.\n\nMoody’s downgraded Israel’s credit rating Friday and changed its outlook for the country to negative, citing the war with Hamas and reflecting the ratings agency’s concern that the conflict could become a long-term economic burden. Moody’s downgraded Israel’s rating from A1 to A2, which is still in a category it considers “low credit risk.”\n\nCIA Director William J. Burns is expected to travel to Cairo on Tuesday to continue negotiations over the proposed hostage release deal, with U. S. officials hoping Israel will respond to Hamas’s latest proposal, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks. The official said that Hamas’s proposal, which it delivered to negotiators earlier this week, has “real problems” but that the administration believes there is a broad enough framework in place to facilitate an agreement.",

  "text": "Four years ago, the Trump administration found itself in a predicament similar to the one now faced by his successor: How does a president respond to provocations by Iran without starting an all-out war?In the first days of 2020, Iran fired a barrage of missiles at an Iraqi air base housing U. S. troops. The attack did not kill any Americans, but it marked the first time Iran had directly targeted a U.S. position in the Middle East amid decades of tensions. The strike came after the United States killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who the Trump administration said was orchestrating attacks against Americans.\n\nThis month, Iranian-backed militias struck a U. S. outpost in Jordan, killing three American soldiers. President Biden said he has decided how the United States will respond but did not disclose further information. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that the U.S. response “won’t just be a one-off.”\n\nIt appears that the United States and Iran — both then and now — do not want a wider war, with the Middle East on tenterhooks amid Israel’s war in Gaza. But a series of attacks, tit-for-tat strikes and skirmishes initiated by militant groups from Lebanon to Yemen has raised fears that wider conflict could embroil the region.\n\nThe 2020 attacks on the al-Asad air base and another facility in Irbil had raised fears that the United States, under an often erratic Trump administration, would respond with actions that could ignite an enduring conflict. After the killing of Soleimani, President Donald Trump warned that any Iranian response would be met with a forceful one by the United States. He wrote on Twitter that he had identified 52 targets in Iran, including cultural sites, that would be “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.”\n\nBut even as Trump spewed fiery threats, his administration was attempting to stave off reprisals from Iran that could have spun things out of control. The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States sent messages in the days after the assassination to Iran, via the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, urging it not to escalate things further.\n\n“Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,” Trump said in an address at the time. Trump also imposed additional sanctions on Iran’s economy, a go-to nonmilitary tactic for many recent administrations.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif, then Iran’s foreign minister, wrote that “Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense,” referring to Iran’s retaliatory strikes on U. S. installations in Iraq. “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.”\n\nAs fears of war faded, Trump held up the assassination of Soleimani as a victory, but he did not follow up with a broader military or economic strategy, which the United States has not had since the Reagan administration, said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\n\n“The question today is, did Iran stand down?” Vatanka said of the four years since. He noted that Iran has maintained its two pillars of belief that the United States should be run out of the Middle East, and that the state of Israel should not exist.\n\nIt was not clear whether the Biden administration was pursuing similar back-channel communications with Iran; the two countries do not have diplomatic relations, complicating confidential dialogue. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said Wednesday that he did not “have any private communications with Iran to speak to.”\n\nThe situation in 2020 was also different: a sharp escalation in hostilities following the surprise assassination, versus a steady drumbeat of attacks by Iranian-backed groups on Biden’s watch, Vatanka said. Iran has “never been this close to pushing an American president knowingly with his eyes open into a conflict,” he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iranian Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, appeared to shy away from further escalation. “We are not looking for war, but we are not afraid of it either,” he said, as reported by the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. “We are not warmongers, but we defend ourselves and our glory.”\n\nIt remains to be seen how Biden will respond to the deaths of the three U. S. troops. Administration officials have suggested in recent days that the U.S. response will be enduring, rather than a one-time strike.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday said that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella set of militias that includes the group Kataib Hezbollah, was responsible for the attack in Jordan. Kataib Hezbollah backed down this week, a move that was reportedly ordered by Iran, which analysts say is seeking to distance itself from the attack.",

  "text": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet when the country’s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington’s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nEgypt also believed a deal had been reached with the United States and Israel to open the crossing for almost five hours on Monday, to allow 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza and foreign passport holders to leave the strip, according to a person with knowledge of Egyptian diplomatic efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n“If we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,” said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. “It fell in the sand,” he said. “If it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.”\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration’s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East — essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation’s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIsraeli officials said Monday that  the military was holding a number of gunmen that it captured during the attack. The Israel Defense Forces was also reviewing body-camera footage taken from some of the prisoners, as well as from slain Hamas fighters, giving the army more insight into their movements, planning and communications, Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza.",

  "text": "The vow is “til death do us part.” But for former Dutch prime minister Dries van Agt and his wife, Eugenie, the aim was to leave this life the same way they had spent the past seven decades — together. The couple, both 93, died “hand in hand” earlier this month, according to a statement from the Rights Forum, a pro-Palestinian organization that Dries van Agt created. They chose to die by what is known as “duo euthanasia” — a growing trend in the Netherlands, where a small number of couples have been granted their wish to die in unison in recent years, usually by a lethal dose of a drug.\n\nA longtime politician who had conservative roots but campaigned for numerous liberal causes, van Agt served as prime minister of the Netherlands from 1977 to 1982. He later became the European Union’s ambassador to Japan and the United States.\n\nPhotos of the couple from their decades-long careers as public figures often show them walking in step: waving to crowds through a car window, voting together at an election site and giving each other a smooch at a public event.\n\nThe van Agts’ health had declined in recent years, Dutch public broadcaster NOS reported. The former prime minister never fully recovered after suffering a brain hemorrhage in 2019, which happened while he was delivering a speech at a commemoration event for Palestinians. Eugenie’s health issues were largely kept private.\n\n“I feel like it’s kind of beautiful, honestly, that you’ve lived your life together, you both happen to be gravely ill without a chance of getting better, you’re ready to go, and you would like to go together,” said Maria Carpiac, director of the gerontology program at California State University at Long Beach.\n\nWhen it comes to the right to choose one’s own death, the Netherlands is “kind of the model” for any U. S. legislation on the topic, she said.\n\nAt least 29 couples — or 58 people — died together via duo euthanasia in 2022, the most recent year of data from the country’s Regional Euthanasia Review Committees. That’s more than double the 13 couples who did so in 2020, when the committee first started looking at partners specifically, but it still represents only a small fraction of the 8,720 people who legally died by euthanasia or assisted suicide in the Netherlands that year.\n\n“It is likely that this will happen more and more often,” said Rob Edens, press officer for NVVE, a Dutch organization focused on research, lobbying and education about assisted suicide and euthanasia in the Netherlands. “We still see a reluctance among doctors to provide euthanasia based on an accumulation of age-related conditions. But it is permitted” in the country’s legal guidelines, he said in an email.\n\nAssisted suicide is when a person self-administers a lethal dose while a physician is present, while euthanasia is when a medical professional administers the dose. Both are legal in the Netherlands when specific criteria are met. (Some groups prefer the term “medical aid in dying,” or MAID, due to religious and social stigma around suicide.)\n\nThe Netherlands, a country of almost 18 million people, has allowed assisted suicide and euthanasia since 2002. It requires that individuals willingly request the termination of their life in a manner that is “well-considered,” with a sign-off from a doctor that they are experiencing “unbearable suffering with no prospect of improvement.”\n\nAnother physician then has to agree that the person qualifies, and doctors can choose whether they are involved in the procedure. After every death, doctors are required to notify a regional review committee, which examines whether each case was handled lawfully. Couples who seek duo euthanasia are required to apply and undergo the review process individually, with separate doctors.\n\n“An accumulation of age-related complaints can lead to unbearable and hopeless suffering,” Edens said, explaining the Dutch guidelines. “The expectation is that if doctors are increasingly willing to provide euthanasia when there is an accumulation of old-age complaints, the number of duo euthanasia [cases] will increase.”\n\nResearch suggests that older Americans are at a higher risk of dying after losing a spouse, particularly in the first few months after their death. While the cause of this phenomenon is unclear, studies have found that grieving partners have higher rates of inflammation and are at increased risk of heart attack and stroke, often due to stress-induced changes in blood pressure, heart rate and blood clotting.\n\n“The first thing that came to my mind was the widowhood effect,” Carpiac said, referring to the van Agts’ choice to die by duo euthanasia. “I have a grandmother who is 96, and she’s like, ‘I’m not going anywhere!’ But if I had a partner and they were my person, and we were both kind of at the end of our lives, would it be worth it if he were to go without me? Would I die of what I considered to be a broken heart? I would want to have a choice.”",

  "text": "More than 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip have been released since they were taken in the cross-border Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Estimates for the total number of hostages seized in the attack that left at least 1,200 people dead in Israel have shifted over the course of the war. As of Wednesday, an estimated 107 living hostages remain in captivity in Gaza, according to numbers provided by Israel, but the country has not given the full basis for its estimates.\n\nA deal between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar, paused the fighting on Nov. 24 and allowed for the release of women and children in exchange for Palestinian women and teens in Israeli prisons. However, fighting restarted Dec. 1, with Israeli warplanes resuming strikes in Gaza.\n\nDuring the pause, 81 Israeli citizens — including those who also hold citizenship from other countries — were released. Under the deal’s framework, every Israeli hostage freed would initiate the release of three Palestinian prisoners. Outside the framework of the exchange deal, 24 foreign nationals — who do not hold Israeli citizenship — were freed. Before the deal, some hostages — including two Americans — were also released or rescued.\n\nThe specific number of hostages who have died in captivity and the ages, genders and nationalities of those remaining in Gaza are unclear. Israel has estimated that the majority of those remaining have Israeli citizenship and are male. It’s unclear how many are members of the Israeli military. Two Americans — Abigail Edan, 4, and Liat Beinin Atzili, 49 — were released under the exchange deal. Fewer than 10 U. S. citizens are now held hostage, according to the White House.\n\nWhile Hamas is thought to hold most of the hostages, some are believed to be held by other militant groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose fighters also took part in the Oct. 7 attack. Israel blames Hamas for the deaths of some hostages and said three were killed in its own operations; Hamas says Israeli strikes have killed some hostages. The Washington Post could not independently verify either side’s claims.\n\nHere is a list of the hostages released and what is known about those who remain.",

  "text": "Gazans living in the overcrowded border city of Rafah are attempting to flee ahead of an expected military operation by Israeli forces, despite uncertainty about where to go next and dwindling resources.“We’ve been living in a state of terror for about a week now,” Anwaar al-Rai, 48, said in an interview Tuesday. Rai, who was traveling with her husband Mahmoud al-Rai, 49, and their two daughters, said she and her husband had been reaching out to everyone they knew in the western areas of Gaza’s central region, north of Khan Younis. “We urgently need a safe haven,” she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called last week for a “massive operation” in Rafah, citing the need to “collapse” remaining Hamas militant units in the last remaining refuge in Gaza. Israeli strikes in the city on Monday, part of what Israel said was an operation to rescue hostages, have added to the fears in Rafah. The strikes killed at least 67 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly warned against any military operation in Rafah if it puts civilians at risk. President Biden said Monday that Israel must have “a credible plan to ensure the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there.”\n\nRafah was previously one of Gaza’s last refuges, swelling to an estimated 1.4 million in population by early February, more than five times its prewar size. Many of those displaced have ended up in sprawling tent encampments on the city’s edges. The Washington Post spoke to several Gazans in Rafah who said they were trying to head north to Gaza’s central region, even though the Israeli military previously ordered the evacuation of that area.\n\nShadi Asaad, 32, said he was scouring charitable institutions in Rafah with his father, desperately seeking an additional tent. “I made the decision to move my family to the Deir al-Balah area,” Asaad said in an interview Tuesday, referring to part of the central region. “But with just one tent at our disposal, we require at least another.”\n\nTents have been provided free by charitable organizations. However, they are now being sold on the market for exorbitant prices and can fetch up to $1,000 each.\n\nRami Muhammad, 32, and his wife Najwa, along with their two children, found themselves displaced from their apartment near Qarara, north of Khan Younis, after the property owner sought refuge from Rafah. Muhammad and his family are now sharing a makeshift tent in Zawaida, farther north in the Deir al-Balah region.\n\nCIA Director William J. Burns and Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea met Tuesday in Egypt in a continued effort to negotiate a possible hostage-release deal. U. S. officials are hopeful that Israel will have a counter to Hamas’s latest proposal, and they believe that “the shape” of an agreement “is coming together,” a senior U.S. administration official said earlier.\n\nTwo Israelis were injured by rocket fire in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona, near the border with Lebanon, according to Israeli emergency services. A 15-year-old boy and a 47-year-old woman were wounded amid fire  between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, but is unusual for civilians to be targeted.\n\nThe South African government made an “urgent request” to the International Court of Justice to consider whether Israel’s planned offensive in Rafah requires the court to use its power to prevent a “further imminent breach of the rights of Palestinians in Gaza.” South Africa brought a landmark genocide case against Israel in December; in an initial ruling, the ICJ ordered Israel to do more to prevent the killing of civilians but did not call for a cease-fire.\n\nAt least 28,473 people have been killed and 68,146 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack.",

  "text": "Beset by devastating floods, Venice erected an engineering marvel of metallic barricades that can rise and lower in its inlets to protect the palazzos, piazzas and churches. Now, responding to residents’ fears that Venice is becoming a glorified water park, this lagoon city that has drawn awestruck visitors since the Middle Ages is seeking to become a laboratory for how to deal with a modern ill: tourists inundating Instagrammable destinations from Savannah, Ga., to Hallstatt, Austria.\n\nA 29-day test, set to start on April 25 after a series of delays, will require day-trippers to book and pay admission to set foot on Venice’s core island. City officials note that tourists worldwide have long paid entry fees for museums, archaeological sites, even churches, with more-popular sites turning to visitor caps or time slots. This system, they say, is a mild version of those.\n\nIf deemed a success, the new fees — initially set at 5 euros, equal to $5.38 — would continue to apply on certain days, officials say, especially in high season, when tourists can outnumber locals by 3 to 1. Overnight visitors, who already pay a tourist tax at hotels, would be exempt.\n\nAnother experimental measure, starting in August, will limit tour groups to 25 people. That follows a cruise ship ban in place since 2021 that prevents massive ships from sailing past St. Mark’s Square through the Giudecca Canal and docking at the historic city center — though they can still make port nearby. Venice has also banned new souvenir shops on the city’s main arteries, and new hotels now require an official vote in city hall.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, video feeds coming into an observation center at police headquarters showed tourists threading through narrow alleys. A network of cameras and sensors helps alert police to overcrowding. In three screen-filled rooms, officers can count the number of tourists in different areas and even assess where they might be from by analyzing the origins of their cellphone accounts.\n\nThe number of overnight visitors hit an all-time high of more than 3.5 million last year. Day-trippers — who spend far fewer euros — number an estimated 10 million annually, although that could include people who visit more than once. Meanwhile, the year-round population of Venice’s core island has fallen to fewer than 50,000 people — below the total number of beds in hotels and short-term rentals.\n\nAlthough the pandemic’s halt to global tourism dented wallets here, it also provided Venetians with a dreamy glimpse of a world in which their city was once again their own. Last year, as visitor numbers bounced back, the city also received a wake-up call. UNESCO experts recommended that Venice be added to a “List of World Heritage in Danger” — a potential PR nightmare for the mayor’s office. Among the reasons: the city’s inability to control mass tourism.\n\n“But that’s not to say they’re off the hook,” said Peter Debrine, a senior project officer with UNESCO, the arts, culture and sciences body of United Nations. “I think the committee wants to see how these efforts go.”\n\nPreservationists describe the fee for day-trippers as too little too late, noting that the 5-euro price of admission is less than the cost of a cappuccino on St. Mark’s Square. They call it political theater, designed to give the impression of curbing visitors, and thus appease UNESCO, without offending the powerful business lobbies in Venice that live and die on tourism.\n\nA genuine effort, they say, would involve far steeper pricing or outright caps, and see Venice follow in the footsteps of Florence and other cities in Europe and the United States that have sought to limit short-term rentals on platforms such as Airbnb.\n\nOfficials say they are trying to make major events like Carnival less oppressive for locals, reinventing it since the pandemic, for instance, as a more “diffused” celebration. More shows are now been held away from the main stage. To reduce crowds in St. Mark’s Square, organizers have also done away with the Flight of the Angel, a spectacle with roots in the 16th century in which an elaborately outfitted performer zip-lined from the Bell Tower.\n\nVenice’s Carnival, a celebration of transgression and vice performed with the aid of masks, dates to the Middle Ages. Though meant to be a great equalizer for rich and poor, it became an attraction for royals and aristocrats across Europe, tempting the city early on with the power of tourist coin. After a long dormancy, locals rekindled the tradition in late 1970s and early 1980s, then watched its transformation into the highly commercial event — and international draw — it is today.",

  "text": "You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday. Former president Donald Trump’s latest rhetorical grenade shook the West’s preeminent military alliance. Over the weekend, he said he would encourage Russia to attack U.S. allies in NATO if they failed to invest enough on their national defense. The remarks, as well as separate comments about ending U.S. aid to foreign countries, “set off fresh tremors across Washington and in European countries already worried about America’s reliability as an ally in a potential second Trump administration,” my colleagues reported.\n\nTrump has long grumbled about the United States’ outsize role in NATO and casts President Biden’s support for Ukraine’s struggle to resist Russian invasion as a costly drag on the U. S. taxpayer. The sentiment has captured a segment of the Republican Party, which has blocked the Biden administration’s attempts to earmark some $61 billion in fresh funding for Ukraine.\n\nTo European onlookers, Trump’s stated hostility is a line in the sand. “Everyone should watch this video from Trump and then understand that Europe may soon have no choice but to defend itself,” Norbert Röttgen, a senior German lawmaker and former chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German parliament, wrote on his Facebook page. “We have to manage this because anything else would be surrender and self-abandonment!”\n\nTrump, in the eyes of some European critics, is an existential threat to the Western alliance and its political ethos. “The current presidential campaign only confirms that he has not changed his reckless attitude towards allies,” Marko Mihkelson, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Estonian Parliament, told my colleagues. “Unfortunately, he is therefore a very convenient tool for Putin’s Russia, which is waging war against the West.”\n\n“Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U. S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n\nDuring his term, Biden reinvigorated the transatlantic alliance, assuring European counterparts about U. S. commitments to their security while coordinating a robust, collective effort to support Kyiv. European diplomats in Washington barely disguise their confidence and trust in the Biden administration, and their apprehensions of what may come should Trump defeat him in November.\n\nBut on the other key battlefront in the global conversation, Biden has unsettled myriad political elites with his perceived complicity in Israel’s relentless war against Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli campaign, which has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, many of whom were children, took another deadly turn Monday with the expansion of operations in Rafah, a southern city along the territory’s border with Egypt that’s now hosting more than a million cornered Gazan refugees.\n\nBiden is reportedly frustrated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s uncompromising approach to the conflict. But has resisted internal pressure from aides and Democratic allies to do more to restrain the Israeli campaign — which came after militant group Hamas’s invasion on southern Israel on Oct. 7 — let alone condition future military aid to the Jewish state.\n\n“Biden, who aides say has a visceral attachment to the Jewish state, has tended to view the prime minister and the state of Israel as one and the same, according to several people familiar with his thinking, and has struggled with the idea of criticizing a sitting prime minister, particularly during a time of war,” my colleagues reported.\n\nEven Europe’s top diplomat offered a thinly veiled rebuke of Biden’s muddled stance. “How many times have you heard the most prominent leaders and foreign ministers around the world saying too many people are being killed?” E. U. foreign policy Josep Borrell told reporters Monday, gesturing to Biden’s recent remarks that Israel’s conduct of the war was “over the top.”\n\n“If the international community believes that this is a slaughter, that too many people are being killed, maybe we have to think about the provision of arms,” Borrell added.\n\nBut Biden and many of his European counterparts have largely ignored calls from protesters and some lawmakers in their own countries to force a cease-fire or take action to thwart Israel’s latest offensive in Rafah. Also unheeded was an injunction from the International Court of Justice, the U. N.'s highest court, requiring Israel to take steps to better protect civilian life in Gaza. Some U.N. officials already believe Israel is in breach of those demands.\n\nAccording to a U. N. commission, one in every 100 people in Gaza was killed in the first 100 days of the war, a rate higher than any other armed conflict in the 21st century. “The ongoing war stands out as unprecedented in the scale of death, destruction, and suffering, with repercussions that will echo for generations to come,” noted the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.\n\nThe toll of the conflict has turned public opinion against Israel in much of the world. It has also sparked fury at Israel’s perceived Western enablers, chiefly the United States, for their selective approach to the “rules-based international order.” Biden has anchored this concept at the heart of why he claims the United States must defend Ukraine, arguing that Putin cannot be allowed to show that might makes right.\n\n“The Arab and Muslim world has lost faith in perceived Western norms: international law and institutions, human rights, and democratic values,” wrote Mohamed ElBaradei, former Egyptian diplomat and former head of the U. N.'s atomic agency, in a column last month. “In their view, the West itself is showing that brute force trumps all else.”\n\nThe stakes are arguably as high, perhaps higher, than what Europe is weighing when it comes to its future collective security. If the rules-based international order “publicly fails once again,” suggested Renad Mansour of Britain’s Chatham House think tank, “by proving incapable of agreeing an end to the unprecedented bloodshed in Gaza, it will further undermine the world’s faith in the institutions that were built to serve it, and possibly contribute to its complete unraveling. Western leaders should think very hard about this historic moment and what might come next.”",

  "text": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet when the country’s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington’s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n“If we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,” said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. “It fell in the sand,” he said. “If it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.”\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration’s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East — essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation’s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza.",

C.’s ChinatownThe Chinese Youth Club's lion dance troupe perform during the Lunar New Year parade in D.C.'s Chinatown in 2023. (Penny Lee)Harry Guey-Lee doesn’t go into D.C.’s Chinatown much these days. Although he grew up there, he mostly returns for occasional Washington Wizards games.But every winter, the same activity draws him back: the lion dance at the Lunar New Year parade.The performance, a vibrant spectacle meant to scare away evil spirits and bestow good luck, brings together Chinese Americans in the historic part of downtown where many of their parents and grandparents had lived and socialized. Year after year, families that have scattered to the suburbs reconnect with their heritage in a place that long ago ceased being a community focal point.“We care about the little bit of connection we still have to our past and our parents and the cultural traditions that are part of Chinese culture,” said Guey-Lee, who lives in Silver Spring, Md. “It’s a little bit, but we hold on to that little bit.”Guey-Lee, 73, is among roughly 50 members of the Chinese Youth Club who will step to a beat, play instruments and wave flags as part of a traditional lion dance at the parade Sunday. While several other lion dance troupes will also perform, the CYC’s team is the oldest in the District.The dance is a family tradition for some. Guey-Lee’s father played the drums during the early years of the parade in the 1940s before passing the torch to his sons, who carried kung fu weapons, served as the lion’s tail and played the cymbals.Now, the children of Guey-Lee and his brother also participate — and teach the next generation. People of all ages have a role: Toddlers carry flags, teens and young adults dance in the lion costumes, and older adults hold banners, play instruments and hand fortune cookies to spectators.The origins of the lion dance, which dates at least from the Tang Dynasty (A.D. 618-906), are disputed. One story tells of villagers scaring away a monster with an animal costume, firecrackers, and pots and pans. Another recounts an emperor who dreamed of an animal and ordered that it be re-created for festivals.The resulting dance, which has roots in martial arts and is traditionally taught to boys, is an athletic endeavor that takes significant energy. During the parade’s half-hour performance, dancers rotate in and out of the lion costumes to give each person a break — especially from carrying the wooden heads, which can weigh up to 10 pounds.“If you just jump in there and try to go 100 percent, you’re going to get tired really fast,” said Kevin Lee, Guey-Lee’s nephew and one of the co-directors of this year’s dance.Technique is important, and the performers under each lion’s head and tail are instructed to make their movements lively, Lee said. The instrumentalists and dancers work in tandem, with the music cuing specific steps and the person under the lion’s tail following the dancer under the head.The team rehearses eight to 10 times before the parade, with younger dancers practicing first at each session. When the older dancers get their turn, instructors teach more advanced moves and critique form. The performers do squatting exercises to prepare for some of their movements during the show.Ada Stuyvenberg, 12, said the hardest part of being a lion in the parade is, well, acting like a real lion.“You really have to do very quick movements, all while being smooth,” said Ada, who lives in Rockville, Md. “You can’t be like a robot.”Her mom, Daphne Pee, learned about the dance troupe from a neighbor last year and was thrilled to find the kind of Chinese American community that she didn’t get to experience while growing up in Montgomery County. Now she plays cymbals in the parade while her children dance.Pee, 46, said the activity helps her children stay connected to their Chinese culture.“For the parents,” she said, “we’re trying to keep that alive in them.”The old-timers ensure the troupe stays true to traditions, like “dotting the eyes” of each new lion head by dabbing red ink on various parts to bring it to life. When the team members leave a business after dancing there to bless it, they back out as a sign of respect, rather than turning away from the audience.But in other ways, much has changed since Chinese immigrants established the CYC in Chinatown in 1939. When Guey-Lee’s father immigrated from Taishan, a city in China’s Guangdong province, the organization was one of few groups offering structured socialization opportunities for the neighborhood’s young people.The CYC functioned like a Chinese YMCA, with volleyball tournaments and Chinese classes, among other activities. Each Lunar New Year, the organization’s lion dancers spent hours going store to store to bless Chinatown’s businesses while their owners lit firecrackers and gifted the performers cash in red envelopes.Jack Lee, Guey-Lee’s brother, joined this tradition as a preteen and remains involved in the dance troupe decades later. While he doesn’t feel as Chinese as he would like, he said performing is a way of “staying connected to Chinatown, as well as staying connected to my culture.”Unlike cities like New York and Toronto, D.C.’s Chinatown no longer feels particularly Chinese. Chinese architectural motifs still decorate shops and an archway celebrating the relationship between D.C. and its sister city of Beijing looms over H Street, but few Chinese immigrants live there.Many residents began to move out of the area in the 1960s in search of better housing and business opportunities and lower crime rates, according to a report from the University of Maryland. The area became the focus of government renewal projects in the 1970s and ’80s, and after the sports arena now known as Capital One Arena was built in 1996, shops and restaurants catering to spectators flooded the area. Many long-standing businesses were priced out.Lee and Guey-Lee felt those changes personally: The townhouse their parents lived in was razed for the arena’s construction. The neighborhood, Guey-Lee said, is “obviously a shell of what it once was 35, 40 years ago.”Most people in Chinatown participated in the lion dance back then, he said, and attracting new performers was easy. Now, it’s harder to spread the word. The D.C. area’s Chinese Americans have scattered to the suburbs and don’t have as many organic opportunities to meet. Children are busier than in previous generations, and those who live outside the city need parents to drive them to dance practices.Wally Lee, whose father was one of CYC’s founders, said many children a few generations removed from the immigrant experience feel more American than Chinese and may not know about the lion dance.“It’s only through word of mouth or being involved in our club where they see it in person and they hopefully will have an interest to try it,” said Wally Lee, 75, who is not related to Jack Lee and his family. “So it’s tougher than back in the old days.”The CYC tries to meet children where they are, recruiting players on the organization’s sports teams to the dance troupe and sharing the program at schools’ “international day” events. The lion dancers also perform at other events throughout the year.Kevin Lee, 37, said the performance can be an avenue for young people to engage with their heritage in ways that feel less like work than learning Cantonese or Mandarin.“There’s definitely Chinese school and things like that,” he said. “This is another way into the culture.”The dance is also open to people without Chinese heritage. Organizers said they welcome anyone who wants to experience their traditions and have had people of other backgrounds join the group.This year, one family of lion dancers is from Peru.A previous caption with the third photo misidentified the subject as Ada Stuyvenberg.

  "text": "RIGA, Latvia — A Russian military court on Tuesday sentenced Boris Kagarlitsky, a prominent sociologist, to five years in prison for criticizing the war in Ukraine — a shocking turnabout after another court originally ordered Kagarlitsky to pay a $6,500 fine but no prison time. The brutally toughened sentence was issued after an appeal from prosecutors, Russian state media reported, and it reflected a continuing harsh crackdown on the few dissident voices remaining in Russia after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKagarlitsky is the editor in chief of the Marxist online publication Rabkor and a university professor who has been designated as foreign agent, a label Russian authorities have attached to many of those who have criticized the war.\n\nThe previous court ruling, in mid-December, found Kagarlitsky guilty of “justifying terrorism” for an online post about a 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge, but levied only the fine as punishment. In many instances, defendants found guilty of criticizing the war now receive longer prison terms than those convicted of crimes such as rape or assault.\n\nIn the post that led to his arrest, Kagarlitsky said that the Crimean Bridge holds special symbolic meaning for “Putin’s era” and the “meaning” of Ukraine’s attack on it “from a military point of view is more or less clear” as it had disrupted Russian supplies to the southern part of the front line.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a post on Telegram, Kagarlitsky said that he was “in a great mood as always” after the new sentence was issued, and that he plans to continue collecting materials for new books, “including descriptions of prison life.”\n\n“Anyway, see you soon. I’m sure everything will be very good,” he wrote. “We just need to live a little longer and survive this dark period for our country.”\n\n“This verdict is a blatant abuse of vague anti-terrorism legislation, weaponized to suppress dissent and punish a government critic,” said Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s director for Russia. “By targeting Boris Kagarlitsky, a distinguished sociologist known for his critical stance against government policies, the Russian authorities are showing, once again, their relentless assault on all forms of dissent.”\n\nMoscow has cast a wide net against those who oppose the war in Ukraine. And on Tuesday, the Russian authorities sought to expand their reach, by adding Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas to a wanted list.\n\nThe spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, later explained that Kallas must answer for “crimes against the memory of the liberators of the world from Nazism and fascism,” adding: “This is just the beginning.”\n\n“Russia’s move is nothing surprising,” Kallas said in a post on X. “The Kremlin now hopes this move will help to silence me and others — but it won’t. The opposite. I will continue my strong support to Ukraine. I will continue to stand for increasing Europe’s defense.”\n\nKallas has been an unwavering supporter of Ukraine and has often called for more military assistance to Kyiv and tougher sanctions against Moscow. She has also advocated for the removal of monuments to Soviet World War II soldiers in Estonia. Russia considers the desecration or destruction of war memorials a crime under legislation that outlawed the “rehabilitation of Nazism.”\n\nLast fall, Kallas came under public pressure after Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported that her husband had remained a shareholder in a transportation company that was still operating in Russia after the invasion.\n\nKallas dismissed the reports as “a witch-hunt” by her political opponents, adding that her spouse is not a public figure and she cannot be held accountable for his business activities.\n\nHer husband, Arvo Hallik, said he sold his stake and resigned from the company. In November, Kallas was reelected to lead her party and has continued to push other European countries to sustain aid to Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have recently made confirmed advances south of Kreminna in the Luhansk region and around Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, according to the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\n\nBoth sides have been locked in a war of attrition for months, with Russian President Vladimir Putin betting on wearing out Ukraine and exhausting Western support two years into the war. In the West, there are mounting concerns about Ukraine running short of soldiers, and about depleted stocks of air defense ammunition.",

  "text": "Nearly two decades after Reed opened her store here, she is ready to retire and sell or lease her building to anyone who offers the right price. Her shop, one of the oldest in the neighborhood, served as a time capsule of a bygone era as Navy Yard transformed from a run-down, industrial eyesore to one of the most modern and expensive parts of the District.\n\nShops like Reed’s are a cultural touchpoint for Black women, who say their hair needs seem like an afterthought at most major chains. But women of different races, as well as men, patronize Ann’s. Local residents appreciate having a beauty supply store nearby, Von Reed said, rather than having to catch a bus to the next closest option across the Anacostia River.\n\nBefore Ann’s moved to its current location, Reed rented space in Southwest Washington’s former Waterside Mall for roughly 25 years. Her business was successful, she said, but the complex eventually became slated for redevelopment. In 2004, she bought her building in Navy Yard so that no one could force her out again.\n\nThe neighborhood started to change rapidly in 2005, when the federal government turned over most of the area to private developers. Industrial buildings and a low-income housing project were torn down, and Nationals Park and a new headquarters for the Transportation Department soon moved in — spurring an explosion of residential towers and waterfront eateries.\n\nThe resulting demographic changes were dramatic: In 2000, about 77 percent of Navy Yard residents were low income. By 2016, that population had plummeted to 21 percent, according to a study from the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity. The neighborhood’s total population surged from about 1,825 to roughly 4,664 in the same period.\n\nFour blocks from Ann’s, Albert Oh runs Cornercopia, a deli he opened in 2009 in the shop his parents once ran as a corner store. Most of the businesses from his parents’ era were gone about a year after the Nationals moved into their new stadium in 2008, Oh said.\n\nDevelopers have offered to buy Reed’s building several times over the years, but she said they never quoted enough money to make it worth it to her. If she were to pack up her store again, it would only be to retire.\n\nStill, it hasn’t been easy for her business to succeed in Navy Yard. Less foot traffic, fewer Black residents and the rise of online shopping have made it hard to consistently turn a profit. Reed said she can’t afford to hire employees, and her store is open five days a week — rather than six — now that more people work from home post-pandemic.\n\nTori Collins used to walk by Ann’s every day on her way to the office, often stopping in to buy a specific kind of shampoo or conditioner for Black women that chains were unlikely to carry. Sometimes, she said, she complimented Reed on refusing to sell to developers, seeing it as a sign of the power that small-business owners have to maintain their communities’ character.\n\n“We do have very few legacy businesses that are here,” Daniels said. “Some have moved into newer buildings, things like that, but overall, there’s not much left of the Navy Yard that you would see from 15 years ago or 20 years ago.”\n\nAbove Reed’s store, Ammiel Anderson has leased space for his barbershop since 2020. Anderson, who sometimes buys products for his business at Ann’s, expects he will be able to stay if Reed leases out her shop. But he knows a sale of the whole building might force his business to move.\n\nWhile some potential purchasers have expressed interest in the building, Reed said she has not yet accepted an offer. She doesn’t think another beauty supply store could make it in that space, now that the neighborhood has changed so much.\n\nA restaurant or a doctor’s office could probably do well, she said, but it doesn’t much matter to her who takes over the property. She’s open to working with any renter or buyer who will pay enough that she can trade working for gardening, spending time with her grandchildren and visiting family in South Korea.",

  "text": "“[I]t is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as ‘very smart,’” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung defended the former president’s comments as meant to criticize unspecified U. S. officials for giving Hezbollah the idea to attack from the north. He said Trump was referring to a briefing by a senior U.S. defense official on Monday that expressed concern about Hezbollah opening a second front. In fact, Hezbollah started bombardments a day earlier, according to the Associated Press.\n\n“President Trump was clearly pointing out how incompetent Biden and his administration were by telegraphing to the terrorists an area that is susceptible to an attack,” Cheung said. “Smart does not equal good.”\n\n“It’s completely lost on us why any American would ever praise an Iran-backed terrorist organization as ‘smart.’ Or have any objection to the United States warning terrorists not to attack Israel,” deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates said. “This is a time for all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel against ‘unadulterated evil.’”\n\n“It is reckless and irresponsible for Trump to have made negative comments about Israel — this is a time for unified support, not irrelevant comments that could give succor to Israel’s enemies,” Klein said. “I’m so ashamed of what he said. How does he expect support from people who care about Israel after making statements like this?”\n\nHis remarks also drew a rebuke Thursday from the Israeli government’s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi. “Shameful that a man like that, a former U. S. president, abets propaganda and disseminates things that wound the spirit of Israel’s fighters and its citizens,” Karhi told the country’s Channel 13. “We don’t have to bother with him and the nonsense he spouts.”\n\nIn a New Hampshire town hall hosted by Gannett on Thursday, former U. N. ambassador Nikki Haley called Trump’s comments “dangerous,” saying that this is what she refers to when she says her party needs to chart a new path forward.\n\nEven as Trump made his remark about Hezbollah, he acknowledged that it could be controversial, immediately adding, “The press doesn’t like when they say it.” He went on to repeat that he views Xi as a “very smart man” because “1.4 billion people, he controls it with an iron fist.”\n\nIn a speech Wednesday delivered to an auditorium of supporters in West Palm Beach, Fla., Trump elaborated that he had “a bad experience with Israel as president,” telling a story about the U. S. operation to assassinate Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. In Trump’s account, Israeli intelligence helped the United States locate Soleimani and plan the drone strike that killed him, but on the eve of the operation withdrew its participation.\n\nThe accuracy of Trump’s account could not immediately be confirmed. At the time of the assassination, the Israeli government reacted with restraint to avoid fanning tensions with Iran. In 2021, a retired Israeli military officer acknowledged that his country’s intelligence contributed to the U. S. airstrike.\n\n“I’ll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing,” Trump said in Wednesday’s speech. “So we were disappointed by that. Very disappointed. But we did the job ourself. It was absolute precision, magnificent, beautiful job. And then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That didn’t make me feel too good. But that’s all right.”\n\nAs Trump told the story, he suggested that he was recounting it publicly for the first time and that it possibly included classified information. He was indicted earlier this year by special counsel Jack Smith on 40 counts arising from allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.",

Palestinians cite a series of letters in 1915 to 1916 between Mecca’s emir and the British high commissioner in Egypt, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, as outlining a promise of an independent Arab state.\n\nIn 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly negotiated between Britain and France planned to carve up the Middle East into spheres of influence, and determined that the land in question was to be internationalized.\n\nIn 1917, Britain’s foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, expressed his government’s support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” in a letter to Baron Walter Rothschild, the head of the British wing of the influential European Jewish banking family.\n\nTo Israelis, the missive marks a formal utterance of the Israeli state’s right to exist; to Palestinians, it was an early sign of their dispossession. The declaration also noted that it was “clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” nodding to the overwhelming majority Arab population in the region at the time. (About 90 percent of the population was Muslim in 1850, and about 80 percent in 1914.)\n\nLarge-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Both sides continued to assert their right to establish a state.",

  "text": "Longtime observers of Hamas debate how much the Palestinian militant group truly evolved over the last decade, particularly during the period sometimes known as its “pragmatic era.” There is no argument, however, about when that era ended: Just after sunrise Saturday with the launch of a devastating attack on Israel. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.Since it seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, Hamas, while steadfast in its rejection of Israel’s right to exist as a state, nevertheless had made small overtures, analysts say, such as signaling support for a long-term cease-fire and opening diplomatic back channels. As the years ticked by, some Middle East analysts even began speaking of Hamas as “contained,” though they reserved skepticism for the militants they knew as among the most strategic and protean in the region.\n\nThen came the eventual — many would say inevitable — break from that position last weekend with a Hamas operation that stunned the world in its brazenness and brutality. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 100 were captured as hostages. The atrocities inflicted upon civilians, including children, analysts said, signals a dark new chapter for a group that likes to boast of striking Israeli military and police targets, distinguishing its conduct from the bloodlust of Islamic State extremists.\n\nThat’s the question researchers and policymakers who for years have monitored Hamas are trying to answer as they revisit the group’s trajectory to understand the motivations for an attack so extraordinary in its scope and lethality that Hamas surely realized it was risking its own annihilation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “cleanse” the area of Hamas in a war of vengeance whose toll on the militants “will reverberate with them for generations.”\n\nHamas’s official line is that the attack was in response to Israel’s long-running blockade and violence against Palestinians, but researchers said a host of other factors shaped the timing and methods. They also cautioned that the conflict remains fluid, with little verified information about the genesis of the operation and whether Hamas had help from Iran or other regional backers to execute it.\n\nAnother factor is the internal Israeli political crisis. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition government has continued apace with settlement construction while pushing controversial judicial overhauls that would hobble the courts’ role as a check on executive power. With thousands of Israelis protesting in the streets, analysts said Hamas may have seen the Israeli state in a vulnerable position and Palestinian voices once again sidelined in a political fight that could shape their future.\n\nAmid the chaos, a group of Islamist militants saw an opening. They issued leaflets offering themselves as an alternative to both oppression by Israel and corruption from mainstream Palestinian leaders. Founders of the group, a Muslim Brotherhood spinoff that came to be known as Hamas, “viewed the intifada as an opportune time to leverage all the preparation that had been taking place clandestinely for years” to create an Islamist resistance movement, Baconi wrote in his book.\n\nLike other Islamist groups, Hamas initially gained popularity among Palestinians by creating local charities and programs to tackle health care and education. That translated into political power in 2006 when the Hamas bloc known as “Change and Reform” won legislative elections, posing an existential threat to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority. As in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere, the White House had pushed for elections, then balked when voters picked militant Islamists over secular leaders who were seen as ineffectual and beholden to Western interests.\n\nLigon said Hamas stood out among regional militants because its leaders put a premium on enlisting recruits with military skill and technological expertise, “not just guys that were willing to fight and die for the cause.” She said Hamas fighters looked back at the history of World War I tunnellers as they dug their own underground warrens to circumvent the blockade. They also looked forward, she said, encouraging innovation.",

  "text": "Not long after arriving at Israel’s main airport Saturday night, CNN’s Nic Robertson and his fellow passengers hit the tarmac as alarms sounded.“We literally just got off the plane here at Ben Gurion Airport,” Robertson told viewers. “The sirens have gone off, people are taking cover.”Robertson, international diplomatic editor for CNN, is among the many television journalists who flew in to cover the deadly attacks, which represent one of the most serious escalations in a long-running conflict in the region. But it was “really remarkable” he had even made it into the country, as his colleague Dana Bash noted on-air, considering that many airlines had canceled flights into Israel.\n\nSince Saturday, networks have been “scrambling” — in the words of one veteran television journalist — to get correspondents and producers to Israel, to augment existing personnel or, in some cases, serve as lone representatives. Although most television networks still maintain a presence in Israel, staffing levels have broadly declined in the past two decades.\n\n“That’s our mission: to be able to be on the ground, to document what we see, to be able to report it,” CBS News President Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews said in an interview. “We take that responsibility seriously.”\n\n“When a story like this breaks, and it’s urgent, sometimes that means we have to make decisions in real time,” Ciprian-Matthews said. “That doesn’t mean we abandon one story; it just means sometimes we have to redirect. But it’s real-time decision-making.”\n\nOn Monday morning, MSNBC viewers saw Engel hugging a wall while reporting in the Israeli city of Sderot, which has been bombarded with incoming fire. “They’ve been coming in quite close,” he said on air. “That is why we’re on the ground right now.”\n\nCNN’s chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, took cover in a ditch about five minutes away from the Gaza border after a “massive barrage of rockets” hit. A minute into her live appearance, Ward was given the all-clear to stand up and finish her segment. But, she acknowledged to viewers, “it’s a little difficult after being crouched in a ditch to know exactly what’s been going on.”\n\nDuring a staff-wide editorial meeting Monday morning, Mark Thompson, on his first day as CNN’s chief executive, praised the network’s coverage: “CNN at its best, moving very quickly, with great — in some cases, really courageous, as well — front-line coverage and really smart people,” Thompson said, according to a copy of his comments reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nBut it has been a long time since the conflict in Israel has been the top story in the American media, which explains why some bureaus have thinned out and some — like the Boston Globe — have shuttered entirely.\n\n“Israel became kind of a marginal story,” said Stanford University lecturer Janine Zacharia, who served as The Post’s Jerusalem bureau chief from 2009 to 2011. “You still had someone on the ground generally, but there weren’t as many fully operational bureaus for the TV,” and the presence of print media had been “decimated.”\n\nIbrahim Hazboun spent 20 years as a producer for Fox News in Israel before being laid off in June. He said that staffing and coverage of the region have been on the decline for most of that time.\n\nAmerican journalists “were coming when there was an escalation of the violence, focusing on the moment without going deep and seeing the reasons why this was happening,” he said in an interview.\n\nAlthough Hazboun said the war between Hamas and Israel will certainly capture the attention of the world, he believes that gaps in coverage in recent years make it difficult for viewers to understand the roots of the current conflagration. “It’s a big event happening right now, but there were a lot of events that were happening before that were not covered that would give the perspective of why it happened.”\n\nCBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams has been reporting from the Israeli border town of Sderot, which is only a few miles from Gaza. Williams reported from Gaza in 2014 and 2021, but said it’s not possible right now to get there. “Even in normal times — and right now it is not a normal time — it is very difficult logistically to get into Gaza, because you need permission from the Israeli side,” she said. “I think a lot of journalists would like to be covering what’s happening in Gaza right now, but it comes with some very obvious dangers.”",

  "text": "“What should I do? Nowhere is safe,” Warda, a mother of three who declined to give her full name for security reasons, said in a phone interview from Gaza City. She was frantically packing a bag so she could flee south, she said, perhaps by foot, because she had no car.\n\nIsrael on Friday urged more than a million residents to evacuate northern Gaza, including Gaza City, where Israeli strikes have wiped out families and laid waste to its once-bustling commercial center. The warning prompted a chaotic exodus along treacherous routes to the south, where at least one convoy was bombed on Friday, according to video footage verified by The Washington Post.\n\nThe Israeli military said Sunday that it would “not carry out any operations” along a stretch of the main road that runs the length of the Gaza Strip. “Your safety and that of your families matters,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a message shared on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAn estimated 1 million residents are displaced inside Gaza, according to UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees. Residents said Sunday that they did not trust Israel’s assurances that it would refrain from military operations on the road out of Gaza City.\n\nThe ministry also issued an “urgent appeal” for countries to send medical delegations to help treat the wounded. It said medical workers in Gaza are among those who have been killed, injured and displaced.\n\nAt Gaza’s overwhelmed hospitals, doctors said they were moving patients to the floor to make room for the newly injured, while bodies piled up outside. At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the territory’s largest medical complex, about 30,000 people crowded into the buildings and surrounding parking lot, in the hopes it would keep them safe.\n\nAccording to several residents, some families were debating whether to stay all in one room, so that they would die together in the event of a strike, or to spread the children out in different homes and in convoys heading south. That way, they said, at least some members of the family might survive.\n\nIsrael has vowed to “destroy” Hamas and its senior leadership in Gaza, where it said it was preparing for a “wide range” of offensive plans, including a possible ground invasion. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 — and the enclave is one of two territories, including the occupied West Bank, that Palestinians envisioned as part of a future state.\n\nHumanitarian aid piled up in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, which borders Gaza, and residents flocked to the Rafah crossing in the south. But the border remained closed, despite reports that it would open to allow the evacuation of foreign nationals, including U. S. citizens.\n\nAhmed, who declined to give his full name for security reasons, fled his home near the border in southeastern Gaza, along with his wife and three children. First, they moved to the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood, but they had to flee again as the strikes intensified. Now they are staying at a UNRWA storage facility in Rafah city.\n\nIn Khan Younis on Friday, an Israeli strike hit the home where members of the Ola family had fled. It killed at least 10 members of the family, including Toqa Abu al-Ola, who was eight months pregnant. Ola’s 3-year-old son, Issam, was the only survivor, according to his uncle, Issam Abu Youssef.\n\n“I swear to you: Death is easier than what we are experiencing,” said Haneen Abu Youssef, the child’s aunt. “When you see a child like this, who lost his mother, father, uncle, grandmother and grandfather, the whole family, uncles and aunts. Nothing is left.”",

  "text": "That emphasis represented a shift for the Biden administration, which has given blanket support to Israel’s military operations in advance of a ground invasion that human rights groups say will result in large-scale civilian casualties. But there was little sign Sunday of any substantive steps toward easing the situation in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israeli soldiers were “ready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.”\n\nAs Secretary of State Antony Blinken touched down in Egypt on Sunday, relief supplies sat at an airport in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, less than an hour’s drive from the border with Gaza. Some of the aid supplies — delivered by regional countries such as Turkey, as well as the United Nations — have been stranded on Egypt’s side of the border for days.\n\nDiplomats and others familiar with the discussions said one of the main obstacles to the delivery of that aid is the Israeli government’s refusal to guarantee that it will not bomb relief trucks. One diplomatic official said negotiations were underway to allow Israel to inspect trucks entering Gaza.\n\n“We are calling on all parties to open the humanitarian corridor — to have a humanitarian pause in the conflict and to open the border, to allow supplies to go into children who need them right now,” Jeremy Hopkins, Egypt representative for UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nTouma said her agency had not been able to confirm that water, or some water, had been restored. Gaza receives water through a variety of sources, aside from the public water network, including from private vendors. Desalination plants and pumping stations require fuel, which Israel was still blocking.\n\nOther diplomats were less optimistic than the Biden administration that progress was being made on the humanitarian front. “Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies” even as aid stockpiled in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel itself could be “dispatched with hours,” U. N. Secretary General António Guterres said in a late afternoon statement. “We are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,” he said, and neither the hostages being held by Hamas nor humanitarian aid to Gaza “should become bargaining chips.”\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 2,600 people. Israel also warned more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, an order human rights groups have called impossible.\n\nBiden also said in the interview that Hamas needs to be eliminated entirely but that there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. But the president said he did not think Israel would pursue that path right now.\n\nIt said it shut access to an “area up to four kilometers from the northern border with Lebanon” on Sunday morning in response to an “incident” in northern Israel. It asked residents not to enter or approach the area and warned that GPS signals would be restricted.",

  "text": "Posts, videos and memes falsely claim that the attack stemmed from collusion between Hamas and Israel. In the 24 hours after the Hamas attack, the hashtag “TraitorsFromWithin” became the top trend on X, formerly Twitter, in Hebrew. Some threads posited that workers who were Palestinian citizens of Israel were stationed at the border fence, while others claimed the attack was orchestrated to push a peace deal with Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne viral TikTok video featured a woman who identified herself as a former soldier on the Gaza Strip. She claimed that the border was so tightly controlled that even “a cockroach” would have been detected in advance — a description many commenters took to mean that Israel would have had to have aided Hamas in penetrating it.\n\nHamas and its supporters have taken advantage of Israel’s disunity: On Monday a pro-Hamas account called Gaza Now shared an image suggesting that former left-wing Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was fleeing the country. The image was undated and showed him in the baggage claim at an airport. The Gaza Now account had picked it up from a Jewish Israeli influencer who supports the far-right government of Netanyahu, and had shared the content to criticize Israel’s left. The influencer ultimately issued an apology on X.\n\nA Palestinian digital rights organization called 7amleh says it has detected more than 19,000 cases of hate speech and violent incitement against Palestinians in the Hebrew language on X since Oct. 7, the first day of escalations. The organization’s executive director, Nadim Nashif, said he wasn’t able to flag the content to X because the organization’s former points of contact at the company had been fired by Elon Musk, who has dramatically shrunk the company’s workforce since he took ownership last year.\n\nBut over the past year, tech companies’ abilities to field these complaints has been compromised by waves of layoffs in units responsible for policing problematic content. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has laid off many members of a global operations team that monitors the platform, including Arabic speakers, according to a person familiar with the layoffs who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them. Under the leadership of Musk, X has fired the teams that acted as point people on the ground for advocates in the region. On Wednesday the European Union announced a probe into X for failures to moderate potentially illegal content and disinformation on its service.\n\nSchatz said there is little communication from Meta-owned WhatsApp because the messaging platform is viewed as a private, encrypted service. And at X, he echoed Nashif’s account that, over the last year, “there has been no one to talk to” due to the firings. He said the company had reached out for the first time this week.",

  "text": "With less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses, the 2024 presidential candidates were required to file their third-quarter fundraising reports by midnight Sunday. Former president Donald Trump reported a huge cash advantage over his Republican rivals at the end of September, a haul bolstered by his pleas to his donors to aid his effort as he is set to face multiple legal trials next year. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s fundraising slowed this quarter, as he retooled his campaign to focus more on Iowa. Sen. Tim Scott (S. C.), entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson all spent more than they raised this quarter, while DeSantis and former vice president Mike Pence spent nearly all the money their campaigns raised. Here are a few takeaways from the third-quarter disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission:\n\nTrump far outpaced his Republican rivals in fundraising in the three-month period from July through the end of September, raising more than $24.5 million for his campaign. He began October with $37.5 million in cash to spend, according to reports filed with the FEC on Sunday night. It was not clear from the available data how much of his cash could be used for the primary election.\n\nThe disclosures underscored the former president’s dominance in the Republican field and how his supporters view his baseless assertions that he is the victim of a corrupt justice system, driving legions to contribute to his campaign. During the three-month period through the end of September, he campaigned far less than many of his rivals, and his campaign spent just $9.5 million on his reelection effort — just under 40 percent of what he raised, one of the lowest ratios among Republican candidates.\n\nDeSantis had entered the field with considerable bravado earlier this year, as allies framed his fundraising prowess in Florida and the well-funded super PAC aligned with his bid as a juggernaut that could catapult him into a two-man race with Trump. But his campaign overspent in its early days, prompting layoffs and raising questions about its viability, all as DeSantis fell further behind Trump in the polls.\n\nDeSantis’s fundraising also has slowed considerably since his campaign launch, when top donors gathered in Miami to work the phones. He raised $20 million in the six weeks after his announcement. In the third quarter running from July 1 through Sept. 30, he brought in $15.1 million through a campaign committee and a joint fundraising committee, which is also raising money for a leadership PAC that was not required to file its disclosures Sunday night. (Money raised through the leadership PAC cannot be used to pay for campaign costs.)\n\nPrivate plane companies were a major expense for DeSantis in the third fundraising quarter, even as his campaign sought to cut costs. His campaign paid more than $1.5 million to at least six companies that provide private jets: Advanced Aviation Team, Avion Aviation, Empyreal Jet, Silver Air Private Jets, Israjets and N2024D. The private plane charges were mostly in July and August, with only an Israjets charge showing up in September.\n\nN2024D was paid more than $700,000 — more than any other entity in the DeSantis campaign’s expense report. It was also one of the campaign’s largest vendors in the second fundraising quarter and has allowed the DeSantis campaign and a supportive super PAC to essentially share the cost of private air travel, by providing lower-cost airplane leases — an unusual arrangement underscoring how much DeSantis has relied on the super PAC to cover expenses.\n\nPresident Biden’s campaign said it raised $71 million in the third quarter — a haul that his team expects to dwarf the sums raised by the Republican field. But as the incumbent president, he has the advantage of collecting large checks from donors in partnership with the national and state parties in sums as large as $929,000. His total includes money from his campaign, the Democratic National Committee and three joint fundraising committees, which can be used to support his reelection effort. Biden’s campaign manager noted that the team has been investing heavily in building its grass-roots program, beating their own expectations about small donors in the third quarter. But when adjusted for inflation, Biden’s total falls short of what Barack Obama and Donald Trump raised at the same point in their reelection campaigns. The president’s reports were not yet available Sunday night.\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who has been on an upward trajectory after strong performances in the first two debates, reported $11.5 million in cash on hand at the beginning of October. Her campaign said $9.1 million of that cash could be used for the primary election, which would put her in a slightly better position than DeSantis, But the amount of money available for the primary rather than the general election could not immediately be verified with available FEC data on Sunday night. Overall, Haley raised $8.2 million between July and the end of September and spent only $3.4 million — giving her one of the lowest burn rates of the GOP candidates. That has helped fuel her argument to donors that she is carefully husbanding her cash to use it with maximum effect as the primaries draw closer.\n\nReviled by many Trump loyalists because of his refusal to overturn the 2020 presidential election results — a constitutional power he did not unilaterally have — Pence has struggled to build momentum for his presidential bid, both in polling and in fundraising. His reports so far this year have been surprisingly anemic for a former vice president. In his report filed Sunday, he raised nearly $3.4 million in the third quarter but spent nearly as much, leaving his campaign with nearly $1.2 million in cash. He gave $150,000 of his own money to the campaign and has more than $620,000 in debt.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges he is facing is qualifying for the third debate on Nov. 8 in Miami. To make the stage, Pence must prove to the Republican National Committee that he has 70,000 unique donors. Asked about his progress toward that goal last week, he replied: “We’re working on it.” About 44 percent of Pence’s donors have given $200 or less to his bid, according to an analysis of his filing.\n\nTim Scott’s campaign and his allied committees have been among the biggest spenders in the 2024 race on television ads, even though he has gained very little traction in the polls. In the third quarter, he raised a modest $4.6 million but spent an eye-popping $12.4 million. At the beginning of October, he had about $13.3 million in cash left.\n\nFormer New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the most outspoken Trump critic in the field, is pinning his hopes to a surprise finish in New Hampshire that could build momentum for his effort in the South Carolina primary. This quarter he raised almost $3.8 million and spent less than $1.5 million, ending the quarter with about $3.9 million in cash. His advisers argue that keeping their operation small will allow his campaign to go the distance as he focuses on New Hampshire and South Carolina. About a quarter of Christie’s most recent haul came from small donors, and one of his top advisers said their “lean, responsible operation” will give them “runway” as the process moves closer to New Hampshire.\n\nTwo other candidates who could face major difficulties in qualifying for the third primary debate are Hutchinson and Burgum. Hutchinson said he failed to meet the polling criteria set by the RNC to qualify for the most recent debate in California. He raised about $666,781 in the third quarter and reported $325,287 in cash available at the end of the period.\n\nBurgum, another long-shot contender, has largely supported his campaign through loans. Of the $11.8 million that his campaign raised through the second quarter, about $10.2 million was loaned to the campaign by the North Dakota governor, a former software entrepreneur. In the third quarter, he loaned another $2 million to his campaign — raising a total of $3.4 million. Burgum’s campaign reported that it had $2.3 million in cash left at the end of September.",

  "text": "President Biden’s campaign announced raising $71 million in the third fundraising quarter of the year, giving him a significant advantage over the current Republican field while falling short of the inflation-adjusted hauls of Barack Obama and Donald Trump at the same point in their reelection efforts. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.Incumbent presidents hold significant advantages in the off year of their reelection bids, as typically they alone can raise money in large checks from wealthy donors in partnership with national and state parties. Sums as large as $929,000 are permitted in the case of Biden’s effort.\n\nBy comparison, the Trump campaign has said it raised $45.5 million during the same period this year, while the campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) raised $15 million. Biden’s $71 million haul includes money from his campaign, the Democratic National Committee and three joint fundraising committees, which can all be used to support Biden’s reelection effort.\n\nBiden campaign officials, who raised $72 million in the second quarter, briefed reporters on some parts of the fundraising results ahead of their official filings with the Federal Election Commission Sunday night. They declined to break out how much money went directly to the campaign or how much money the affiliated groups spent between July and September — information that will become public in filings Sunday night.\n\nA Biden adviser said that from April to June, the grass-roots fundraising program made up about one-third of the entire amount raised. Between July to September, 49 percent of revenue came from the grass-roots program. A Biden team member said that number outperformed expectations of about 36 percent to 37 percent coming from the smaller-dollar program in the third quarter.\n\n“We are especially proud of our efforts to exponentially grow our grassroots donor base, now having over a hundred thousand Americans signed up to donate on a recurring basis from now until Election Day,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “These numbers are a testament to one of our core objectives early in this campaign: raise the resources needed to run an aggressive campaign that will win in November 2024.”\n\nBiden’s campaign advisers said they had more than 493,000 donors making 843,000 donations during the quarter. The campaign said that they have over 240,000 donors this cycle who did not give any money to Biden in his 2020 race.\n\nOne promotional effort to sell “Dark Brandon” color-changing mugs, with an image of Biden that switches when filled with a hot beverage from wearing sunglasses to showing red laser eyes, raised $2 million since August, the campaign said. (The meme is a pro-Biden twist on the “Let’s Go Brandon” theme used by Republicans, which refers to an anti-Biden chant that was misheard by a reporter.) Separate fundraising contests to meet Biden or Obama raised $2.5 million.\n\nThe Biden haul roughly matches the $70.1 million that Obama raised during the same period in 2011, but falls short in inflation-adjusted terms. To have the same spending power as $70.1 million in 2011, Biden and his allies would need to raise $95 million in today’s dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe Biden campaign team said their cash on hand of the various committees at the end of the quarter, $91 million, was higher than the $76 million that the Obama campaign had in the bank at the same point in his reelection effort. In inflation-adjusted terms, Obama had slightly more spending power at the same point in his campaign.\n\nTrump raised $125 million in the third quarter of 2019, which holds a buying power of about $149.5 million in today’s dollars. But Biden campaign advisers suggested that they are not repeating the aggressive spending tactics that Trump employed at that point in his campaign to raise money.\n\nBiden has opted to build a smaller campaign operation in the first months of his reelection effort, while investing more than either Trump or Obama in paid advertising, with a $25 million advertising budget between August and December, most of which is being paid for directly by the campaign.\n\n“The gossip, chatter, angst, beltway cable talking heads are once again misunderstanding and underestimating Joe Biden,” said Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-chair of the Biden campaign. “You cannot deny the power of 840,000 people at this moment in time showing up in a real way and financially supporting and backing his reelection.”",

  "text": "BEIRUT — A Reuters videographer was killed and six other journalists were wounded Friday in southern Lebanon when the area they were reporting from was struck by Israeli shelling, according to two colleagues who spoke to the injured journalists in the hospital, as well as an eyewitness. Charbel Francis, a cameraman for Al Araby TV, said he was filming a barrage of Israeli shelling on a hill, while standing about 50 feet from the other journalists, when the strike landed. The battle was in the distance, and there was no indication that fire from Lebanon was coming from anywhere near the journalists.\n\n“We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed,” a Reuters statement read, adding that Abdallah was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon providing live coverage of skirmishes along the border. Two other Reuters journalists, Thaer al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh, “sustained injuries and are seeking medical care,” the news agency said.\n\nThe statement did not specify who was responsible. Reuters later reported, citing one of its journalists who was at the scene, that missiles “fired from the direction of Israel\" struck the group.\n\nA spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said Saturday that it was \"very sorry” for the journalist’s death but that it was not sure who was responsible and that Israel would investigate.\n\nAl Jazeera said the journalists had all gathered in one area for safety in Alma al-Chaab, a village in south Lebanon. In video posted earlier on Friday by AFP journalist Christina Assi, who was among the injured, several reporters could be seen wearing blue bullet-resistant vests marked with the word “Press.”\n\nThe Associated Press — which had a photographer on the scene — reported that an Israeli shell landed near the group during an exchange of fire with Hezbollah. The area had previously been a target of Israeli strikes, according to a Lebanese security source cited by AFP.\n\nReporters Without Borders said Abdallah was “killed by an Israeli strike while covering the situation on the southern border” in Lebanon. The press advocacy group described it as a “heinous crime against journalists” and said it was “continuing its investigations into the circumstances of this tragedy.”\n\nAl Jazeera said in a statement that its broadcast vehicle was “completely burned,” adding it holds Israel \"responsible for this brutal attack and calls on the international community to take action to ensure the safety of journalists.”\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a mission set up in 1978 to monitor the border between Lebanon and Israel, said in a statement posted on social media that a “heavy exchange of fire” erupted in the area beginning at 5:20 p.m. Live footage carried on several news channels showed what appeared to be sustained shelling into Lebanese territory that lasted for about an hour.\n\nA live stream from the area showed the hillside as the blast hit. A woman is heard screaming “I can’t feel my legs” before the feed is cut. Lebanese television broadcasts showed a woman in a press vest writhing on the ground, with fire billowing and a car burning in the background.\n\nAbdallah, 37, a video journalist based in Beirut, had covered conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and other major stories, including earthquakes that devastated southern Turkey this year. A wide circle of colleagues, friends and admirers posted tributes to Abdallah on social media Friday, and held a vigil for him in Beirut.\n\n“He was genuinely one of the most kind and heartwarming people one could know. Totally selfless, a bundle of laughs and an extremely kind individual,” said Tariq Keblaoui, who said that a few weeks ago, Abdallah had helped him escape a protest that was being attacked.\n\nColleagues also remembered him as a “brave friend” and some journalists recounted during a funeral procession held for him on Saturday that he often told them there was “no story worth your life.”",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nNorth Korea may be sending arms to Russia for Ukraine war, images suggestRussian commercial ships have been seen bringing cargo back and forth between North Korea and Russia since late August. (Planet Labs)TOKYO — Russian ships linked to military transport networks have collected cargo from North Korea and delivered it to an apparent Russian military port on multiple occasions over the past two months, according to new satellite images providing the clearest evidence yet that Pyongyang may be helping Moscow’s war effort. The two ships had no record of running this route between North Korea and Russia until August, when high-level meetings between North Korean and Russian officials began, paving the way for Kim Jong Un to meet Vladimir Putin last month.U.S. intelligence assessments at the time suggested that Russia was looking to get North Korean weaponry to replenish its dwindling supplies for the war in Ukraine. White House officials said Friday this now appears to be happening and named one Russian vessel, alleging that North Korea has transported as many as 1,000 containers with “equipment and munitions” from North Korea to Russia “in recent weeks.”But new satellite images, analyzed by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and provided first to The Washington Post, suggest this operation is more regular, extensive and ongoing than the White House revealed.Not one but two ships have been plying the route between the northeastern North Korean port of Rajin and a secure port facility in Dunai, in Russia’s Far East, making at least five round trips beginning mid-August through Saturday, according to the RUSI analysis.Although it is impossible to tell what is being transported, the new images show ships linked to the Russian military logistics network, which strongly suggests these commercial vessels are carrying military equipment, RUSI analysts and U.S. officials say.“This will have a very serious effect on the trajectory of the war [in Ukraine],” said Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at RUSI. “North Korea has the ability to manufacture a lot of ammunition, and it has significant stockpiles.”North Korea makes two of the types of munitions that Russia has used heavily in the war — Soviet-era 122mm Grad rockets and 122mm howitzer artillery rounds — and desperately needs more of as its wages its grinding war of attrition against Ukraine.Around the time the shipments began, munition pits were rapidly expanded at an ammunition depot near the Ukrainian border, which U.S. officials identified as the ultimate destination for the shipments.U.S. officials and experts have said North Korea has Soviet-designed munitions and other conventional weapons, including artillery platforms and rocket launchers, that the Russians are seeking.The new satellite images show that two Russian-flagged cargo ships, the Angara and the Maria, began traveling between Rajin and Dunai in mid-August.Analysis: Kim and Putin meeting shows just how much the leaders need each otherThey have made at least five trips since, moving hundreds of containers, according to the images. The latest delivery from North Korea to Russia took place on Saturday, when the Maria was spotted in Dunai offloading cargo, according to RUSI’s analysis.Shortly before they began operating along this route, the two vessels went dark, turning off the signal of their automatic identification system, according to data from ship-tracking site Marine Traffic. This allows the Maria and Angara to hide their position as they transit between ports.Around the same time, there was a rapid expansion of munition pits at an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk, about 180 miles from the Ukrainian border, images show.These pits have been filled with munition boxes in recent weeks as rail cars arrived, offloading containers that were lined next to the pits. The color and size of those containers matched the shipments arriving at Dunai from Rajin, according to RUSI.U.S. officials alleged last Friday that these munition boxes originated from North Korea, and the characteristics of the ships appear to support U.S. allegations that North Korea has delivered weapons to Russia for the war using this route.The White House last week released satellite images of what it said were 300 shipping containers delivered by the cargo vessel from Rajin to Dunai by sea, and then transported by rail to an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk. This transfer was made between Sept. 7 and Oct. 1, U.S. officials said.“This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global nonproliferation regime,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire in 1953, the two Koreas have been developing huge amounts of conventional weapons in case war breaks out again on the peninsula.North Korea is believed to have a large stockpile of artillery shells and rockets that would be compatible with Soviet and Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. It also has production capacity to manufacture new weapons that would help Russia maintain its high ammunition burn rate as the Kremlin seeks to scale up domestic production.This is widely thought to have been the catalyst for Kim’s trip to far-eastern Russia for a rare in-person summit with Putin last month, his first trip abroad since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Kim called his country’s relations with Russia his top priority and pledged full support for Putin and his government amid their war in Ukraine.Analysts say in return for supporting the Kremlin, North Korea may be interested in advanced technologies from Russia for its weapons and nuclear program. During his trip, Kim toured a Russian fighter jet factory that is under Western sanctions, as well as a key Russian spaceport.Neither the Russian Embassy in the United States nor the North Korean mission to the United Nations responded to a request for comment sent Sunday.Analysis by RUSI found that the operation may have started at the end of August and appears to have involved a second vessel, Maria, which followed a similar path as the Angara, the ship identified by U.S. officials.The images show the two vessels making multiple trips between Dunai and Rajin, picking up and delivering cargo at each location. At the Rajin port, the two ships typically load and unload containers at different docks. In Dunai, the ships have unloaded their cargo while next to a military vessel.Kirby said Russia may have responded in kind by shipping weapons of its own to North Korea. He did not specify the types of arms that the United States believed were shipped.Russia’s use of civilian ships to covertly carry out military activities has been well documented. Military analysts recently spotted signs that Russian merchant vessels are probably transporting suspected military equipment from Syria to Russia.The Angara is owned by M Leasing, which has been sanctioned by the United States, the United Kingdom and Ukraine for “transportation of weapons and military equipment in the interests of the Russian government.” It is managed by Marine Trans Shipping, another maritime shipping company sanctioned for transporting weapons for the Russian government.Registration documents for the Maria show a company called JSC Sovfracht is associated with the vessel, RUSI found. In 2019, the United States named Sovfracht as a company behind a sanctions evasion conspiracy to aid Russian forces operating in Syria in support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.",

  "text": "Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy protection, a move sure to shrink the drugstore chain’s bricks-and-mortar footprint as it grapples with falling sales, mounting debt and a slew of lawsuits alleging it helped fuel the opioid epidemic by knowingly filling illegal prescriptions. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.The Chapter 11 filing late Sunday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey not only provides $3.45 billion in new financing to support Rite Aid through reorganization, it also pauses opioid litigation brought on by cities, counties and states, as well as any individual claiming to have been harmed by the retailer’s conduct.\n\nCourt filings list about $8.6 billion in total debt as of June and total assets of $7.6 billion. It also posted a net loss of $306.7 million in its most recent quarter, nearly three times the $110.1 million recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nIn 2017, more than 1,000 opioid-related cases were consolidated in U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In March, the Justice Department filed a complaint alleging the drugstore chain and its employees ignored “obvious red flags,” and filled hundreds of thousands of prescriptions for controlled substances, including opioids, that were “medically unnecessary.” It also alleged Rite Aid intentionally deleted internal notes written by its pharmacists about suspicious prescribers.\n\nThe consolidated opioid cases will be handled under the supervision of the bankruptcy court moving forward, Rite Aid said. It was not immediately clear Monday whether the bankruptcy case would affect the upward of $30 million opioid settlement Rite Aid reached in 2022 with the West Virginia attorney general’s office. Other retailers with pharmacy operations have settled the lawsuits that were consolidated in federal court in Cleveland. Walgreens and CVS reached settlements of $10 billion with multiple states and Kroger agreed to pay $1.2 billion.\n\nRite Aid has closed dozens of stores in the past two years. It’s unclear how many of the remaining 2,100 locations or 45,000-member workforce will stay. Jeffrey S. Stein, who was appointed chief executive as part of the restructuring, said the bankruptcy process allows it to accelerate efforts to reduce its real estate footprint.\n\nThe company was founded in 1962 by Alex Grass as a single drugstore known as the Thrift D Discount Center in Scranton, Pa. After years of acquisitions and new store openings in five states, Grass changed the name to Rite Aid in 1968 and took the company public. The chain first hit $1 billion in sales in 1983 and enjoyed decades of prolific growth.\n\nBut in 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed accounting fraud charges against several former senior executives, including the founder’s son and the company’s former chief executive Martin Grass. In the late 1990s, executives overstated the company’s income, failed to report certain transactions and enriched themselves at the expense of shareholders. Grass was sentenced to eight years in federal prison.\n\nRite Aid also has struggled to keep up with Walgreens and CVS, which have benefited from pharmacy and health-insurer acquisitions and mergers. Meanwhile, retail giants like Amazon and Walmart have beefed up their pharmacy and medical treatment offerings, and offer more competitive pricing in store aisles on household essentials like toothpaste and body wash. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and the newspaper’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on Amazon’s board.)\n\nThe company saw some lift during the pandemic, benefiting from coronavirus vaccine rollouts. But inflation has also taken a toll. Consumers have pulled back on discretionary spending, leading front-of-store sales at Rite Aid to decline by 4.4 percent in the latest quarter.\n\nRite Aid joins a list of companies that have declared bankruptcy while facing a wave of lawsuits over allegations they helped fuel the opioid crisis. Cities and states have accused pharmacies of failing to flag or stop suspicious orders of addictive prescription painkillers — pills that were sold on the streets, resulting in an addiction crisis and record numbers of U. S. overdose deaths.\n\nLast week, a bankruptcy court approved a restructuring plan for drugmaker Mallinckrodt, a deal that cut $1 billion it owed as part of an earlier opioid settlement agreement with states. The Ireland-based company, entering its second bankruptcy in less than two years, had originally agreed to pay $1.7 billion. Another drugmaker, Endo International, agreed to pay nearly $600 million to states as part of opioid litigation but is facing government opposition to its bankruptcy sale.\n\nJoseph Rice, one of the lead attorneys representing states in the multidistrict litigation, said the bankruptcy process could help limit potential payouts of claims against Rite Aid, as attorneys begin the complicated task of hashing how much the company’s creditors will eventually get.\n\n“Certainly, this is an attempt to both avoid facing the realities of their conduct in the opioid case as well as dealing with their economic issues that have developed over the last 10-plus years,” he said.",

  "text": "The new fees come as thousands more electric cars take to the roads, thanks in part to incentives backed by President Biden and Democratic lawmakers. But some Republicans say that movement has had unintended consequences — including a decline in gas tax revenue, which they have aimed to reverse with EV fees and taxes that are sometimes double the amount paid by owners of gas-powered cars.\n\nCritics of the measures say they are part of a larger culture war on the right against electric vehicles, which conservatives see as a virtue symbol for wealthy elites and a dagger aimed at the oil industry. Former president Donald Trump warned autoworkers this summer that EVs would “decimate” their industry, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said in an opinion piece last month that he would “not let the government force you into buying an electric vehicle” if he were elected president.\n\nDemocrats and some experts say the fees and taxes could slow down sales and technological advances, and they dispute that the rise in EV ownership is to blame for depleted state transportation budgets. Gas tax revenue is also down because conventional vehicles have become more efficient and don’t require fueling up as often, and because the coronavirus pandemic triggered a sharp and sustained drop in work commutes.\n\nBut gas tax revenue has taken a significant drop over the past seven years. In 2016, it represented more than 41 percent of state transportation funds, but that fell to about 38 percent last year, and the downward trend is expected to continue, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Some states predict gas tax revenue could drop an additional 10 percent over the next few years.\n\nSome conservatives blame the booming market for EVs and hybrid plug-ins — which have grown since 2020 from 2 percent of vehicles in the United States to about 9 percent — particularly as the Biden administration has backed EV-friendly policies, including an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to lower tailpipe emissions that could result in two-thirds of the new-vehicle market shifting to EVs by 2032. The administration also has provided states billions of dollars to install electric charging stations along the nation’s highways.\n\n“Our vote count in the [House transportation] committee was very close as to whether the $200 or $300 fee was going to prevail,” said Tom “Smitty” Smith, director of the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance, an EV advocacy group. “In the end, we never endorsed the $200 fee, but it was clearly the better option. We saw that we could lose.”\n\nDuring a legislative hearing in March on a bill that proposed an EV charging tax in Georgia, state Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch (R) argued that the cost would be similar to what owners of gas-powered cars face when refueling. “Let’s say you go to Buc-ee’s or RaceTrac or whatever on your way to Savannah this weekend, and you pull in and charge at a public charging station — you would be charged the equivalence of a motor fuel tax,” Gooch said.\n\nCritics, though, say the new revenue isn’t likely to fix transportation funding shortfalls since most drivers charge their EVs at home. The taxes will also have an outsize impact on middle- and low-income EV drivers, who are more likely to rely on public and commercial charging stations since stations are still rare in apartment complexes and home installation of EV chargers can be expensive.\n\n“Every time one of these bills comes out that creates new financial burdens to EV ownership, it produces fear and causes people to wonder what the next financial burden might enact be to EV ownership,” said Eliza Cowie, policy director for 02 Utah, an environmental nonprofit that attempted to fight the new tax.\n\n“The veneer of equity with the traditional RUC program washes off upon closer examination,” Baumhefner said, adding that with the new California program, “all the fees get adjusted based upon the efficiency of the vehicles being driven, so you retain the incentive to reduce the use of gas.”",

  "text": "Blinken stood beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who offered his gratitude to Blinken and the American public for its “incredible support for Israel in our war against the barbarians of Hamas.”\n\nThe top U. S. diplomat is on a multicountry swing through the Middle East in an effort to manage the swirling crisis as Israel vows to annihilate Hamas in response to the group’s devastating assault on Israeli communities.\n\nGaza will not receive water or electricity until hostages are set free, Israel’s Energy Minister Israel Katz said Thursday. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, this past weekend is believed to have taken more than 100 hostages from Israel over the border. Their fate remains unclear.\n\nOn his visit, Blinken brought one of his top aides for hostage negotiations, Steven Gillen, who will remain in Israel to keep working to free the U. S. hostages, Blinken told reporters at a news conference.\n\nAt least 25 Americans have been killed following Hamas’s assault on Saturday, said Blinken, but U. S. officials have declined to say how many Americans have been taken hostage.\n\nDuring his visit, Blinken met Lior Gelbaum, 24, a dual U. S.-Israeli citizen who survived the dance rave in southern Israel that was attacked by Hamas militants. In an emotional exchange, Gelbaum told Blinken it was a “miracle” she survived, and urged the United States and Israel to focus on saving the hostages.\n\nBlinken said the Biden administration is also in conversations with the Israelis and Egyptians to provide safe passage to civilians in Gaza before a widely expected Israeli ground invasion of the enclave.\n\nThe densely populated Gaza Strip relies on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Severing gas and power from the territory could leave many residents without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care.\n\nEgypt urged Israel to refrain from targeting the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing — the only entry into Gaza not controlled by Israel — with airstrikes so it could be reopened for deliveries of food, water and emergency services.\n\n“You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to,” Blinken said. “We will always be there by your side.”\n\nBlinken assured Israelis that there was bipartisan support for Israel in the U. S. Congress, which is preparing to approve more military aid to Israel amid competing demands for aid to Taiwan, Ukraine and the U.S. southern border.\n\n“We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard, even when it’s difficult,” he said. “That’s why it’s so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.”\n\nNetanyahu said he showed Blinken graphic images of babies allegedly mutilated and burned by Hamas. U. S. officials said they were not in a position to authenticate the images, but Blinken described what he saw in the pictures as “depravity in the worst imaginable way.”\n\nU. S. officials are also working to provide safe passage to some of the estimated 500 to 600 Palestinian American residents of Gaza who are seeking to flee, said a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.\n\nBlinken did not confirm or deny a Washington Post report that the United States and Qatar have quietly agreed not to allow the release in the near term of Iranian oil revenue held in Doha. “We have strict oversight of the funds and we retain the right to freeze them,” Blinken said.\n\nFollowing his lighting round of meetings on Thursday, Blinken will fly to Jordan to meet King Abdullah II and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. He also plans to travel to Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia — continuing to urge countries with diplomatic relations with Hezbollah, Iran and the Palestinians in the West Bank to persuade them to stay out of the conflict.",

  "text": "Jordan — who narrowly lost to Scalise in a GOP vote earlier this week before the Louisiana Republican withdrew from the race a day later — emerged this time as the conference’s nominee with 124 votes, while Scott received 81 votes. Jordan’s vote tally was marginally higher than Scalise’s 113 count, suggesting he has much work ahead of him in getting to the 217 votes required to get elected by the full chamber.\n\nJordan’s elevation would cement the Republican Party’s shift to the far right — especially in the House — and would install as speaker someone who was a key ally in former president Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and a leading defender against Trump’s impeachment for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol.\n\nJordan’s nomination was less a celebratory breakthrough and more of an unsteady mile marker for a Republican conference that has been plunged into chaos this week amid deep divisions. GOP lawmakers’ inability to unite around a single candidate has left the House without a permanent speaker for more than a week after Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) was removed from the job — paralyzing the chamber even with another government funding deadline looming and a war breaking out in the Middle East.\n\nAfter Jordan was nominated Friday, Republicans immediately held another vote within the conference, also a secret ballot, on whether they would support him as the nominee on the floor. The aim was to see if Jordan would be able to win with at least 217 Republicans to avoid the debacle that befell Scalise. In that second vote, Jordan received 152 yes votes and 55 no votes, while one lawmaker voted present.\n\nMinutes after the House convened Friday morning, Republicans went into a closed-door session to consider proposed conference rule changes aimed at ensuring future nominees would have the support necessary to win the speakership in a floor vote. However, all the proposals were eventually withdrawn, according to three lawmakers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private session.\n\nMcCarthy — who supported Jordan for the speakership after he was ousted — said he was encouraging others to do the same, though he couched it with the fact that members needed to make their own decisions. In Friday’s conference meeting, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) again raised his proposal to vote to condemn last week’s motion to vacate McCarthy and renominate him for the speakership.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a staunch Scalise ally, said no pressure would change his mind to support Jordan on the floor next week. If Jordan couldn’t persuade people to follow him on something as basic as a speaker vote, Diaz-Balart argued, then it did not bode well for more complicated matters down the line like negotiating appropriations bills, the debt limit or national security issues.\n\n“This is, frankly, I hate to say this, the simplest thing we do, right? And if you can’t get your own people to follow you on a very simple thing like this, then I think you have an issue,” he said.\n\nSome vulnerable Republicans who represent districts President Biden won in 2020 were also nervous about what a Jordan speakership could mean for them electorally. Jordan is known nationally as one of Trump’s strongest allies, and Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) admitted Thursday night that recognition could hurt him in his district. But he also echoed a position some governing moderates have taken, which is that he would support Jordan because Republicans need a speaker to get back to legislative business.\n\nWhat isn’t helping Jordan in terms of garnering support is how his allies have behaved: They have threatened some of those vulnerable Republicans, telling them that if they didn’t vote for Jordan behind closed doors, they would get primary challenges in their elections, according to two people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private conversations.\n\nAnother House Republican said those lawmakers who vote against Jordan on the second ballot may soon feel the wrath of “the Trump effect” unleashed on them to get them to bend toward Jordan. A Trump aide said the former president and his team are unlikely to be involved in whipping the vote — though they are tracking the status of the speaker’s race.\n\nConcerns about Jordan’s past controversies also started to surface this week. The lawmaker has been accused by several Ohio State University wrestlers of knowing about sexual abuse allegations against the team’s doctor when he was a coach but doing nothing about it. An Ohio State independent investigation into the abuse did not make “conclusive determinations” about whether particular employees knew about the abuse by Richard Strauss, but a report issued later in 2019 said coaches did know.\n\nThe earliest the House could vote for speaker is Monday evening. Several Republicans were not in attendance at their conference Friday — because they were either physically no longer in Washington or because they were so angered by their own colleagues that they are now viewing these gathering as pointless — and it is unlikely the GOP will hold a vote with several absences. All week, Republicans publicly described their unproductive gatherings as “therapy sessions” or Festivus, a fictional holiday from the show “Seinfeld” that requires an airing of grievances.",

  "text": "Defense officials have ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza after militants broke through its border wall into southern Israel on Saturday and killed at least 1,200 people, many of them civilians — the deadliest day in Israeli history. In Israel and Gaza, people brace for a long and costly war“No power, no food, no gas,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. “We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.” Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, orchestrated the ambush over the weekend, when militants took more than 100 hostages to Gaza.\n\nIsrael has bombarded the densely populated enclave in retaliation, killing at least 1,100 people. On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that the border with Gaza was secured and that it was preparing for an offensive.\n\nThe Gaza Strip, a 140-square-mile stretch of land with more than 2 million people, depends on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Cutting off gas and power from the territory could leave many residents not only without power, but without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care. On Wednesday, Palestinian authorities said Gaza’s only power plant has run out of fuel and stopped operating.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General António Guterres condemned the siege Monday. “The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,” he said in a statement.\n\nIsrael provides Gaza with power in two ways. Gaza’s sole power plant is operated by diesel fuel, which enters Gaza from the Karem Shalom crossing. There are also 10 direct power lines from Israel to Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli siege could also “result in a severe shortage of already scarce drinkable water,” the United Nations said. The territory has several major desalination plants, which transform water from the Mediterranean Sea into drinkable water, but they need power to operate.\n\nSanitation facilities, too, could be crippled by the outages, increasing concerns about disease. Past fuel shortages in Gaza have caused sewage from the strip to contaminate agricultural land and spill into Israel.\n\nGaza “was on the edge of a humanitarian crisis for a very long time,” said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East regional director of Mercy Corps. “So this additional shock is going to turn this into a full-blown crisis very quickly.”\n\nIsrael withdrew its civilian population and military forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but has continued to control the flow of goods and people. When Hamas assumed political power of the territory in 2007, Israel imposed an air and sea blockade, which is also enforced by Egypt to the south.\n\nOver the course of the 16-year blockade, Israel has imposed shutdowns during key moments in the conflict, including Operation Cast Lead, which began in December 2008, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014. Those military campaigns killed more than 3,500 Palestinians in total.\n\n“Israel used its control over the access to goods and infrastructure needs as a way of creating a carrot-and-stick approach to the governing body in Gaza, Hamas,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “If things are calm, things are opened up. If things get tense, Israel shuts the spigot.”\n\nThe siege could also affect hospitals, which can run on generators but need fuel to power them. Several health-care facilities were already hit by Israeli strikes.\n\n“We are very concerned to see that medical facilities have not been spared,” Léo Cans, Doctors Without Borders’ head of mission in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement. “[An] airstrike destroyed an ambulance carrying the wounded, right in front of the hospital where we work.”\n\nIsrael has justified its overwhelming use of force by saying it must destroy Hamas’s military capabilities to prevent any future assaults on the country.",

  "text": "Often, states and localities have little money for buyouts of such places and little political will to pursue the controversial topic of retreating from threatened shorelines. Homeowners face unenviable options of letting their homes become inundated or spending large sums to try to move them, both of which have happened in Rodanthe.\n\nAs long as the houses teetered at the ocean’s edge, visitors couldn’t safely navigate the beach. Turtles and birds couldn’t use that stretch of shore as they normally would. The houses’ septic systems were at repeated risk of inundation. And if or when the homes fell, any collapse posed an environmental and public health threat that would stretch for miles as debris got swept away.\n\nThis scenic sliver of the Outer Banks has seen multiple houses crumble into the ocean over the past several years, and many more remain at risk of a similar fate. Some homeowners have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars paying to move properties farther from the pounding surf. And residents have implored local officials and the Park Service to do more to protect the fast-eroding shoreline.\n\nRob Young, a Western Carolina University professor and director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines, believes communities should consider more creative and thoughtful ways to retreat from eroding and flood-prone shorelines. Retreat, he often says, can be managed or unmanaged, and in many coastal communities it has largely been the latter so far.\n\nThe two homes the Park Service bought are not a panacea, of course, and it remains to be seen if such an approach can be scaled up. But even the symbolism of what the purchases represent — creating a public beach access from what is a public hazard — is a critical example of what is possible, Young said.\n\nKerlakian had to move the home’s septic tank to a more protected area, and was able to keep renting the home almost until the sale. But given the ongoing erosion, the reality that no beach nourishment was planned and the uncertainties of what lay ahead, he decided it wasn’t worth it to stay.\n\nNext door, Erick Saks received $100,000 less than his family paid in 2021 for 23292 E. Beacon Rd., when he and his wife bought the vacation home they christened “Mermaid’s Kiss.” A retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, Saks and his wife had gotten married in the Outer Banks, and he had cherished memories of past trips there. They had hoped to rent out the house but also have it as a place they and their two young children could forge their own Outer Banks memories.\n\n“We understood we were taking a risk,” Saks, who runs a Florida nonprofit he founded to help veterans who need housing assistance, said in an interview. Still, the home had stood since the mid-1980s, he reckoned, and when they bought it, there was far more beach than there would be only months later.\n\nSaks said he replaced the roof and spent tens of thousands of dollars to repair a washed out septic system, only to have it immediately wash out again. His family was able to stay in the house only a couple of times, and to rent it out on only a handful of occasions. He considered trying to buy a nearby lot and move the house, but concluded he had sunk too much money into a troubled investment.",

  "text": "The main roads running north to south were crowded for a second day Saturday after the Israeli military announced a six-hour window for civilians to move along designated streets to parts of Gaza south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands here. In some areas traffic came to a standstill with trucks, buses, overpacked cars and people on foot all crowding on to the same narrow roads to head south.\n\n“I am definitely afraid, very afraid, but I will not risk the lives of my wife and children on the way to the south,” he said, referring to reports that some of those fleeing were killed in an airstrike. “Let us die inside our homes,” he said. “The road is dangerous.”\n\nRawan Abu Hamda, 41, also from Gaza City, started out on an evacuation route but quickly returned home after hearing reports of a strike that hit civilians on the road. She said hundreds of other families have also stayed in her neighborhood, many sheltering near al-Shifa hospital, in hopes the building won’t be hit by airstrikes — although the ceiling of the nursery department collapsed on Oct. 9 after shelling nearby.\n\nReports emerged Friday of a strike on cars packed with fleeing civilians. The Washington Post verified a graphic video of the aftermath recorded along Salah Al-Deen Road. The video shows bodies, including several young children, strewn along the road as black smoke rises from vehicles engulfed in flames. On the north-facing side of the road, bodies are laid out amid personal belongings, including a bicycle, on flatbed trailers attached to a truck.\n\n“We had no choice, we have kids, they sent us papers that said ‘you must move or you will be responsible for what may happen,’” she said, speaking to The Post through a messaging app because cellphone signals in the area were too weak to make calls.\n\nThe evacuation orders appear to signal that Israel plans to significantly escalate its war against Hamas ahead of, or in tandem with, an expected ground invasion. But human rights groups and aid organizations are warning that civilians must continue to be protected, regardless of the orders to move out.\n\nThe hospital is providing care to a “large number” of patients, including children in incubators, and people in the intensive care unit, the Red Crescent said in a statement. The group said tens of thousands of civilians remain in the area and hundreds of people are also sheltering at or near the hospital.\n\nWith the conflict entering its second week, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said that 2 million people in Gaza are now at risk of running out of water. “It has become a matter of life and death,” the agency said in a statement Saturday.",

Here’s a breakdown of the charges against Trump and what they mean, and things that stand out from the Trump indictment. Read the full text of the 45-page indictment.\n\nThe trial: The March 4 trial date has been taken off the calendar and jury selection has been postponed indefinitely while Trump’s claim of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution remains on appeal.\n\nThe case: The special counsel’s office has been investigating whether Trump or those close to him violated the law by interfering with the lawful transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election or with Congress’s confirmation of the results on Jan. 6, 2021. It is one of several ongoing investigations involving Trump.\n\nCan Trump still run for president? While it has never been attempted by a candidate from a major party before, Trump is allowed to run for president while under indictment in four separate cases — or even if he is convicted of a crime. Here’s how Trump’s indictment could affect the 2024 election.",

  "text": "LONDON — Donald Trump’s legal battles crossed the Atlantic on Monday with the start of a hearing against a former MI6 officer’s intelligence consultancy, which Trump says caused him “personal and reputational damage and distress.”The 45th president is bringing a claim against Christopher Steele, a former British spy, and his consultancy, Orbis Business Intelligence, for alleged data protection breaches after the leak of an explosive dossier containing allegations that Russia had compromising material on Trump.\n\nSteele was the author of what’s known as the Steele dossier, which made extravagant allegations about contacts between Trump’s 2016 election campaign and Russian officials and said that Trump engaged in “perverted sexual acts” that were monitored by Russian security services. Many of the allegations were never proved.\n\nHugh Tomlinson, a lawyer for Trump, told a London court on Monday that Trump would deny the “scandalous” claims by “giving evidence in this court.” Tomlinson is a high-profile lawyer whose clients have included King Charles III and David and Victoria Beckham.\n\nIn his witness statement, seen by The Washington Post, Trump said that the allegations in the dossier were “wholly untrue.”\n\n“I can confirm that I did not, at any time, engage in perverted sexual behavior including the hiring of prostitutes … in the presidential suite of a hotel in Moscow,” he wrote. He also said he did not take part in “sex parties” in St. Petersburg, nor did he “pay bribes to Russian officials in order to further my business interests” or “arrange for or connive in the silencing of any witnesses by coercion or bribery.”\n\n“None of these things ever happened,” he wrote, adding that he wanted to “prove, by evidence at trial, that the data are false.”\n\nIn filings to London’s High Court, Trump’s lawyers said he was seeking unspecified compensation for the infliction of “personal and reputational damage and distress.”\n\nTrump was compelled to “explain to his family, friends, and colleagues that the embarrassing allegations about his private life were untrue,” they wrote. “This was extremely distressing for the Claimant.”\n\nLawyers for Orbis, a London-based firm founded by former British intelligence professionals, are seeking to have the case thrown out on the grounds that it doesn’t have a real prospect of succeeding and has been brought too late.\n\nIn written arguments, Orbis lawyer Antony White said that Trump had made “numerous abusive personal attacks and slurs” against Steele and that the former president had an “extensive track record of using legal proceedings to harass, bully and intimidate his perceived opponents.”\n\nSteele is a former British spy who at one point was in charge of the service’s Russia desk. He wrote the report for Fusion GPS, a private investigation firm that received funding from Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The dossier was leaked to BuzzFeed, which published it in early 2017. After Steele was revealed as the person who assembled the report, he briefly went into hiding.\n\nThis is not the first time that Steele and Orbis have been sued over the dossier in British courts.\n\nIn 2020, Britain’s High Court dismissed a libel claim by Russian businessman Aleksej Gubarev. A judge ruled that, while references in the report were defamatory and caused harm to Gubarev’s reputation, Steele could not be held responsible for the report becoming public.\n\nIn a separate case, Orbis was ordered to pay Russian oligarchs Petr Aven and Mikhail Fridman $22,000 each after they brought a case claiming the dossier contained inaccurate personal data relating to them that was noncompliant under data protection laws.",

  "text": "On Saturday, a week after Hamas militants launched a devastating attack on Israel, Czuba allegedly knocked on the Palestinian family’s door just after 11 a.m. When the mother, Hanaan Shahin, answered, Czuba assaulted her with a serrated military-style knife while yelling anti-Muslim statements, forcing her to run to the bathroom to call 911, according to local authorities and the family’s statements at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nWhen Shahin emerged from the bathroom after calling police, according to the accounts, she found Czuba attacking her 6-year-old son, Wadea Alfayoumi, who later died of his wounds. He had been stabbed 26 times, the Will County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Shahin, 32, was stabbed at least a dozen times and remains hospitalized in serious condition, the family said.\n\nWhen authorities arrived, Czuba was sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration to his forehead, according to the sheriff’s office. He was taken to a hospital for treatment but did not make any statements to detectives when later questioned, the sheriff’s office added.\n\nPresident Biden said in a statement that he was “sickened” to hear of the deadly attack in Illinois, which “stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.”\n\nBefore the service, speakers implored elected officials and members of the news media to employ greater caution, compassion and clarity in the days ahead because their roles are pivotal in fostering an environment that can give way to hate crimes. Speakers demanded an apology from President Biden for claiming to have seen photos of alleged Hamas-driven atrocities that his administration later clarified he had not seen.\n\n“There’s more than just a man that stabbed a 6-year-old boy here,” Imam Omar Suleiman said. “I want you to think about what was in his head. What type of hate has to be manufactured in the head of a man for him to stand over a 6-year-old boy and stab him 26 times?”\n\nThe brutality of the latest outbreak of warfare has unleashed language from all sides that is so hateful and dehumanizing that it has shocked even longtime observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. International peace activists repeatedly have warned that the ugly rhetoric could inspire violent retaliations in the United States, citing dark precedents such as the targeting of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the increase in antisemitic incidents after previous flare-ups involving Israel.\n\nIn the past few days, Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups have documented vandalism or bomb threats at synagogues and mosques, along with hateful messages and swastikas scrawled in their communities. Arab and Muslim rights groups say they have fielded calls from people reporting that they have been fired or silenced for expressing pro-Palestinian views.\n\nAuthorities gave few details about Czuba. As news of his arrest spread, people who live nearby said in community forums on Facebook that Czuba had long alarmed residents with yard signs telegraphing his “extreme” views. One woman wrote that she had alerted local officials about the “unhinged” man. The Post contacted the woman seeking details but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nWadea was born in the United States to Palestinian parents who moved here more than a decade ago and have since divorced. The extended family, which has roots in both the West Bank and Gaza, already was reeling this week from the perils faced by relatives who are fleeing the Israeli siege and retaliatory strikes that followed the Hamas-led attack. Hannon said they never imagined that the tentacles of war would stretch all the way to the Chicago suburbs.",

  "text": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet when the country’s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington’s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah “will be opened” so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n“If we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,” said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. “It fell in the sand,” he said. “If it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.”\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration’s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East — essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation’s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza.",

  "text": "Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nNorth Korea may be sending arms to Russia for Ukraine war, images suggestRussian commercial ships have been seen bringing cargo back and forth between North Korea and Russia since late August. (Planet Labs)TOKYO — Russian ships linked to military transport networks have collected cargo from North Korea and delivered it to an apparent Russian military port on multiple occasions over the past two months, according to new satellite images providing the clearest evidence yet that Pyongyang may be helping Moscow’s war effort. The two ships had no record of running this route between North Korea and Russia until August, when high-level meetings between North Korean and Russian officials began, paving the way for Kim Jong Un to meet Vladimir Putin last month.U.S. intelligence assessments at the time suggested that Russia was looking to get North Korean weaponry to replenish its dwindling supplies for the war in Ukraine. White House officials said Friday this now appears to be happening and named one Russian vessel, alleging that North Korea has transported as many as 1,000 containers with “equipment and munitions” from North Korea to Russia “in recent weeks.”But new satellite images, analyzed by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and provided first to The Washington Post, suggest this operation is more regular, extensive and ongoing than the White House revealed.Not one but two ships have been plying the route between the northeastern North Korean port of Rajin and a secure port facility in Dunai, in Russia’s Far East, making at least five round trips beginning mid-August through Saturday, according to the RUSI analysis.Although it is impossible to tell what is being transported, the new images show ships linked to the Russian military logistics network, which strongly suggests these commercial vessels are carrying military equipment, RUSI analysts and U.S. officials say.“This will have a very serious effect on the trajectory of the war [in Ukraine],” said Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at RUSI. “North Korea has the ability to manufacture a lot of ammunition, and it has significant stockpiles.”North Korea makes two of the types of munitions that Russia has used heavily in the war — Soviet-era 122mm Grad rockets and 122mm howitzer artillery rounds — and desperately needs more of as its wages its grinding war of attrition against Ukraine.Around the time the shipments began, munition pits were rapidly expanded at an ammunition depot near the Ukrainian border, which U.S. officials identified as the ultimate destination for the shipments.U.S. officials and experts have said North Korea has Soviet-designed munitions and other conventional weapons, including artillery platforms and rocket launchers, that the Russians are seeking.The new satellite images show that two Russian-flagged cargo ships, the Angara and the Maria, began traveling between Rajin and Dunai in mid-August.Analysis: Kim and Putin meeting shows just how much the leaders need each otherThey have made at least five trips since, moving hundreds of containers, according to the images. The latest delivery from North Korea to Russia took place on Saturday, when the Maria was spotted in Dunai offloading cargo, according to RUSI’s analysis.Shortly before they began operating along this route, the two vessels went dark, turning off the signal of their automatic identification system, according to data from ship-tracking site Marine Traffic. This allows the Maria and Angara to hide their position as they transit between ports.Around the same time, there was a rapid expansion of munition pits at an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk, about 180 miles from the Ukrainian border, images show.These pits have been filled with munition boxes in recent weeks as rail cars arrived, offloading containers that were lined next to the pits. The color and size of those containers matched the shipments arriving at Dunai from Rajin, according to RUSI.U.S. officials alleged last Friday that these munition boxes originated from North Korea, and the characteristics of the ships appear to support U.S. allegations that North Korea has delivered weapons to Russia for the war using this route.The White House last week released satellite images of what it said were 300 shipping containers delivered by the cargo vessel from Rajin to Dunai by sea, and then transported by rail to an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk. This transfer was made between Sept. 7 and Oct. 1, U.S. officials said.“This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global nonproliferation regime,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire in 1953, the two Koreas have been developing huge amounts of conventional weapons in case war breaks out again on the peninsula.North Korea is believed to have a large stockpile of artillery shells and rockets that would be compatible with Soviet and Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. It also has production capacity to manufacture new weapons that would help Russia maintain its high ammunition burn rate as the Kremlin seeks to scale up domestic production.This is widely thought to have been the catalyst for Kim’s trip to far-eastern Russia for a rare in-person summit with Putin last month, his first trip abroad since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Kim called his country’s relations with Russia his top priority and pledged full support for Putin and his government amid their war in Ukraine.Analysts say in return for supporting the Kremlin, North Korea may be interested in advanced technologies from Russia for its weapons and nuclear program. During his trip, Kim toured a Russian fighter jet factory that is under Western sanctions, as well as a key Russian spaceport.Neither the Russian Embassy in the United States nor the North Korean mission to the United Nations responded to a request for comment sent Sunday.Analysis by RUSI found that the operation may have started at the end of August and appears to have involved a second vessel, Maria, which followed a similar path as the Angara, the ship identified by U.S. officials.The images show the two vessels making multiple trips between Dunai and Rajin, picking up and delivering cargo at each location. At the Rajin port, the two ships typically load and unload containers at different docks. In Dunai, the ships have unloaded their cargo while next to a military vessel.Kirby said Russia may have responded in kind by shipping weapons of its own to North Korea. He did not specify the types of arms that the United States believed were shipped.Russia’s use of civilian ships to covertly carry out military activities has been well documented. Military analysts recently spotted signs that Russian merchant vessels are probably transporting suspected military equipment from Syria to Russia.The Angara is owned by M Leasing, which has been sanctioned by the United States, the United Kingdom and Ukraine for “transportation of weapons and military equipment in the interests of the Russian government.” It is managed by Marine Trans Shipping, another maritime shipping company sanctioned for transporting weapons for the Russian government.Registration documents for the Maria show a company called JSC Sovfracht is associated with the vessel, RUSI found. In 2019, the United States named Sovfracht as a company behind a sanctions evasion conspiracy to aid Russian forces operating in Syria in support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.",

  "text": "Welcome to The Daily 202! Tell your friends to sign up here. In Israel, more than 1,000 people have been killed since Saturday's attacks, according to the Associated Press. Palestinian authorities say that in Gaza, at least 830 people have been killed. Four things to watch in the Israel-Hamas warThe eyes of the world are once again on the Middle East after Hamas — which America and the European Union formally brand a terrorist group — carried out a sophisticated, large-scale surprise attack on Israel that has left hundreds dead and is drawing comparisons to 9/11 in terms of national trauma.\n\nIt’s too soon to say whether the bloody events of this weekend and the Israeli retaliation will dramatically reshape the region. But it certainly has the potential to be a once-in-a-generation crisis that fundamentally alters the dynamics of the decades-old conflict between the Palestinians and Israel and changes that close U. S. ally’s relationship with its neighbors.\n\nIsraeli warplanes have pounded Gaza, while Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the enclave would be cut off from vital services, vowing there would be “no electricity, no food, no fuel” for its estimated 2.3 million residents. (Some supplies may still get in through the Rafah crossing Gaza shares with Egypt.)\n\n“We are deeply concerned about Hezbollah making the wrong decision and choosing to open a second front to this conflict,” the official said. “Iran backed adversaries like Lebanese Hezbollah should not question the commitment of the U. S. government to support the defense of Israel.”\n\nPresident Biden has spoken several times to Netanyahu in recent days, and promised American help in the form of replenishing Israel’s “Iron Dome” anti-rocket defenses and intelligence cooperation. Biden has also sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean. Biden is scheduled make remarks on the crisis at 1 p.m. today.\n\nBut when it comes to aid that Congress must approve, things are less clear. The House of Representatives currently lacks an elected Speaker, raising questions about what the chamber can actually pass.\n\nEven as the United States has taken steps to extricate itself from the Middle East, Beijing has taken a more assertive diplomatic role in a region from which it gets the bulk of its oil.\n\nBut the invocation of 9/11 should give everyone pause. Twenty-two years after those attacks, key al-Qaeda plotters are dead or in prison, but Afghanistan is back in the hands of the Taliban. Iraq, invaded despite not having a role in the attacks, is a fragmented country under greater Iranian influence than before the war.\n\n“Israel’s military announced that the country’s border is under control after hours of fighting and airstrikes Tuesday. Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss of the 98th Division said that the military is now ‘moving into the offensive … to change the reality within Gaza to prevent such a thing from happening again,’” our colleagues report.\n\n“Momtaj Mansur is one of more than 50 current and former workers who said they were misled and exploited by firms that supply labor to Amazon in Saudi Arabia and by their network of recruiting agencies in Nepal,” NBC News, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and the Guardian report.\n\n“The White House is considering a move to attach Ukraine funding to a request for urgent aid to Israel, according to several people familiar with the deliberations, in the hopes that such a pairing would increase the chance that Congress would approve aid to Kyiv despite growing opposition from House Republicans,” Yasmeen Abutaleb, John Hudson, Jeff Stein and Leigh Ann Caldwell report.\n\n“On Saturday, the moon will pass in front of the sun, obscuring much of it but leaving behind a brilliant ring, or annulus, of unfiltered sunlight in parts of the western United States. This is known as an ‘annular’ or ‘ring of fire’ solar eclipse,” Matthew Cappucci reports.",

  "text": "That emphasis represented a shift for the Biden administration, which has given blanket support to Israel’s military operations in advance of a ground invasion that human rights groups say will result in large-scale civilian casualties. But there was little sign Sunday of any substantive steps toward easing the situation in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israeli soldiers were “ready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.”\n\nAs Secretary of State Antony Blinken touched down in Egypt on Sunday, relief supplies sat at an airport in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, less than an hour’s drive from the border with Gaza. Some of the aid supplies — delivered by regional countries such as Turkey, as well as the United Nations — have been stranded on Egypt’s side of the border for days.\n\nDiplomats and others familiar with the discussions said one of the main obstacles to the delivery of that aid is the Israeli government’s refusal to guarantee that it will not bomb relief trucks. One diplomatic official said negotiations were underway to allow Israel to inspect trucks entering Gaza.\n\n“We are calling on all parties to open the humanitarian corridor — to have a humanitarian pause in the conflict and to open the border, to allow supplies to go into children who need them right now,” Jeremy Hopkins, Egypt representative for UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nTouma said her agency had not been able to confirm that water, or some water, had been restored. Gaza receives water through a variety of sources, aside from the public water network, including from private vendors. Desalination plants and pumping stations require fuel, which Israel was still blocking.\n\nOther diplomats were less optimistic than the Biden administration that progress was being made on the humanitarian front. “Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies” even as aid stockpiled in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel itself could be “dispatched with hours,” U. N. Secretary General António Guterres said in a late afternoon statement. “We are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,” he said, and neither the hostages being held by Hamas nor humanitarian aid to Gaza “should become bargaining chips.”\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 2,600 people. Israel also warned more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, an order human rights groups have called impossible.\n\nBiden also said in the interview that Hamas needs to be eliminated entirely but that there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. But the president said he did not think Israel would pursue that path right now.\n\nIt said it shut access to an “area up to four kilometers from the northern border with Lebanon” on Sunday morning in response to an “incident” in northern Israel. It asked residents not to enter or approach the area and warned that GPS signals would be restricted.",

  "text": "President Biden’s campaign announced raising $71 million in the third fundraising quarter of the year, giving him a significant advantage over the current Republican field while falling short of the inflation-adjusted hauls of Barack Obama and Donald Trump at the same point in their reelection efforts. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.Incumbent presidents hold significant advantages in the off year of their reelection bids, as typically they alone can raise money in large checks from wealthy donors in partnership with national and state parties. Sums as large as $929,000 are permitted in the case of Biden’s effort.\n\nBy comparison, the Trump campaign has said it raised $45.5 million during the same period this year, while the campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) raised $15 million. Biden’s $71 million haul includes money from his campaign, the Democratic National Committee and three joint fundraising committees, which can all be used to support Biden’s reelection effort.\n\nBiden campaign officials, who raised $72 million in the second quarter, briefed reporters on some parts of the fundraising results ahead of their official filings with the Federal Election Commission Sunday night. They declined to break out how much money went directly to the campaign or how much money the affiliated groups spent between July and September — information that will become public in filings Sunday night.\n\nA Biden adviser said that from April to June, the grass-roots fundraising program made up about one-third of the entire amount raised. Between July to September, 49 percent of revenue came from the grass-roots program. A Biden team member said that number outperformed expectations of about 36 percent to 37 percent coming from the smaller-dollar program in the third quarter.\n\n“We are especially proud of our efforts to exponentially grow our grassroots donor base, now having over a hundred thousand Americans signed up to donate on a recurring basis from now until Election Day,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “These numbers are a testament to one of our core objectives early in this campaign: raise the resources needed to run an aggressive campaign that will win in November 2024.”\n\nBiden’s campaign advisers said they had more than 493,000 donors making 843,000 donations during the quarter. The campaign said that they have over 240,000 donors this cycle who did not give any money to Biden in his 2020 race.\n\nOne promotional effort to sell “Dark Brandon” color-changing mugs, with an image of Biden that switches when filled with a hot beverage from wearing sunglasses to showing red laser eyes, raised $2 million since August, the campaign said. (The meme is a pro-Biden twist on the “Let’s Go Brandon” theme used by Republicans, which refers to an anti-Biden chant that was misheard by a reporter.) Separate fundraising contests to meet Biden or Obama raised $2.5 million.\n\nThe Biden haul roughly matches the $70.1 million that Obama raised during the same period in 2011, but falls short in inflation-adjusted terms. To have the same spending power as $70.1 million in 2011, Biden and his allies would need to raise $95 million in today’s dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe Biden campaign team said their cash on hand of the various committees at the end of the quarter, $91 million, was higher than the $76 million that the Obama campaign had in the bank at the same point in his reelection effort. In inflation-adjusted terms, Obama had slightly more spending power at the same point in his campaign.\n\nTrump raised $125 million in the third quarter of 2019, which holds a buying power of about $149.5 million in today’s dollars. But Biden campaign advisers suggested that they are not repeating the aggressive spending tactics that Trump employed at that point in his campaign to raise money.\n\nBiden has opted to build a smaller campaign operation in the first months of his reelection effort, while investing more than either Trump or Obama in paid advertising, with a $25 million advertising budget between August and December, most of which is being paid for directly by the campaign.\n\n“The gossip, chatter, angst, beltway cable talking heads are once again misunderstanding and underestimating Joe Biden,” said Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-chair of the Biden campaign. “You cannot deny the power of 840,000 people at this moment in time showing up in a real way and financially supporting and backing his reelection.”",

  "text": "With less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses, the 2024 presidential candidates were required to file their third-quarter fundraising reports by midnight Sunday. Former president Donald Trump reported a huge cash advantage over his Republican rivals at the end of September, a haul bolstered by his pleas to his donors to aid his effort as he is set to face multiple legal trials next year. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s fundraising slowed this quarter, as he retooled his campaign to focus more on Iowa. Sen. Tim Scott (S. C.), entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson all spent more than they raised this quarter, while DeSantis and former vice president Mike Pence spent nearly all the money their campaigns raised. Here are a few takeaways from the third-quarter disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission:\n\nTrump far outpaced his Republican rivals in fundraising in the three-month period from July through the end of September, raising more than $24.5 million for his campaign. He began October with $37.5 million in cash to spend, according to reports filed with the FEC on Sunday night. It was not clear from the available data how much of his cash could be used for the primary election.\n\nThe disclosures underscored the former president’s dominance in the Republican field and how his supporters view his baseless assertions that he is the victim of a corrupt justice system, driving legions to contribute to his campaign. During the three-month period through the end of September, he campaigned far less than many of his rivals, and his campaign spent just $9.5 million on his reelection effort — just under 40 percent of what he raised, one of the lowest ratios among Republican candidates.\n\nDeSantis had entered the field with considerable bravado earlier this year, as allies framed his fundraising prowess in Florida and the well-funded super PAC aligned with his bid as a juggernaut that could catapult him into a two-man race with Trump. But his campaign overspent in its early days, prompting layoffs and raising questions about its viability, all as DeSantis fell further behind Trump in the polls.\n\nDeSantis’s fundraising also has slowed considerably since his campaign launch, when top donors gathered in Miami to work the phones. He raised $20 million in the six weeks after his announcement. In the third quarter running from July 1 through Sept. 30, he brought in $15.1 million through a campaign committee and a joint fundraising committee, which is also raising money for a leadership PAC that was not required to file its disclosures Sunday night. (Money raised through the leadership PAC cannot be used to pay for campaign costs.)\n\nPrivate plane companies were a major expense for DeSantis in the third fundraising quarter, even as his campaign sought to cut costs. His campaign paid more than $1.5 million to at least six companies that provide private jets: Advanced Aviation Team, Avion Aviation, Empyreal Jet, Silver Air Private Jets, Israjets and N2024D. The private plane charges were mostly in July and August, with only an Israjets charge showing up in September.\n\nN2024D was paid more than $700,000 — more than any other entity in the DeSantis campaign’s expense report. It was also one of the campaign’s largest vendors in the second fundraising quarter and has allowed the DeSantis campaign and a supportive super PAC to essentially share the cost of private air travel, by providing lower-cost airplane leases — an unusual arrangement underscoring how much DeSantis has relied on the super PAC to cover expenses.\n\nPresident Biden’s campaign said it raised $71 million in the third quarter — a haul that his team expects to dwarf the sums raised by the Republican field. But as the incumbent president, he has the advantage of collecting large checks from donors in partnership with the national and state parties in sums as large as $929,000. His total includes money from his campaign, the Democratic National Committee and three joint fundraising committees, which can be used to support his reelection effort. Biden’s campaign manager noted that the team has been investing heavily in building its grass-roots program, beating their own expectations about small donors in the third quarter. But when adjusted for inflation, Biden’s total falls short of what Barack Obama and Donald Trump raised at the same point in their reelection campaigns. The president’s reports were not yet available Sunday night.\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who has been on an upward trajectory after strong performances in the first two debates, reported $11.5 million in cash on hand at the beginning of October. Her campaign said $9.1 million of that cash could be used for the primary election, which would put her in a slightly better position than DeSantis, But the amount of money available for the primary rather than the general election could not immediately be verified with available FEC data on Sunday night. Overall, Haley raised $8.2 million between July and the end of September and spent only $3.4 million — giving her one of the lowest burn rates of the GOP candidates. That has helped fuel her argument to donors that she is carefully husbanding her cash to use it with maximum effect as the primaries draw closer.\n\nReviled by many Trump loyalists because of his refusal to overturn the 2020 presidential election results — a constitutional power he did not unilaterally have — Pence has struggled to build momentum for his presidential bid, both in polling and in fundraising. His reports so far this year have been surprisingly anemic for a former vice president. In his report filed Sunday, he raised nearly $3.4 million in the third quarter but spent nearly as much, leaving his campaign with nearly $1.2 million in cash. He gave $150,000 of his own money to the campaign and has more than $620,000 in debt.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges he is facing is qualifying for the third debate on Nov. 8 in Miami. To make the stage, Pence must prove to the Republican National Committee that he has 70,000 unique donors. Asked about his progress toward that goal last week, he replied: “We’re working on it.” About 44 percent of Pence’s donors have given $200 or less to his bid, according to an analysis of his filing.\n\nTim Scott’s campaign and his allied committees have been among the biggest spenders in the 2024 race on television ads, even though he has gained very little traction in the polls. In the third quarter, he raised a modest $4.6 million but spent an eye-popping $12.4 million. At the beginning of October, he had about $13.3 million in cash left.\n\nFormer New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the most outspoken Trump critic in the field, is pinning his hopes to a surprise finish in New Hampshire that could build momentum for his effort in the South Carolina primary. This quarter he raised almost $3.8 million and spent less than $1.5 million, ending the quarter with about $3.9 million in cash. His advisers argue that keeping their operation small will allow his campaign to go the distance as he focuses on New Hampshire and South Carolina. About a quarter of Christie’s most recent haul came from small donors, and one of his top advisers said their “lean, responsible operation” will give them “runway” as the process moves closer to New Hampshire.\n\nTwo other candidates who could face major difficulties in qualifying for the third primary debate are Hutchinson and Burgum. Hutchinson said he failed to meet the polling criteria set by the RNC to qualify for the most recent debate in California. He raised about $666,781 in the third quarter and reported $325,287 in cash available at the end of the period.\n\nBurgum, another long-shot contender, has largely supported his campaign through loans. Of the $11.8 million that his campaign raised through the second quarter, about $10.2 million was loaned to the campaign by the North Dakota governor, a former software entrepreneur. In the third quarter, he loaned another $2 million to his campaign — raising a total of $3.4 million. Burgum’s campaign reported that it had $2.3 million in cash left at the end of September.",

  "text": "No fuel has been allowed into the territory since the crisis began; many users, including the largest power plant, have run out or will soon. Nearly 1,800 people, roughly half of them women and children, have died in the bombing campaign, according to the territory’s health ministry. Another 7,300 have been wounded.\n\n“What hypocrisy!” he said in a translation of a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. “We will not provide an ounce of water and electricity to those who do not evacuate. We will work with all our might to eliminate the Hamas-Daesh murders and restore security.

S. officials said the situation was fluid. People who said they were linked to Hamas have set up checkpoints on the Gaza side leading to the crossing. In recent days, they’ve made several, often changing demands, including that no one can leave the enclave until trucks carrying aid on the Egyptian side are allowed to enter.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matters, said heavy equipment will be needed to repair damage from the Israeli airstrikes before trucks can pass. Their Egyptian counterparts, the officials said, have been cooperative, but are concerned that any opening would unleash a flood of Palestinian refugees seeking to escape. They’ve sought U. S. assurances that none of the people the United States has asked be allowed to leave — U.S. citizens, U.S. staff, including Palestinians, and Palestinians associated with American institutions — will stay in Egypt.",

  "text": "The new fees come as thousands more electric cars take to the roads, thanks in part to incentives backed by President Biden and Democratic lawmakers. But some Republicans say that movement has had unintended consequences — including a decline in gas tax revenue, which they have aimed to reverse with EV fees and taxes that are sometimes double the amount paid by owners of gas-powered cars.\n\nCritics of the measures say they are part of a larger culture war on the right against electric vehicles, which conservatives see as a virtue symbol for wealthy elites and a dagger aimed at the oil industry. Former president Donald Trump warned autoworkers this summer that EVs would “decimate” their industry, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said in an opinion piece last month that he would “not let the government force you into buying an electric vehicle” if he were elected president.\n\nDemocrats and some experts say the fees and taxes could slow down sales and technological advances, and they dispute that the rise in EV ownership is to blame for depleted state transportation budgets. Gas tax revenue is also down because conventional vehicles have become more efficient and don’t require fueling up as often, and because the coronavirus pandemic triggered a sharp and sustained drop in work commutes.\n\nBut gas tax revenue has taken a significant drop over the past seven years. In 2016, it represented more than 41 percent of state transportation funds, but that fell to about 38 percent last year, and the downward trend is expected to continue, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Some states predict gas tax revenue could drop an additional 10 percent over the next few years.\n\nSome conservatives blame the booming market for EVs and hybrid plug-ins — which have grown since 2020 from 2 percent of vehicles in the United States to about 9 percent — particularly as the Biden administration has backed EV-friendly policies, including an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to lower tailpipe emissions that could result in two-thirds of the new-vehicle market shifting to EVs by 2032. The administration also has provided states billions of dollars to install electric charging stations along the nation’s highways.\n\n“Our vote count in the [House transportation] committee was very close as to whether the $200 or $300 fee was going to prevail,” said Tom “Smitty” Smith, director of the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance, an EV advocacy group. “In the end, we never endorsed the $200 fee, but it was clearly the better option. We saw that we could lose.”\n\nDuring a legislative hearing in March on a bill that proposed an EV charging tax in Georgia, state Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch (R) argued that the cost would be similar to what owners of gas-powered cars face when refueling. “Let’s say you go to Buc-ee’s or RaceTrac or whatever on your way to Savannah this weekend, and you pull in and charge at a public charging station — you would be charged the equivalence of a motor fuel tax,” Gooch said.\n\nCritics, though, say the new revenue isn’t likely to fix transportation funding shortfalls since most drivers charge their EVs at home. The taxes will also have an outsize impact on middle- and low-income EV drivers, who are more likely to rely on public and commercial charging stations since stations are still rare in apartment complexes and home installation of EV chargers can be expensive.\n\n“There really has to be a holistic approach that makes sure that all consumers are being treated equitably and are being equally charged,” said Dylan Jaff, an energy policy analyst for Consumer Reports. “Many of these states haven’t increased their gas taxes for decades, and there isn’t the political will to do it. It’s easier to adopt these registration fees for a group of consumers that people typically associate with higher incomes.”",

  "text": "KYIV — Russia has agreed to free four Ukrainian children — ranging in age from 2 to 17 — and allow them to return them to their families in Ukraine after Qatar intervened as a mediator, according to a government official briefed on the matter. Two of the children are now back with relatives and two others are expected to be reunited with their families in the coming days, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations.\n\n“We welcome today’s positive news, about the reunification of children with their families in Ukraine through Qatari mediation efforts,” Lolwah Al-Khater, Qatar’s minister of state for international cooperation said in a statement. In recent weeks, Qatari officials have been in “continuous dialogue with our Ukrainian and Russian counterparts,” she said.\n\nThey also shine a diplomatic spotlight on Qatar. The small Persian Gulf country has often served as a key negotiator in global crises and could play an outsize role in negotiations regarding the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.\n\nSome senior Hamas leaders also live in Qatar, giving Doha incentive to show it is an effective diplomatic intermediary and not a safe haven for alleged terrorists. “Qatar’s role appears contradictory because it is one of the United States major non-NATO allies but it also retains ties to entities that the U. S. sanctions like Hamas, the Taliban and Iran,” said Elham Fakhro, a research associate at Chatham House, the London-based think tank.\n\n“Qatar aims to use its diplomacy to mediate between these different actors and grow its reputation as a global diplomatic broker, with some success,” Fakhro said. At this moment, “they’ll be trying to remind Western states and the U. S. of why their role is useful [and] needed.”\n\nIn March, judges of the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, and accused them of war crimes, saying the two bear individual responsibility for the “unlawful deportation” and “unlawful transfer” of Ukrainian children to Russia.\n\nThe full scope of the transfer of children to Russia is not clear. The official said a Ukrainian list contains the names of thousands of children while a Russian list merely has hundreds — a discrepancy that may make it difficult to find and return all of the children sought by Ukraine.\n\nForcibly moving children or stripping them of their identity is generally considered to be a war crime, but the ICC warrants are unlikely to result in any court appearances unless Putin or Lvova-Belova travel to a country willing to arrest them.\n\nThe four Ukrainian children returning home this week are the first to be released as part of Qatar’s negotiations because “all parties agreed they found their parents, documents all matched [and] they could be reunited,” the official said.\n\nThe 2-year-old, who will return to the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine, was in the hospital — and just 6 months old — when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and “lost contact with his mother,” according to the official.\n\nThe two have since been reunited in Russia and are expected to travel to Ukraine this week. Details of how or when the then-infant was transferred to Russian custody are unclear. Russian forces occupied some parts of Zhytomyr region in the first weeks of the war before being forced to retreat.\n\nA 7-year-old boy, who has been staying in a children’s home in Russia, was recently reunited with his grandmother, who traveled to Russia through Estonia, the official said. The pair is now on their way back to Ukraine. The boy’s mother, who was arrested in Russia, remains in custody there. It was not clear when or why she was detained.\n\nSome other Ukrainian children held in Russia have also been released to their parents on a case-by-case basis, usually after a relative traveled to Russia and personally escorted them home, a task that can be difficult, dangerous and financially impossible for many Ukrainian families.",
