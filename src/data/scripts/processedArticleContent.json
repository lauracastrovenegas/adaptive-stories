    "description": "Judith and Natalie Raanan of Illinois were visiting Israel for a family birthday and the High Holy Days when they were taken captive by the militant group Oct. 7.",
    "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Hamas released two American hostages on Friday, U. S. and Israeli officials said, the first of the at least 200 captives the militant group has held since it rampaged through Israeli towns two weeks ago.The mother and daughter, released to the Red Cross in Gaza, were transferred to an Israeli military team and escorted to an army base in Israel to be reunited with their family members, officials said.\n\nThe pair, identified as Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie Raanan, of Evanston, Ill., were in Israel to visit family when they were kidnapped from Nahal Oz, a kibbutz not far from the border fence breached by Hamas fighters. The group said it released them at the request of Qatari mediators for \u201chumanitarian reasons.\u201d\n\nUntil Friday, Hamas had ignored demands from Israel and pleas from Western governments to free the captives, many of whom are children, ill or elderly. Israel has said it would not allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza through its territory until the hostages were freed. Human rights groups have said taking civilian hostages is an unambiguous war crime. President Biden has called Hamas\u2019s actions \u201cpure evil.\u201d\n\nBiden, who asked Congress on Friday to authorize a sweeping aid package for Israel, said U. S. officials and their allies were \u201cworking around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas.\u201d He pledged to continue pushing for the release of all still being held.\n\n\u201cOur fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nInside the Palestinian enclave, a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding: Nearly 2 million people have been cut off from food, water, fuel and medicine as they weather a relentless Israeli bombing campaign. Hospitals faced with dire shortages were on \u201cthe brink of collapse,\u201d the United Nations reported.\n\nBiden, who said this week that Israel and Egypt had assured him they would allow the aid trucks to pass, announced Friday that the crossing would open \u201cin the next 24 to 48 hours.\u201d\n\nElsewhere along the border, the Israeli military was massing troops and armored vehicles in preparation for the anticipated ground invasion of the densely populated territory. The operation would involve heavy urban combat and almost certainly would lead to an escalation in civilian casualties, analysts said.\n\nAs Israel prepared for a ground war, and besieged bystanders braced for its likely consequences, Amnesty International said it had found \u201cdamning evidence\u201d of Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Amnesty investigators said Israeli attacks have destroyed block after block of residential buildings and critical infrastructure and caused \u201cmass civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nFrom Egypt to Indonesia and in several American cities, demonstrators again took to the streets, shouting down Israel and its allies, especially the United States, and demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed 4,137 people in Gaza and wounded more than 13,200, Palestinian officials say. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli officials say. Hamas, rampaging through villages and kibbutz settlements, took more than 200 people hostage.\n\nTen Americans remained unaccounted for, Blinken said, and authorities knew that Hamas was holding at least some of them hostage. Diplomats were working feverishly to secure their release, Blinken said. He declined to share further details.\n\nThe Raanans\u2019 release spurred more urgent calls for the remaining hostages to be set free. The Hostages and Missing Families forum, a group in Israel, sought to pressure Arab leaders in the region to work to return their loved ones safely.\n\nA spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli authorities \u201cwill continue to operate with the best of their abilities and efforts in order to locate all of the missing and return all of the abductees home.\u201d"

    "description": "The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, says it is no longer able to provide aid in Gaza as supplies dwindle and strikes continue.",
    "content": "Amid a spiraling crisis in Gaza, where deadly Israeli strikes have forced more than 1 million residents from their homes, one key U. N. agency in the enclave has been working \u2014 and now struggling \u2014 to protect and support civilians.The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, warned that it is no longer able to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza. \u201cWe are on the verge of collapse,\u201d UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Sunday.\n\n\u201cGaza is being strangled and it seems that the world right now has lost its humanity,\u201d the agency\u2019s commissioner general said. The Israeli siege of the enclave has sapped its essential resources, Lazzarini said, adding that \u201cnot one drop of water, not one grain of wheat, not a liter of fuel\u201d has been allowed into the Gaza Strip for more than a week. Without those supplies, the agency cannot continue its operations, he said.\n\nAlmost 2,700 people have been killed in Gaza, and about 9,600 have been injured in Israeli strikes, following the deadly Oct. 7 rampage by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. In Gaza, nearly a million have been displaced \u2014 with 400,000 sheltering in overwhelmed and ill-equipped UNRWA school buildings, the agency said.\n\nThe agency has specific eligibility guidelines for who can register: A person whose \u201cnormal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\u201d\n\nThe descendants of male Palestinian refugees are also eligible, according to the agency\u2019s website, which says about 5.9 million Palestinians are eligible for its services. UNRWA aid and services are available in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon. There are about 2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 3 million in the West Bank, according to a 2022 U. S. estimate.\n\nMost of the funding for UNRWA comes from \u201cvoluntary contributions\u201d from U. N. member states, with a small portion of its financing coming from the U.N.\u2019s regular budget. Its mandate has been repeatedly renewed \u201cin the absence of a solution to the Palestine refugee problem,\u201d it says. The U.N. renewed the mandate in December until June 2026.\n\nThe schools aim to ensure students become \u201cconfident, innovative, questioning, thoughtful, and open-minded, to uphold human values and tolerance, proud of their Palestinian identity and contributing positively to the development of society and the global community,\u201d the agency says.\n\nSince the conflict broke out, at least 400,000 displaced people in Gaza are now sheltering in UNRWA schools and buildings, Lazzarini said in a statement Sunday, adding that the buildings are not equipped as emergency shelters. \u201cWe have reports in our logistics base, for example, where hundreds of people are just sharing one toilet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe way the siege in Gaza is being imposed by Israel is \u201cnothing else than collective punishment,\u201d he said, criticizing the bombing of civilian infrastructure in densely populated areas and the lack of access to essential resources such as fuel, food, electricity and water in Gaza.\n\nThe agency said in a Saturday statement that its shelters in Gaza were \u201cno longer safe.\u201d It called on Israel to \u201cprotect all civilians sheltering in UNRWA premises across the Gaza Strip,\u201d including in northern Gaza, where Israel\u2019s military has told more than a million Palestinians to evacuate south \u2014 though doing so has proved difficult and dangerous for many.\n\nUNRWA said that many Gazans \u201cwill not be able to flee the area,\u201d particularly women, children, and the elderly and disabled. \u201cThey have no choice and must be protected at all times,\u201d it added.\n\nLazzarini said that the agency has lost 14 staff members in the conflict, including teachers, engineers, guards, psychologists, an engineer and a gynecologist. More than 13,000 staff members were displaced, and the team relocated to Rafah, in southern Gaza, after the evacuation directive."

    "description": "The Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza\u2019s oldest active church, was sheltering hundreds of Muslims and Christians displaced by the war, according to religious officials.",
    "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 The historic Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza\u2019s oldest active church, was struck Thursday by Israel as it sheltered hundreds of Palestinians displaced by the war, according to religious officials. Maher Ayyad, 72, a member of the community, said the strike hit a two-story building in the church compound, killing 18 people and injuring at least 20. About 100 people were in the bombed building at the time of the strike, he said, and about 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.\n\nAmash tweeted Friday afternoon that several relatives who had been sheltering in the church, including two women he identified as Viola and Yara, were killed in the strike.\n\nThere are about 1,000 Palestinian Christians remaining in Gaza, and the loss was \u201chuge\u201d for the community, Ayyad said. About 500 Christians, including Ayyad, have relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.\n\nThe Washington Post geolocated the strike and confirmed the location of the church based on a video that shows people searching through rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem blamed Israel for the strike.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in an emailed statement that a strike targeting a Hamas control center \u201cdamaged the wall of a church in the area\u201d and that it was \u201caware of reports on casualties\u201d and was reviewing the incident. They declined to provide further information and reiterated, \u201cIt is important to clarify that the Church was not the target of the strike.\u201d\n\nAyyad is also a medical director at al-Ahli Hospital, where a blast Tuesday killed 471 people and injured more than 300, according to Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Israel has disputed that death toll.\n\nThe Order of St. George, an associated order of the church, issued a statement confirming Thursday\u2019s strike. \u201cArchbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don\u2019t know if he is injured,\u201d the Order of St. George stated. The blast hit \u201ctwo church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping.\u201d\n\nThe Church of St. Porphyrius\u2019s original structure dated to the 5th century, and the current structure, in a historic quarter of the city, was built in the 12th century. It is named for a former bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, and placed where he is believed to have died in A. D. 420. The church, characterized by thick walls and a richly decorated interior, has long been a place of refuge and community for its members, who are a religious minority in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA Palestinian American woman who moved from Gaza to the United States in the early 2000s said in an interview that she had relatives and friends sheltering in the church at the time of the strike, some of whom were injured.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re terrified. They\u2019re shaken. They don\u2019t know what to do, and they don\u2019t know where else to go,\u201d said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her family\u2019s safety. She expressed outrage at the idea that more than 1 million civilians could evacuate from a place as densely populated and heavily bombed as Gaza City \u2014 a mass movement called for by Israel last week. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that she grew up going to the Church of St. Porphyrius and that her family has deep ties to the church, dating to when they became refugees during the 1948 founding of Israel and mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nDescribing the congregation as close-knit and family-like, she said she\u2019s not only worried about her relatives. \u201cI\u2019m concerned for everyone because we\u2019re a small community.\u201d\n\nChristians make up about 1 percent of Gaza\u2019s population and have faced restrictions and discrimination by the Hamas government, according to human rights groups. During the 2014 Gaza war, about 1,000 Palestinian Muslims fled Israeli shelling for the Church of St. Porphyrius, where graves were damaged by shrapnel from a nearby strike, Reuters reported."

Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.\n\nOkal and his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son Yousef left their home outside Boston last month for a long-planned reunion with their parents. They were supposed to fly home on Friday. Now they don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll be able to get back to the United States.\n\nOkal\u2019s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday\u2019s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.\n\nAs Okal spoke over the phone from the home of his wife\u2019s parents in the wee hours of Friday, there were at least eight audible explosions, with others in the distance.\n\nSleep is elusive. The bombs shake them awake, Okal said, and they find themselves coughing in air heavy with dust from pulverized buildings. He and his wife get up early, taking turns caring for their toddler and trying their best to pretend, for his sake, that everything will be all right.\n\nThe electricity is gone. The family is relying on a few solar panels, some batteries and power banks to recharge their phones and turn on a television for news. Their supply of milk and diapers is dwindling.\n\nThe market across the street has no bottled water left. Soon they will have to choose whether to risk going farther away in search of it, exposing themselves to more potential danger, or start drinking the water from a tank usually only used for washing or bathing.\n\nOkal works at pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb and lives in Medway, a small town southwest of Boston. He went to college in New Jersey and did graduate studies in Utah, where he developed a taste for snowboarding.\n\nOnce, when he was hiking in Zion National Park, he and a group of friends were trapped by a flash flood.

He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen things on this scale,\u201d Okal said.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have tried to get on a list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but they\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s functioning or if they would be turned back. When Okal\u2019s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far \u2014 even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.\n\nIf his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws."

    "description": "Americans have been unable to cross into Egypt from Gaza after the Rafah crossing remained closed Saturday despite a U.S. deal to open it for several hours.",
    "content": "Before dawn on Saturday, Abood Okal and his family received the news they had desperately been waiting for. Okal and his wife and their 1-year-old son were finally offered a possible way out of Gaza \u2014 and back to their home near Boston. An email from the U.S. State Department told them the sole border crossing with Egypt \u201cmay be open\u201d for a five-hour window later that day, from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Okal and his family went to the Rafah crossing only to find it closed. There were no officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing except for a few plainclothes security guards whose job was to keep people from getting too close to the gate, Okal said.\n\nThe U. S. government had negotiated a deal to allow American citizens to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt during the five-hour window, U.S. officials said Saturday. But Palestinian and Egyptian officials failed to communicate about opening it, an official at the border said. By the end of the day, no one had been able to cross.\n\nWael Abu Omar, the Palestinian spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said Palestinian officials had not had any communication with their counterparts on the Egyptian side. Egyptian media outlets reported that Cairo would only allow foreigners to cross the border if aid shipments could be delivered to Gaza.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has said it would strike any trucks coming across the border, especially trucks carrying fuel, according to a diplomatic official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nOfficials are discussing the possibility of setting up a screening mechanism that would allow the Israelis to inspect goods in each vehicle entering Gaza, the diplomat said. Another official familiar with the talks over the aid deliveries said any agreement would require \u201cIsrael to stop bombing the enclave for a few hours.\u201d\n\nThe confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Rafah crossing comes as hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in response to an evacuation order from Israel\u2019s military, ahead of a possible ground invasion into the besieged enclave.\n\n\u201cWe have informed U. S. citizens in Gaza with whom we are in contact that if they assess it to be safe, they may wish to move closer to the Rafah border crossing,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that \u201cthere may be very little notice if the crossing opens and it may only open for a limited time.\u201d\n\nU. S. officials have spent the past several days trying to evacuate all U.S. staff in Gaza, a group of about 15 Palestinians that includes three U.S. government employees who work for USAID in Gaza, along with their immediate family members, according to a diplomatic official familiar with the situation.\n\nEach time, they\u2019ve been stopped at checkpoints near the border inside Gaza and have been unable to leave. In some cases at these checkpoints, the diplomatic official said, people identifying themselves as Hamas have said none of them will be able to leave until aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip.\n\nCanadian officials also told citizens on Friday that the Rafah crossing might open Saturday for a five-hour window to allow Canadians to exit. Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly told reporters Saturday that the \u201clatest information\u201d she had was that \u201cviolence\u201d in the area forced authorities to cancel the operation. She did not elaborate.\n\nOn Friday, Okal and his extended family had rushed south from  Jabalya in the north of Gaza after the Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate. They scrambled frantically to find cars to fit them all and a place to stay near the crossing.\n\nOkal, 36, and his family spent hours waiting under the hot sun Saturday. He said there were several hundred people there, including another American family from New Jersey. He said there were other foreign nationals too, including Canadians, Swedes, Spaniards and Norwegians.\n\nAs the day dragged on, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, took their exhausted toddler, Yousef, back to the home where they are staying with 30 other people, a short drive away. Food vendors near the crossing warned Okal that it was not safe to stay once the sun set. Still, he remained there until nearly 6 p.m., he said, hoping something might change. When he began to hear the sound of fighter planes and drones, he knew he had to leave the area."

    "description": "Mounting Middle Eastern anger overshadowed President Biden\u2019s visit to Israel, at least temporarily disrupting U.S. efforts to de-escalate regional tensions.",
    "content": "Biden announced that a deal had been struck with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to flow from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million people face relentless airstrikes and an Israeli siege. Supplies of food, drinking water and fuel are dwindling by the hour. Despite the apparent breakthrough, Biden said the aid would not start arriving until Friday at the earliest.\n\nConcerned that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a broader regional conflict, the White House has tried to assure Arab partners that it will use its influence to protect innocent Gazans. Conditions in the enclave \u2014 already one of the poorest and most densely populated places in the world \u2014 are deteriorating rapidly. More than 3,000 people have been killed by airstrikes. Local hospitals are collapsing.\n\nBiden spent a little over seven hours in Israel, where he was greeted on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two men \u2014 whose decades-long relationship has been tested this year \u2014 shared a brief hug. Biden spent more than two hours at a meeting of the Israeli war cabinet before speaking with survivors of the attacks and families of victims and hostages.\n\nNetanyahu emphasized Wednesday that Israel would not permit the transfer of any humanitarian aid to Gaza from its own territory, but said it would not thwart the delivery of supplies from Egypt, provided it was limited to \u201cfood, water and medicine for the civilian population\u201d \u2014 and so long as none of it reached Hamas.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday called on residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the town of al-Mawasi, the latest in a series of recent directives urging Gazans to move south, even though most have nowhere to stay. The United Nations has warned that the evacuation orders may violate international law.\n\nThere was little acknowledgment in the region of Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility for the hospital strike, or of Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalizing ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d"

When Okal\u2019s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far \u2014 even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.\n\nIf his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws."

    "description": "The violence in Israel and Gaza has reignited tensions on U.S. college campuses over a conflict that for decades has fueled student and faculty activism.",
    "content": "The violence in Israel and Gaza has reignited tensions on U. S. college campuses over a conflict that for decades has fueled student and faculty activism, and divided academic communities. The reaction at Vanderbilt is just one example of the tightrope some college leaders appear to be attempting: renouncing the violence and pleading for security and civility on their campuses, while often sidestepping the contentious politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAt Vanderbilt, it was unclear why the university took down the chancellor\u2019s earlier statement about the war. When The Washington Post asked if it had been pulled because of criticism, Vanderbilt spokesperson Julia Jordan said that the \u201cstatement from the chancellor,\u201d as it was labeled online, was actually not a \u201cstatement.\u201d\n\nHigher education has long provided a staging ground for contentious debates related to Israel, whether it\u2019s students pushing for universities to divest from the nation or protesters clashing with campus speakers on either side of the political divide. But the immediacy of the current conflict has created what some students described as a profound unease on campuses, however far they may be geographically from the front lines of the war.\n\nChanie Goldman, co-director of the Chabad Jewish Student & Community Center at UF, said that a loud sound during the vigil \u2014 apparently a steel water bottle hitting the ground \u2014 was misinterpreted by some as a gunshot. Students had arrived at the event fearing something might happen, she said, and it didn\u2019t take much to cause alarm. \u201cJewish kids are very scared and very on edge,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rough time now.\u201d\n\nSome students said this week they hoped to set politics aside and focus on the profound loss of life. Jacob Bigelman, a junior at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said he was so distraught by the events in Israel, where he had studied during a gap year after high school, that he couldn\u2019t focus in the library on Sunday morning. Instead, he channeled his energy into organizing a vigil. \u201cLet\u2019s just do something,\u201d Bigelman recalls telling a friend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously going to be time to engage in talks about all that is going on and all that\u2019s unfolding,\u201d Bigelman said in an interview Monday. \u201cBut our message [at the vigil] was about unity and being just one strong Jewish community. I told one of our rabbis, I was so blind to how large and how strong the Jewish student body on campus is.\u201d\n\nJohaer Jilani, a student director of the Muslim Students Association National, said he worried that any \u201cgeopolitical event\u201d of this kind might trigger anti-Muslim sentiment. Jilani, a medical student at Howard University, said he condemns violence against civilians, whether perpetrated by Palestinians or Israelis. He expressed disappointment, however, that university leaders have not generally given voice to the Palestinian cause. This is particularly regrettable, Jilani said, given how Muslim students have rallied in support of other social justice and liberation causes, such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the Ukrainian resistance, which are widely embraced in higher education.\n\nDiverging views on the conflict are already creating divisions on campuses. Over the weekend, Students for Justice in Palestine at Rutgers University issued a statement standing with the \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d and calling the attack on Israel a \u201cjustified retaliation.\u201d The message was deeply offensive to Jewish students, said Lisa Harris Glass, chief executive of Rutgers Hillel, one of the nation\u2019s largest chapters. In addition, she said stickers with QR codes leading to an Arabic language website were placed on bollards outside the organization\u2019s building, which Glass interpreted as hostile. Hillel requested and received additional security in response, she said."

    "description": "The Wexner Foundation will stop funding fellowships at the Ivy League institution. Harvard was criticized for responding slowly to a student letter blaming Israel for the Hamas attack.",
    "content": "The Wexner Foundation, a philanthropic organization focused on cultivating Jewish leadership, is cutting ties with Harvard over what it described as the university\u2019s inadequate response to Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack, which killed at least 1,400 people in Israel. Why are Israel and Hamas at war? A basic explainer.The split is the most recent development in an ongoing controversy at the Ivy League university resulting from a statement signed by a coalition of Harvard student groups in response to the attack, which said that the Israeli government was \u201centirely responsible for all unfolding violence.\u201d Critics have said that Harvard was too slow to respond to the letter and not forceful enough when it did.\n\nThe university has become a microcosm of tensions arising at U. S. higher education institutions, where donors have distanced themselves and protests have broken out on campuses \u2014 all over responses to the war.\n\nIn a Monday letter, the Wexner Foundation wrote that it is \u201cstunned and sickened\u201d by Harvard\u2019s failure to \u201ctake a clear and unequivocal stand\u201d against Hamas\u2019s \u201cbarbaric murders\u201d of civilians in Israel, particularly after the student letter.\n\nFor more than 30 years, The Wexner Foundation, founded by Leslie Wexner, a controversial billionaire retailer, has partnered with the university to fund fellowships for Israeli government and public service professionals to pursue a master\u2019s degree at Harvard Kennedy School. The organization donated more than $2.4 million to Harvard in the 2021 fiscal year, the Boston Globe reported. In the letter this week addressed to the Harvard Board of Overseers, the foundation writes that the two \u201care no longer compatible partners\u201d and they will seek other ways to develop Israel\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn a statement, Harvard Kennedy School pointed to leaders\u2019 recent public condemnations of Hamas and said they are \u201cgrateful to the Wexner Foundation for its very longstanding support of student scholarships.\u201d\n\nThe Harvard students\u2019 letter was considered incendiary as it did not mention Hamas and blamed the Oct. 7 killings on what they called Israel\u2019s \u201capartheid regime.\u201d For years, \u201cmillions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison,\u201d the groups write, invoking an analogy often used by human rights organizations to describe Israel\u2019s blockade on the densely populated strip, which has limited Palestinian movement for more than 15 years. The groups pointed to targeted killings and family separations among other struggles, and called on Harvard to \u201ctake action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians.\u201d\n\nBacklash to the letter came swiftly, including from fellow students, prompting some signatories to publicly retract their signatures. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a Harvard graduate, said it was \u201cintellectually weak and morally repugnant,\u201d writing in a statement that, \u201cTerrorism is never justified nor someone else\u2019s fault\u201d and \u201cyou can stand up for Palestinian rights while condemning Hamas terrorists.\u201d\n\nWhen Harvard did not immediately respond to the letter, the university\u2019s former president Lawrence H. Summers wrote on social media that he was \u201cdisillusioned and alienated\u201d and that the silence allowed the institution to \u201cappear at best neutral toward acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s President Claudine Gay in a later statement condemned the \u201cterrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas,\u201d and added that the student groups that signed the letter do not speak for the university. Harvard Divinity School released a statement on Oct. 11 calling for acknowledging \u201cdecades of oppression\u201d faced by Palestinians when considering \u201cthe story about Hamas\u2019 horrendous attack on Israeli civilians.\u201d\n\nFor the Wexner Foundation and others, the administration\u2019s actions were not forceful enough. A letter from Harvard faculty members said that the student groups\u2019 letter \u201ccould have been a teaching moment\u201d to remind students that \u201csome acts such as war crimes are simply wrong.\u201d The statement \u201cfell short\u201d and \u201cfailed to condemn the justifications for violence that come from our own campus,\u201d the faculty members wrote.\n\nKenneth Griffin, a billionaire who pledged $300 million to Harvard earlier this year, urged Harvard to more forcefully defend Israel in a call to a senior Harvard leader, the New York Times reported. Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer and his wife Batia quit the Harvard executive board, saying in a statement to CNN that they \u201cdenounce those who seek to place blame on the people of Israel.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, students accused of signing the letter have faced threats and doxing (publishing a person\u2019s private information on the internet). Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman wrote on social media last week that he had been asked by \u201ca number of CEOs\u201d if Harvard would release the names of members of organizations that issued the letter, so they could avoid hiring them. A billboard truck drove around campus with photos and names of the students said to have signed the letter, labeling them \u201cantisemites.\u201d\n\nThe human rights and literary organization PEN America condemned the \u201charassment of any students, regardless of their viewpoint\u201d and called the campaign against the students \u201can undeniable threat to freedom of expression.\u201d"

Two of her children have been taken hostage by Hamas. (Ofir Berman for The Washington Post) TEL AVIV \u2014 At 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 7, Hadas Kalderon received the last message from her son.\u201cMom, be quiet, don\u2019t move,\u201d Erez, 12, texted. Hamas militants had stormed his father\u2019s house, in their southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Oz, where he and his 16-year-old sister, Sahar, had spent the night. Erez and his sister had jumped out the window and were hiding in the bushes. But he was thinking of his mother, just down the road, trying to protect her. Gunmen were rampaging through their tiny pastoral community, shooting entire families, some at point-blank range, as they clung to each other in beds and safe rooms.\u201cI love you forever. I hope you survive,\u201d she texted back. There was no reply.For hours, Hadas called Erez\u2019s cellphone again and again, even as she fought for her life, physically blocking militants from breaking down her safe room door. She heard them screaming, \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d as they set fire to parts of her home.When Israeli forces finally arrived in the late afternoon, the Kalderon family emerged from hiding, and Hadas\u2019s older daughter found an 18-second video circulating on social media. It showed Erez in a black T-shirt, being gripped by both arms and led into captivity. The militants referred to Erez and another group of children who do not appear in the shot as \u201cchild settlers.\u201dKalderon has replaced eating and sleeping with chain-smoking. Her voice is raw from overuse. She is in a \u201cliving hell,\u201d she said, having told her children for years not to be afraid. Now, \u201cthe nightmare has come true.\u201dFive members of the family were taken, including Erez, Sahar and their 50-year-old father, Ofer; their 80-year-old grandmother, Carmela, and a 12-year-old cousin, Noya, were grabbed from another house in the community. There are 203 people being held hostage in Gaza, according to the Israeli government, including civilians with passports from at least 31 other countries.Hadas\u2019s childhood friend from Nir Oz, whose relatives are also being held in Gaza, has commandeered her cellphone, shielding her from the relentless, looping horrors on social media \u2014 the celebrations of the bloodshed, the parading of humiliated captives, some stripped down to their underwear, others huddled together in what could be Hamas\u2019s vast network of tunnels. In one case, militants uploaded a video showing the killing of an elderly woman to her own Facebook page. Her granddaughter discovered it.The militants\u2019 decision to film their reign of terror has deepened the anguish of Israelis, but it has also given experts in Israel\u2019s vaunted cybersecurity and intelligence sectors a great deal of evidence to work with. They are leading a grass-roots effort now to comb through the footage and the photographs for clues about where hostages are being held.\u201cThe state has the tools and the information, but they don\u2019t have the apparatus to work as quickly as we do,\u201d said Ido Har-Tuv, a former member of Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s secretive national security service, and the chief executive of Gitam BBDO \u2014 an advertising agency that has opened a makeshift \u201cwar room\u201d out of its offices in a gleaming high-rise in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hahayal, Israel\u2019s Silicon Valley.\u201cWe\u2019re running our operation here like a lean, efficient start-up,\u201d Har-Tuv said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time.\u201dMany of the roughly 100 men and women in the \u201cwar room\u201d have deep military and intelligence experience, and some are being called up by Israel\u2019s most elite units. They include 8200, the Israeli military\u2019s cyberintelligence division, and Duvdevan, its undercover counterterrorism unit, which was the basis for the Netflix series \u201cFauda.\u201dRefael Franco, the former deputy head of the National Cyber Directorate, is overseeing the construction of the group\u2019s platform, which is based on cutting-edge AI and facial recognition technology. It is a sophisticated system that cross-checks images posted by militants posted on social media against photos of the hostages provided by families. When a match occurs, the system can geolocate \u2014 within seconds \u2014 the approximate location of a missing person. Open-source intelligence experts then try to zero in further, relying on contextual clues like mosques, local shops or the angle of the sun.The teams have already built a database of an estimated 1,000 people, including hostages and hostage takers. They are getting personnel and logistical help from Google, which has offices across town. They have shared their platform with Israeli security officials, who will use it to further their own search.Hamas took at least 64 captives into Gaza, visual evidence suggestsBut it is a time-consuming and inexact process. One of the biggest challenges, Franco said, is that hostages have been moved repeatedly.\u201cThat being said, every time someone picks up their phone and uploads footage in the strip, we can cross-check it in the system to know where they are,\u201d he said. They will keep following the digital clues, he said, for \u201cas long as this mission takes.\u201dMost of the videos were filmed and posted during or shortly after the initial abductions, flooding social media sites such as Telegram, Facebook, Snapchat and X, formerly known as Twitter \u2014 oftentimes all at once. Many were easy to find because they were posted with the same set of hashtags. In rare instances, Palestinian gunmen could be heard discussing where to take their captives.One set of videos, believed to be filmed by militants and passersby in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, showed a hostage being led by gunmen; on a wall in the background was a phone number of a local businessman, tipping off the team to the neighborhood.\u201cWe\u2019re figuring all of this out as we go,\u201d said one volunteer, among a group hunched over their laptops as they toggled through spreadsheets filled with translated posts, hashtags and geolocations.The man spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a reservist with Duvdevan. As time goes on, he said, the militants are posting less and, when they do, they are focusing more on themselves and their injuries.And as Israel expands its punishing air campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 3,700 people, hostage takers may lose electricity or cell reception and go dark entirely.Kalderon has not turned on the news since the attack. All she knows is that 80 of her 400 neighbors are dead or missing. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.She was unaware of the grass-roots efforts to locate the hostages, but she was not surprised. Across Israel, civilians have mobilized to provide aid to victims in the south and equipment to the troops, filling gaps left by the government.For a week and a half, Kalderon and her relatives heard nothing from Israeli officials about the status of their loved ones, or efforts to bring them home.On Wednesday, a military notification officer told Kalderon that her mother, Carmela \u2014 a peacenik immigrant from New York who for years helped Gazans receive medical treatment in Israel \u2014 and her autistic niece Noya \u2014 who was sleeping over at her grandmother\u2019s \u2014 were both dead. There was no information about the others.Kalderon and other relatives of hostages say have they experienced a double trauma: first left to fend for themselves when militants overran their communities, now left to navigate a deafening silence from their government.\u201cEvery second, every second, that our children are there is one second too much, and yet all Netanyahu talks about is \u2018winning the war,\u2019\u201d said Kalderon, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.He has met with only a handful of families \u2014 days after President Biden and members of his administration first reached out to them \u2014 and has provided few assurances.Kalderon, who also holds French citizenship, has met with French diplomats, including former prime minister Manuel Valls. But she is terrified that her own government, in preparing for a full-scale invasion of Gaza, may cast her children off as collateral damage.\u201cWe are simple people; we are good citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gave whatever we could to our country. It\u2019s the Israeli government that just forgot us.\u201dIsrael-Gaza war: Israel\u2019s military said it rescued two hostages from the southern Gazan city of Rafah while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing political pressure to reach a hostage release deal, after rejecting a cease-fire and vowing to continue war.Middle East conflict: Tensions in the region continue to rise. As Israeli troops aim to take control of the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, officials in Cairo warn it would undermine the 1979 peace treaty. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a diplomatic scramble to avert full-scale war between Israel and Lebanon.U.S. involvement: U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria killed dozens of Iranian-linked militants, according to Iraqi officials. The strikes were the first round of retaliatory action by the Biden administration for an attack in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops.Middle East conflict live updates: CIA Director Burns in Egypt for hostage talks; Gazans look to flee RafahMiddle East conflict live updates: CIA Director Burns in Egypt for hostage talks; Gazans look to flee RafahBiden and Jordanian king warn about planned Israeli invasion of RafahBiden and Jordanian king warn about planned Israeli invasion of RafahPanic mounts in Rafah over looming Israeli offensive after night strikesPanic mounts in Rafah over looming Israeli offensive after night strikes"

    "description": "What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.",
    "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, \u201cto lull Israel into complacency,\u201d while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters\u2019 apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n\u201cThose who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,\u201d said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried \u201cdata files on the territories and settlements they raided.\u201d\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: \u201cThe responsibility is mine,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cDespite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately \u2026 we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack."

    "description": "For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state.",
    "content": "These and other incidents have rattled Jewish communities on campuses across America as they mourn victims of the Oct. 7 massacres and kidnappings. For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state. But the outbreak of war has elevated those tensions even further in recent days and raised new alarms about intimidation and antisemitism on campus.\n\nColleges and universities usually take pride in hosting demonstrations and debate, as long as no one gets hurt. Fiery rhetoric is tolerated and often encouraged as students and faculty members engage on politics, the climate, the economy, racism and war. But Jewish leaders say that too often debates over the Middle East take a problematic turn, leading to a threatening atmosphere for Jewish students. For them, that phenomenon is not new.\n\n\u201cThe campus climate for Jewish students has been degrading over several years, and that has been aggravated by broader increases in antisemitism and virulent demonization of Israel on campuses,\u201d Adam Lehman, president and chief executive of the Jewish organization Hillel International, said in an interview. Lehman said the climate in recent days has worsened.\n\nAfter the surprise Hamas attack that left more than 1,400 people dead in Israel and thousands more wounded, the Georgia Tech chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi hung a banner from a balcony that declared solidarity with Israel. On Saturday, its members found the pro-Palestinian message written in shaving cream underneath the banner. The message was washed off, but it left a deeper impression: Their home, the fraternity members felt, had been violated.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the defacing of our property that was committed last weekend,\u201d the chapter said in a statement. \u201cAs a Jewish fraternity, we have all been deeply affected by the current events in Israel, and we are profoundly disheartened to see that this conflict has allowed antisemitism to gain a foothold on our campus. With our fellow Jews under attack in Israel, we feel that it is important to visibly display our support for the Israeli people as Jewish leaders at Georgia Tech.\u201d\n\nAt Stanford, the Jewish news organization the Forward reported last week, an instructor had asked Jewish and Israeli students in a class to identify themselves, take their belongings and stand in a corner. The apparent point of the exercise, according to the article, was to show students how the instructor believed Israel treats the Palestinians.\n\nUniversity leaders acknowledged in an Oct. 11 statement that they had received a report of a class in which an instructor \u201caddressed the Middle East conflict in a manner that called out individual students in class based on their backgrounds and identities.\u201d Stanford President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez said the instructor, who was not identified, \u201cis not currently teaching\u201d while the university in California investigates. \u201cWithout prejudging the matter, this report is a cause for serious concern,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAt Tufts University in Massachusetts, Micah Gritz, 21, a senior from Rockville, Md., who is a leader in a group called Jewish on Campus, said he was horrified to read an email in which a campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine used paraglider emojis to advertise a rally in nearby Cambridge. The email also praised \u201cliberation fighters\u201d \u2014 an allusion to Hamas militants \u2014 who had used paragliders in the cross-border attack and showed \u201ccreativity necessary to take back stolen land.\u201d\n\nCornell was roiled after an associate professor of history, Russell Rickford, spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in Ithaca, N. Y. The Cornell Daily Sun, a student newspaper, and others published video of his remarks. In the speech, Rickford cited \u201cmany Gazans of goodwill, many Palestinians of conscience, who abhor violence \u2014 as do you, as do I.\u201d But he also said many who support the Palestinian cause had strong feelings after learning of the Oct. 7 attack.\n\n\u201cIt was exhilarating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was energizing. And if they weren\u2019t exhilarated by this challenge to the monopoly of violence, by this shifting of the balance of power, then they would not be human. I was exhilarated.\u201d\n\nBut he told the Cornell Daily Sun that he believed the Hamas attack signaled that \u201cthe Palestinian will to resist had not been broken.\u201d He acknowledged that in subsequent days, \u201cwe learned of some of the horrifying realities.\u201d\n\nMartha E. Pollack, Cornell\u2019s president, and Kraig H. Kayser, chairman of the university\u2019s board of trustees, rebuked Rickford in a statement Tuesday and said the university was reviewing the matter. Faculty members at universities, especially those with tenure protections, are often given significant leeway in matters of free speech and academic freedom."

    "description": "The Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza\u2019s oldest active church, was sheltering hundreds of Muslims and Christians displaced by the war, according to religious officials.",
    "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 The historic Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza\u2019s oldest active church, was struck Thursday by Israel as it sheltered hundreds of Palestinians displaced by the war, according to religious officials. Maher Ayyad, 72, a member of the community, said the strike hit a two-story building in the church compound, killing 18 people and injuring at least 20. About 100 people were in the bombed building at the time of the strike, he said, and about 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.\n\nAmash tweeted Friday afternoon that several relatives who had been sheltering in the church, including two women he identified as Viola and Yara, were killed in the strike.\n\nThere are about 1,000 Palestinian Christians remaining in Gaza, and the loss was \u201chuge\u201d for the community, Ayyad said. About 500 Christians, including Ayyad, have relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.\n\nThe Washington Post geolocated the strike and confirmed the location of the church based on a video that shows people searching through rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem blamed Israel for the strike.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in an emailed statement that a strike targeting a Hamas control center \u201cdamaged the wall of a church in the area\u201d and that it was \u201caware of reports on casualties\u201d and was reviewing the incident. They declined to provide further information and reiterated, \u201cIt is important to clarify that the Church was not the target of the strike.\u201d\n\nAyyad is also a medical director at al-Ahli Hospital, where a blast Tuesday killed 471 people and injured more than 300, according to Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Israel has disputed that death toll.\n\nThe Order of St. George, an associated order of the church, issued a statement confirming Thursday\u2019s strike. \u201cArchbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don\u2019t know if he is injured,\u201d the Order of St. George stated. The blast hit \u201ctwo church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping.\u201d\n\nThe Church of St. Porphyrius\u2019s original structure dated to the 5th century, and the current structure, in a historic quarter of the city, was built in the 12th century. It is named for a former bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, and placed where he is believed to have died in A. D. 420. The church, characterized by thick walls and a richly decorated interior, has long been a place of refuge and community for its members, who are a religious minority in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA Palestinian American woman who moved from Gaza to the United States in the early 2000s said in an interview that she had relatives and friends sheltering in the church at the time of the strike, some of whom were injured.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re terrified. They\u2019re shaken. They don\u2019t know what to do, and they don\u2019t know where else to go,\u201d said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her family\u2019s safety. She expressed outrage at the idea that more than 1 million civilians could evacuate from a place as densely populated and heavily bombed as Gaza City \u2014 a mass movement called for by Israel last week. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that she grew up going to the Church of St. Porphyrius and that her family has deep ties to the church, dating to when they became refugees during the 1948 founding of Israel and mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nDescribing the congregation as close-knit and family-like, she said she\u2019s not only worried about her relatives. \u201cI\u2019m concerned for everyone because we\u2019re a small community.\u201d\n\nChristians make up about 1 percent of Gaza\u2019s population and have faced restrictions and discrimination by the Hamas government, according to human rights groups. During the 2014 Gaza war, about 1,000 Palestinian Muslims fled Israeli shelling for the Church of St. Porphyrius, where graves were damaged by shrapnel from a nearby strike, Reuters reported."

    "description": "What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.",
    "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, \u201cto lull Israel into complacency,\u201d while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters\u2019 apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n\u201cThose who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,\u201d said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried \u201cdata files on the territories and settlements they raided.\u201d\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: \u201cThe responsibility is mine,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cDespite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately \u2026 we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack."

    "description": "Iran is \u2018broadly complicit\u2019 in supporting Palestinian militants, but no evidence seen of a direct role in slaughter, officials say.",
    "content": "Hamas, the Gaza-based Palestinian militant organization that led the attack, has historically maintained a degree of independence from Tehran compared with true Iranian proxy groups such as the Lebanese-based Hezbollah. But in recent years, Hamas has benefited from massive infusions of Iranian cash as well as technical help for manufacturing rockets and drones with advanced guidance systems, in addition to training in military tactics \u2014 some of which occurred in camps outside Gaza, the officials said.\n\nU. S. and Israeli officials said they have no firm evidence so far that Iran authorized or directly coordinated the attack that killed more than 900 Israelis and wounded thousands. But current and former intelligence officials said the assault bore hallmarks of Iranian support, and noted officials in Tehran have boasted publicly about the huge sums in military aid provided to Hamas in recent years.\n\n\u201cIf you train people on how to use weapons, you expect them to eventually use them,\u201d said a Western intelligence official who, like others interviewed, requested that his name and nationality be withheld to freely discuss the rapidly unfolding events in southern Israel. The official, and a second Western analyst with access to sensitive intelligence, said the analysis conducted in the wake of the attack pointed to many months of preparation by Hamas, beginning at least as early as mid-2022.\n\nIn interviews, more than a dozen intelligence analysts and military experts expressed astonishment at the stealth and sophistication of the Hamas assault, which involved coordinated raids across the Israeli border by hundreds of gunmen traveling by land, sea and air \u2014 including motorized paragliders. The ground offensive was accompanied by swarms of rockets and drones that began streaking across the border early Saturday, hitting targets with a degree of precision not seen in previous Hamas attacks. While the Palestinian group has a capable militia and indigenous assembly lines for rockets and drones, an attack of Saturday\u2019s scale would have been extremely challenging without considerable outside help, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe amount of training, logistics, communication, personnel, and weapons required provides a massive footprint,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA senior operations officer who served in counterterrorism roles in the Middle East. \u201cThis suggests both Iranian involvement, given the complexity of the attack, and highlights the colossal intelligence failure.\u201d The use of paragliders \u2014 reminiscent of a spectacular 1987 attack by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Israel that killed several soldiers \u2014 \u201csurely required training outside of Gaza,\u201d Polymeropoulos said.\n\nJonathan Finer, the White House\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said in an interview with CBS News: \u201cWhat I can say without a doubt is that Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks. Iran has been Hamas\u2019s primary backer for decades. They have provided them weapons. They have provided them training. They have provided them financial support. And so, in terms of broad complicity, we are very clear about a role for Iran.\u201d\n\nIran denied a direct role in Saturday\u2019s attack, while also praising the Hamas militants who carried it out. \u201cWe are not involved in Palestine\u2019s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself,\u201d Tehran\u2019s mission to the United Nations said in a statement released Monday. But other Iranian officials publicly celebrated the attack while highlighting their close relationship with Hamas.\n\nCurrent and former intelligence officials confirmed that Iran had provided technical help to Hamas in manufacturing the more than 4,000 rockets and armed drones launched into Israel since Saturday. At least some Hamas militants also have undergone training in advanced military tactics, including at Lebanese camps staffed by technical advisers from Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018train the trainer\u2019 approach,\u201d Knights said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do a lot to train someone to be capable of operating a drone system, which is not complicated stuff anymore.\u201d On the other hand, he said, the combined-arms breaching capability exhibited during Saturday\u2019s assault \u201cclearly was practiced and carefully planned somewhere. A whole bunch of fortified positions fell to sophisticated combined arms-breaching attacks. And you don\u2019t just wing that.\u201d\n\nMichael Eisenstadt, director of the Washington Institute\u2019s Military and Security Studies Program, said that the relationship with Iran developed as a result of the Oslo peace process in the early 1990s when Tehran was looking for ways to scuttle efforts to forge a peace deal between the Palestinians and Israel. That was when Iran first provided the know-how for the explosive belts used by Palestinian suicide bombers.\n\nThe suicide bombing campaigns by both Hamas and Islamic Jihad had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the peace process, he said. Hamas launched its first homemade rocket, the Qassam, in 2001 during the second intifada. But it was very rudimentary, using pipes and a homemade fuel mixture derived from sugar and other common components.\n\n\u201cIran over the years has provided a lot of assistance to Hamas in terms of rocket capability,\u201d Eisenstadt said. \u201cThe signature weapon of Iran proxies are rockets, and increasingly missiles. You see that everywhere \u2014 with Iraq, Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah. That\u2019s very much inspired by Iranian example and advice.\u201d"

Israel\u2019s military says it has carried out more than 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. More than 1,100 people have been killed, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nThe Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes. Many were concentrated in heavily populated areas in the north.\n\nIsrael has pledged to focus its fire on Hamas fighters and abide by international law. Hamas said Wednesday that Israeli strikes targeted the head of its military wing, killing his brother. Two members of the group\u2019s political office were killed Tuesday.\n\nBut mosques, hospitals, residential buildings and international aid groups have also been hit. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that 13 health-care facilities were affected by the strikes. Nine U. N. staffers were killed in the strikes.\n\nGazans have lived under an Israeli blockade for 16 years. The 140-square-mile territory is among the most densely populated places on Earth. Of its 2 million people, about half are children \u2014 many have never been outside the strip.\n\nIsrael announced a complete siege of Gaza after the attacks. The country cut off power to the territory, leaving many residents in the dark. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials confirmed Gaza\u2019s sole power plant had run out of fuel. Access to water, sanitation facilities and health care will be affected by the outages, aid groups warned.\n\nAll crossings out of the enclave have been closed, leaving residents with nowhere to go.\n\nMore than 263,000 people are displaced across the strip, according to the U. N. Many have sought shelter in overcrowded U.N. schools. More than 1,000 housing units are estimated to have been destroyed.\n\nThe strikes are the beginning of what Israel has said will be its largest-ever offensive in Gaza, where people have already lived through multiple wars since Hamas seized power. Some 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up, the most in 50 years. Troops are massed on Gaza\u2019s border as Hamas continues to fire rockets into Israel."

    "content": "Three days after the deadliest attack in Israeli history, with at least 900 dead, the country is on the cusp of a long and bloody war in Gaza. More than 300,000 reservists have been called up to serve. But the capacity of Israel\u2019s military, long revered here as a source of stability, suddenly feels like a question mark. Equally unclear is the end game for Netanyahu \u2014 with his Gaza containment strategy in ruins, some are calling for a full reoccupation of the territory.\n\nSecurity experts say the war is the result of severe intelligence and military failures. Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been training for weeks near the Israeli border \u2014 drilling in rocket launches, kidnapping soldiers and \u201cstorming settlements,\u201d Gazan media reported. Yet the assessment from the Israeli military was that Hamas had no appetite for another conflict, a line repeated by trusted media figures.\n\n\u201cThe good news in the context of the Gaza Strip is that neither Israel nor Hamas want to see hostilities escalate, each for its own reasons,\u201d columnist Yoav Limor wrote last month in the right-wing newspaper Israel Hayom.\n\nAharon Zeevi Farkash, former head of  the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 military intelligence branch, told Israeli radio station Reshet Bet that \u201cafter we are able to probe this, we will see that we knew almost everything. There were intelligence assessments hours before. The question is, did we understand what we knew?\u201d\n\nThe IDF issued rare public statements in recent months, warning that military deterrence was deteriorating. Netanyahu and radical members of his cabinet derided the officials as part of the protest movement, and the protesters as \u201canarchists,\u201d asserting that the status quo with the Palestinians would hold.\n\n\u201cThe modus vivendi was that Hamas takes care of Gaza, Israel allows it to prosper, with the relatively small price that Israel paid every so often, with a round of violence in which Israel would kill thousands of Palestinians and Palestinians would kill dozens of Israelis \u2014 that was considered the best Israel could hope for,\u201d said Eran Etzion, former deputy head of Israel\u2019s national security council. \u201cNow that strategic equation has been completely violated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chaos that has been going on in the past year has created a situation that we\u2019re in now, of putting out fires,\u201d Brik said. \u201cA terror attack here, a terror attack there. They\u2019re not dealing with building the army.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s chaotic and delayed response to the multipronged assault was shocking to Israelis, who watched helplessly on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath and the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, as civilians in the south were left to fend for themselves against Hamas gunmen. Entire families were killed. Children and the elderly were taken to Gaza as hostages.\n\nThe surprise attack started around 6 a.m., with a barrage of rocket fire followed by cross-border attacks. Yet it wasn\u2019t until late afternoon that buses and trains were mobilized to ferry soldiers south. It took some 10 hours for the first troops to arrive in towns overrun by militants.\n\nThe Gaza border, it soon became clear, was minimally manned, and it took hours to redirect units stationed in the West Bank, which has been the main area of focus for the military this year. Palestinian militancy has surged in the occupied territory, from Jenin to Jericho, and Israeli raids have been increasingly common and deadly. Some in Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government had called to annex the West Bank. Gaza, by contrast, appeared stable.\n\n\u201cThere was a need for more soldiers, so where did they take them from? From the Gaza border, where they thought it was calm,\u201d said Farkash, the former IDF military intelligence chief. \u201cNot surprising that Hamas and Islamic Jihad noticed the low staffing at the border.\u201d\n\nHamas, designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, assumed power in Gaza in 2007 after Israel withdrew. For years, the group has been digging tunnels, amassing rockets and threatening to take hostages, part of a wider plan to \u201cliberate Palestine.\u201d It has publicly increased its cooperation with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, which has stepped up its provocations in recent months along Israel\u2019s northern border.\n\nAs Israel grapples with the fallout from the attack, many in the south still feel isolated and alone. Much of the most reliable information on the situation there continues to come from citizen networks rather than military officials, who on Monday asserted that towns in the south were \u201crecaptured\u201d despite ongoing fighting with militants.\n\nGaya Calderon, who texted with her 16-year-old sister moments before she, their brothers and their father were abducted by militants and taken to the Gaza Strip, said that she and other relatives of hostages have received no help or guidance \u2014 either from the army or the government."

    "description": "The aid convoy has been held up for days in Egypt at the only crossing to Gaza not controlled by Israel.",
    "content": "\u201cWe are witnessing a paradox: Behind these walls, we have 2 million people that is suffering enormously \u2014 that has no water, no food, no medicine, no fuel; that is under fire; that needs everything to survive,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cOn this side, we have seen so many trucks, loaded with water, with fuel, with medicines, with food \u2014 exactly the same things that are needed on this side of the wall.\u201d\n\nU. N. officials had hoped that Guterres\u2019s media tour Friday would coincide with the resumption of trucks driving across the border \u2014 a moment of triumph and relief after days of high-level, high-stakes diplomacy in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Instead, Guterres found himself facing stalled trucks and angry Egyptian aid workers, frustrated at the wait to bring assistance to Palestinians just a few miles away.\n\nThe aid convoy \u2014 and the difficult dealmaking to get it across the border \u2014 represent the opening gambit in efforts to seek a steady flow of relief supplies into Gaza. On Saturday, Egyptian officials plan to host a \u201csummit for peace,\u201d which Guterres is scheduled to attend before returning to New York.\n\nInside Gaza, however, Palestinians told The Washington Post that distributing the aid would be extremely dangerous for them without a halt in Israeli airstrikes, which have continued across the coastal enclave, including in areas in the south that Israel said would be considered safe zones.\n\nThat\u2019s a fraction of the more than 200 trucks from the United Nations, Egyptian Red Crescent and other sources that are ready to deliver supplies to Gaza. Guterres said the details of how the aid will be verified and whether it will be a continuous flow remain under discussion.\n\n\u201cWe are now actively engaged with\u201d Israel, Egypt and the United States, he said. \u201cThose verifications need to be effective, and at the same time, those verifications need to be done in a way that is practical and in a way that is expedited.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations has offered up their inspectors, who have conducted similar checks on aid entering northwest Syria. But a key sticking point has been that the Israelis want \u201cdirect eyes\u201d on the crossing, said an official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the delicate negotiations. \u201cThe question is where and how,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cWe demand the opening of the crossing so we can support our Palestinian brothers,\u201d said Abdelrahman El-Sayid, 22, a volunteer with Abnaa Sinai, a regional logistics company that also does charity work. He had been stuck there for four days, waiting to bring medicine and food aid across to Gaza, he said.\n\nAhead of his visit to the crossing, Guterres inspected a flight at the Arish airport carrying supplies destined for Gaza. The plane included 44 tons of food supplies donated by the United Arab Emirates, 17 tons of materials for tents and 10 tons of emergency trauma kits to be distributed by the United Nations and the Egyptian Red Crescent.\n\n\u201cWe need to have as quickly as possible the first convoy, and we need to create all the guarantees for that first convoy not to be the last,\u201d  Guterres told reporters on the tarmac.\n\nSince Oct. 7, Israel has tightened its siege on Gaza, and airstrikes have damaged parts of the Rafah crossing on the Gazan side. The war has also displaced around 1 million of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people. More than half of the displaced are sheltering in United Nation schools, hospitals and storage centers, according to the U. N.\u2019s refugee agency.\n\nAl-Qudra said Friday that seven hospitals were completely closed due to Israeli shelling and another 21 medical centers shut after running out of fuel. Fuel for the generators at al-Shifa Hospital, the main hospital in Gaza City and one of the few remaining places with electricity, will run out within 24 hours, Guillemette Thomas, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday."

    "description": "President links two conflicts as he makes a sweeping argument on America\u2019s global role",
    "content": "\u201cAmerican leadership is what holds the world together,\u201d he added. \u201cAmerican values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d\n\nThe speech culminated an extraordinary week for Biden, who set aside his schedule for a whirlwind trip into a war zone to appear alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The trip is likely to stand out as a signature moment of his presidency, though the outcome is far from certain as the Middle East remains engulfed in violent turmoil.\n\nWhile emphasizing the steadfast U. S. support of Israel, Biden reiterated his warning against being driven by fury. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, he said, \u201cWe made mistakes. So I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage. And here in America, let us not forget who we are.\u201d\n\nU. N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Thursday urged \u201crapid, unimpeded access for humanitarian aid\u201d to the Palestinian enclave, citing an \u201cever-mounting toll\u201d on civilians who have lacked water, food, fuel and electricity for more than a week. Hospitals in Gaza are being overrun with casualties from Israeli airstrikes, with patients sleeping on floors and some facilities turning off lights off to save energy, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nThe portion of the aid package going to Israel would be aimed at strengthening the country\u2019s Iron Dome air defense system, Biden said. The United States has already positioned two aircraft carriers and their escort ships near Israel and sent thousands of soldiers and Marines to staff them, driven by concern that the conflict could flare into a broader regional war.\n\nHe will have to overcome resistance from a significant number of House Republicans who have been agitating to slash aid to Ukraine \u2014 in some cases, to nothing. America, they argue, has little at stake in a faraway war between two remote countries, and the money would be better spent on such uses as securing America\u2019s southern border.\n\nPublic support for Ukraine is also slipping. A Washington Post-ABC poll last month found 41 percent of Americans said the United States was doing too much to support Ukraine, while 50 percent said it was doing about the right amount or too little. Among Republicans, however, 59 percent said the United States was doing too much to aid Kyiv.\n\nReflecting that dynamic, Biden spent a good portion of his address warning about the risks of abandoning Ukraine to Putin\u2019s aggression. He recalled the secretive trip he made to Kyiv in February with only a handful of security agents accompanying him, a visit that in some ways was similar to his trip Wednesday to Israel while it was in a state of war.\n\nAt least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the unprecedented cross-border Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities have said, when militants hunted down and attacked civilians. Palestinian officials have said that 3,785 people in Gaza have been killed and more than 12,400 wounded in the airstrikes that Israel has launched in response."

    "description": "As some major platforms ban Hamas, others take a laissez-faire approach.",
    "content": "On Google\u2019s YouTube and Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, you can stand with Israel, call for peace or lament the plight of Palestinians. But expressions of support for Hamas are forbidden. Both companies consider Hamas an extremist organization, meaning that no one affiliated with the group is allowed to use their platforms, and no videos or images created by Hamas can be posted there.\n\nIn contrast, the influential messaging platform Telegram does very little content moderation. It hosts a Hamas channel that has been openly broadcasting grisly footage and images of dead Israelis to more than 100,000 subscribers. And some of those posts have been rebroadcast on Elon Musk\u2019s X, formerly Twitter, which nominally prohibits Hamas content but appears to be doing relatively little to police it after Musk laid off the majority of the company\u2019s employees.\n\nExperts say X in particular has become a hub for posts and videos taken down by other platforms for violating their rules against graphic violence or hate speech. On Tuesday, European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton posted a letter to Musk warning him that regulators have \u201cindications\u201d that the site may be in violation of European rules on violent and terrorist content, as well as disinformation.\n\nIn the case of the Israel-Gaza war, those calls are complicated by a desire to avoid being seen as abetting a terrorist organization by enabling it to broadcast propaganda, threats, hostage videos or even executions. Facebook has been sued in the past by the families of people killed by Hamas. And earlier this year, Google, Twitter and Meta defended themselves at the Supreme Court against charges that they had materially aided the Islamic State terrorist group  by hosting or recommending its content, such as recruiting videos. (In each of those cases, the tech firms prevailed.)\n\nBut defining what counts as an extremist group isn\u2019t always straightforward, and social media platforms over the years have faced scrutiny over which government actors, political movements, military operations and violent regimes get a voice and which don\u2019t. After the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan in 2021, social media companies had to make a high-stakes decision about whether to continue to ban the Taliban, since it had taken over the country\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cWithin social media companies, the category that you\u2019re placed in determines how your speech is going to be treated,\u201d said Anika Collier Navaroli, senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and a former senior Twitter policy official. \u201cThe speech of a political party is going to be treated extremely different than the speech that comes from a terrorist. The speech from a legitimate nation-state is also going to be treated different than somebody who is not recognized as that.\u201d\n\nOn TikTok, both the #Israel and #Palestine hashtags have attracted tens of billions of views as young people turn to the platform for news and perspectives on the conflict. But at least one prominent account that covers news from a Palestinian perspective received a notice Monday that it had been permanently banned. TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said Tuesday that the ban was a mistake and that the account, Mondoweiss, was reinstated.\n\nSince Hamas\u2019s incursion began, TikTok has shifted more content moderators to focus on posts about the conflict, including posts in Arabic and Hebrew, Favazza said. It has also been blocking some hashtags associated with graphic violence or terrorist propaganda, including footage of hostages or executions. And it is working with fact-checkers to identify misinformation, though a quick browse through popular searches such as \u201cIsrael\u201d and \u201cGaza\u201d on Tuesday turned up numerous videos from previous, unrelated conflicts that were being presented as though they were new. Other videos racked up views with graphic footage of Israeli victims, likely produced originally by Hamas, with a thin veneer of commentary decrying the acts.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement that the company had established \u201ca special operations center\u201d with experts who are fluent in Hebrew and Arabic to closely monitor the situation. \u201cOur teams are working around the clock to keep our platforms safe, take action on content that violates our policies or local law, and coordinate with third-party fact checkers in the region to limit the spread of misinformation,\u201d Stone said.\n\nOn Telegram, an apparently official Hamas account with close to 120,000 subscribers has routinely posted grisly video of the attacks on Israel. One clip, with more than 77,000 views, showed an unidentified militant stomping on a dead soldier\u2019s face. Many of the videos have been reposted to X. At least one of the videos was also posted by the media outlet Al Jazeera Arabic to YouTube, where it has nearly 13 million subscribers, but with some of the gore blurred."

What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza.

Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades.

    "description": "To dismantle Hamas, the IDF would have to fight in Gaza\u2019s dense neighborhoods, adding to the risks civilians are facing.",
    "content": "Israeli troops are massing around the Gaza Strip, poised for a ground invasion that could involve heavy urban combat in the densely populated territory. The buildup of force comes after attackers from the militant group Hamas, which controls the enclave, crossed into southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces have already pummeled the strip with airstrikes, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nIsrael withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005. In 2008 and 2014, Israeli forces entered the territory in multiweek campaigns that Israel said were aimed at impeding Hamas\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThe fighting killed more than 3,500 Palestinians and more than 70 Israeli soldiers in total.\n\nThis operation may be much more extensive. Israel has vowed to \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas.\n\n\u201cBasically, what the Israelis are aiming for is complete regime change in Gaza, which is a notable break from\u201d past campaigns, said Raphael Cohen, a senior political scientist at Rand Corp. He expected a long, brutal fight. \u201cIf you want to root out Hamas, it\u2019s going to last a lot more than 50 days like Protective Edge,\u201d said Cohen, referring to the IDF\u2019s 2014 operation.\n\nMany civilians have already been killed in Gaza and 1 million have been displaced according to the United Nations.\n\n\u201cA ground campaign will inevitably have grave implications for civilians in Gaza,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe dense urban nature of the [Gaza Strip] will ensure that such an operation will face fierce resistance and will require massive use of force by Israel.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cHamas\u2019s practice of storing and using rockets and military assets among civilians and in humanitarian facilities will further increase the exposure of civilians to risk.\u201d\n\nTo dismantle Hamas, the IDF, one of the world\u2019s most powerful militaries, would have to fight in Gaza\u2019s dense neighborhoods with limited space to maneuver.\n\nHamas, which analysts say spent at least two years planning the rampage that caught Israeli forces by surprise, is likely to have prepared for a large-scale retaliation.\n\nA ground offensive into Gaza could compound the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis there.\n\nAn Israeli siege on the enclave has meant almost all its fuel and power are gone. Food, drinking water and medical supplies are running out.\n\n\u201cIt seems that major ground operations are likely to focus on Gaza City, at least initially, with perhaps limited ground incursions elsewhere,\u201d said Michael Eisenstadt, director of the military and security studies program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cBut air and naval artillery strikes are likely to continue against targets throughout the Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\nIsrael has urged Gazans to evacuate to the south, away from Gaza City, before a ground incursion, but on Tuesday the United Nations cited reports \u201cthat civilians attempting to relocate to southern Gaza were struck and killed by an explosive weapon.\u201d The southern Rafah crossing into Egypt remains closed.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this round even more concerning is that it is likely to extend for an unprecedented period of time, where civilians will not only be exposed to direct risk of death and injury from the fighting, but also to protracted, severe shortages of basic humanitarian needs,\u201d al-Omari said."

    "description": "The Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza\u2019s oldest active church, was sheltering hundreds of Muslims and Christians displaced by the war, according to religious officials.",
    "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 The historic Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, Gaza\u2019s oldest active church, was struck Thursday by Israel as it sheltered hundreds of Palestinians displaced by the war, according to religious officials. Maher Ayyad, 72, a member of the community, said the strike hit a two-story building in the church compound, killing 18 people and injuring at least 20. About 100 people were in the bombed building at the time of the strike, he said, and about 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.\n\nAmash tweeted Friday afternoon that several relatives who had been sheltering in the church, including two women he identified as Viola and Yara, were killed in the strike.\n\nThere are about 1,000 Palestinian Christians remaining in Gaza, and the loss was \u201chuge\u201d for the community, Ayyad said. About 500 Christians, including Ayyad, have relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.\n\nThe Washington Post geolocated the strike and confirmed the location of the church based on a video that shows people searching through rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem blamed Israel for the strike.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in an emailed statement that a strike targeting a Hamas control center \u201cdamaged the wall of a church in the area\u201d and that it was \u201caware of reports on casualties\u201d and was reviewing the incident. They declined to provide further information and reiterated, \u201cIt is important to clarify that the Church was not the target of the strike.\u201d\n\nAyyad is also a medical director at al-Ahli Hospital, where a blast Tuesday killed 471 people and injured more than 300, according to Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Israel has disputed that death toll.\n\nThe Order of St. George, an associated order of the church, issued a statement confirming Thursday\u2019s strike. \u201cArchbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don\u2019t know if he is injured,\u201d the Order of St. George stated. The blast hit \u201ctwo church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping.\u201d\n\nThe Church of St. Porphyrius\u2019s original structure dated to the 5th century, and the current structure, in a historic quarter of the city, was built in the 12th century. It is named for a former bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, and placed where he is believed to have died in A. D. 420. The church, characterized by thick walls and a richly decorated interior, has long been a place of refuge and community for its members, who are a religious minority in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA Palestinian American woman who moved from Gaza to the United States in the early 2000s said in an interview that she had relatives and friends sheltering in the church at the time of the strike, some of whom were injured.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re terrified. They\u2019re shaken. They don\u2019t know what to do, and they don\u2019t know where else to go,\u201d said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her family\u2019s safety. She expressed outrage at the idea that more than 1 million civilians could evacuate from a place as densely populated and heavily bombed as Gaza City \u2014 a mass movement called for by Israel last week. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that she grew up going to the Church of St. Porphyrius and that her family has deep ties to the church, dating to when they became refugees during the 1948 founding of Israel and mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nDescribing the congregation as close-knit and family-like, she said she\u2019s not only worried about her relatives. \u201cI\u2019m concerned for everyone because we\u2019re a small community.\u201d\n\nChristians make up about 1 percent of Gaza\u2019s population and have faced restrictions and discrimination by the Hamas government, according to human rights groups. During the 2014 Gaza war, about 1,000 Palestinian Muslims fled Israeli shelling for the Church of St. Porphyrius, where graves were damaged by shrapnel from a nearby strike, Reuters reported."

    "description": "The Gaza Strip, a 140-square-mile stretch of land with more than 2 million people, depends on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services.",
    "content": "Defense officials have ordered a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of Gaza after militants broke through its border wall into southern Israel on Saturday and killed at least 1,200 people, many of them civilians \u2014 the deadliest day in Israeli history. In Israel and Gaza, people brace for a long and costly war\u201cNo power, no food, no gas,\u201d Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. \u201cWe are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.\u201d Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, orchestrated the ambush over the weekend, when militants took more than 100 hostages to Gaza.\n\nIsrael has bombarded the densely populated enclave in retaliation, killing at least 1,100 people. On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that the border with Gaza was secured and that it was preparing for an offensive.\n\nThe Gaza Strip, a 140-square-mile stretch of land with more than 2 million people, depends on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Cutting off gas and power from the territory could leave many residents not only without power, but without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care. On Wednesday, Palestinian authorities said Gaza\u2019s only power plant has run out of fuel and stopped operating.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the siege Monday. \u201cThe humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIsrael provides Gaza with power in two ways. Gaza\u2019s sole power plant is operated by diesel fuel, which enters Gaza from the Karem Shalom crossing. There are also 10 direct power lines from Israel to Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli siege could also \u201cresult in a severe shortage of already scarce drinkable water,\u201d the United Nations said. The territory has several major desalination plants, which transform water from the Mediterranean Sea into drinkable water, but they need power to operate.\n\nSanitation facilities, too, could be crippled by the outages, increasing concerns about disease. Past fuel shortages in Gaza have caused sewage from the strip to contaminate agricultural land and spill into Israel.\n\nGaza \u201cwas on the edge of a humanitarian crisis for a very long time,\u201d said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East regional director of Mercy Corps. \u201cSo this additional shock is going to turn this into a full-blown crisis very quickly.\u201d\n\nIsrael withdrew its civilian population and military forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but has continued to control the flow of goods and people. When Hamas assumed political power of the territory in 2007, Israel imposed an air and sea blockade, which is also enforced by Egypt to the south.\n\nOver the course of the 16-year blockade, Israel has imposed shutdowns during key moments in the conflict, including Operation Cast Lead, which began in December 2008, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014. Those military campaigns killed more than 3,500 Palestinians in total.\n\n\u201cIsrael used its control over the access to goods and infrastructure needs as a way of creating a carrot-and-stick approach to the governing body in Gaza, Hamas,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf things are calm, things are opened up. If things get tense, Israel shuts the spigot.\u201d\n\nThe siege could also affect hospitals, which can run on generators but need fuel to power them. Several health-care facilities were already hit by Israeli strikes.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned to see that medical facilities have not been spared,\u201d L\u00e9o Cans, Doctors Without Borders\u2019 head of mission in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement. \u201c[An] airstrike destroyed an ambulance carrying the wounded, right in front of the hospital where we work.\u201d\n\nIsrael has justified its overwhelming use of force by saying it must destroy Hamas\u2019s military capabilities to prevent any future assaults on the country."

    "description": "What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.",
    "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, \u201cto lull Israel into complacency,\u201d while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters\u2019 apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n\u201cThose who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,\u201d said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried \u201cdata files on the territories and settlements they raided.\u201d\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: \u201cThe responsibility is mine,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cDespite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately \u2026 we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack."

    "description": "Dire scenarios await Gaza\u2019s hospitals as they face dwindling basic resources and damage from airstrikes in the Israel-Gaza war.",
    "content": "The Gaza Strip\u2019s health-care system stands on the brink of collapse as bombings damage hospitals and ambulances and as generators run out of fuel, highlighting how quality medical care is a casualty of war. Dire scenarios await Gaza\u2019s medical professionals. They face dwindling basic resources such as power, water and anesthesia, compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save. The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health-care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human-made and natural disasters \u2014 assessing staffing and other resources, managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones, and looking out for their own welfare.\n\n\u201cWhen we are in a disaster setting or conflict, we usually have more patients than resources. We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people,\u201d said Lindsey Ryan Martin, who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza.\n\n\u201cHealth workers, why would they stay?\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cAnd how can you move the sick people that we\u2019ve already been discussing for the last few days, coming out of the hospital in Gaza City \u2014 how can you move them when they\u2019re in ICUs?\u201d\n\nAn anesthesia specialist at al-Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed. He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene: patients being treated on a teal floor, a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient.\n\nThe hospital worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters, worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply. He\u2019s already seeing infections, diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children.\n\nThe hospital worker said he last slept properly on Oct. 5, before the conflict began, and doesn\u2019t know whether his home is still standing. \u201cIt\u2019s also the last time I saw my wife and my kids,\u201d he said.\n\nErica L. Nelson, who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years, said Palestinian doctors at al-Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted. \u201cThe additional component of \u2018We are at risk\u2019 has changed the tenor of the conversation,\u201d said Nelson, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply. Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d according to Doctors Without Borders, which has staff on the ground in Gaza. The U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients. All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel.\n\n\u201cWhen fuel runs out, that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that don\u2019t require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services,\u201d said John Broach, director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester, Mass.\n\nBroach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated, such as people with well-managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies.\n\n\u201cSoon all the team is burned out, their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions,\u201d said Callaway, who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine.\n\nThe decisions health-care workers face in disasters are momentous: As they focus on the patient in front of them, they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere. \u201cYou feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cIs a kid\u2019s life more valuable than an elderly person\u2019s?\u201d\n\nResources simply were not available to treat everyone in need, he said. \u201cYou can be forced into a situation where you can\u2019t do what\u2019s best for your patient, either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die,\u201d Kirsch said.\n\nPaul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do. As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide, Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could, amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures. \u201cYou have no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tell yourself you\u2019ll probably do it better than a layperson.\u201d\n\nThe health-care system in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, already struggled before the war. The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods, which can restrict care. Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014, when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50-day Israeli offensive in Gaza."

    "description": "Humanitarian experts warned of many obstacles before Palestinians in need receive support.",
    "content": "Wrapping up a trip to Israel on Wednesday, Biden told reporters that up to 20 trucks of aid from Egypt would be allowed into the enclave through the Rafah border crossing once potholes along the road and damage from Israeli airstrikes had been repaired. Humanitarian officials warned, however, that a host of issues must still be resolved before the trucks can start moving.\n\n\u201cThe diplomats are way behind in responding to an exploding emergency,\u201d said Jan Egeland, secretary general for the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cYou now need a cease fire and you need massive access across several crossing points, even to be close to responding to the most acute needs as the entire population is now destitute.\u201d\n\nThe Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas, has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years, leaving most of its 2.3 million residents dependent on aid even before the current conflict. Those deliveries stopped entirely when Israeli and Egyptian border crossings into Gaza were closed after Hamas militants killed at least 1,400 people in a surprise assault on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7.\n\nAn initial aid delivery will ease the crisis, experts said, but only fleetingly. \u201cWhat is needed is consistent and unimpeded aid access into and within Gaza, not only for the entry of and safe passage of supplies but also for humanitarians to be able to undertake their work safely,\u201d said Emma Beals, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute who researches the distribution of aid in conflict zones.\n\n\u201cWe need more than just a promise that aid is allowed to go in,\u201d Martin Griffiths, the emergency relief coordinator who oversees humanitarian aid at the United Nations, told The Washington Post on Wednesday. \u201cAid must go in at scale and daily.\u201d U. N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres echoed that point upon arriving in Cairo early Thursday, telling reporters he is seeking agreement on \u201csustained\u201d humanitarian relief.\n\nBut U. S. officials were quick to describe the first trucks as a test balloon, with no guarantee of future deliveries if Hamas will interfere. \u201cIf Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people,\u201d Biden said, speaking aboard Air Force One as he departed Israel. \u201cAs a practical matter it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.\u201d\n\nHumanitarian officials emphasized the United Nations has established monitoring mechanisms in place for aid that crosses into Gaza. The European Union also has an assistance mission that operates at the Rafah border crossing in Egypt and could be called upon to inspect the trucks upon entry. It was unclear Thursday whether these agencies had been contacted about helping to monitor the aid route.\n\nDiscussions on inspections were still \u201congoing,\u201d U. S. and U.N. officials told The Post on Thursday. News reports in Arab media and elsewhere that a deal had been reached were \u201cpremature,\u201d one official said. Another said the talks are \u201cclose, but not there yet.\u201d Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous to hold back emergency relief for children, women and families because they fear aid diversion. Most of the stuff that goes in, the fighting men are well stocked on, they do not need bottled water or baby powder,\u201d Egeland said, adding that existing monitoring mechanisms can and should be implemented without delay.\n\nMore than 100 aid trucks were lined up Thursday in the Egyptian city of Arish, waiting for a greenlight to move to Rafah. On the other side of the border, Palestinians struggled to understand why the initial deliveries would be so small or how they would actually reach people in Gaza.\n\nMohamed Zanoon, an independent photographer who was working to document the aftermath of the Israeli air raids, said he was witnessing a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d He has struggled to push from his mind the memories of children screaming beneath the rubble. \u201cTwenty trucks is not enough,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cMore than a million people need medical care in Gaza.\u201d\n\nAmong the thorniest remaining questions is whether fuel will be allowed on the trucks. Without its regular deliveries, the last power plant in Gaza went dark last week, robbing the enclave of regular electricity. Hospitals have since struggled to keep the lights on with diesel generators. Doctors warn a total blackout would be a death sentence for patients on life support, in the operating theater and to newborns in incubators.\n\nAs news of the impending deal filtered through Gaza, residents described the aid effort as a drop in the ocean, and they fretted over whether they would receive anything all. \u201cOkay, it is something,\u201d said Yousef Hammash, a father of two from Gaza City. \u201cAt least we have it. Now we have to have a truce to distribute it. How are they going to do it under bombardment?\u201d\n\nGriffiths, from the United Nations, said humanitarian officials have been engaged in \u201cincredibly detailed negotiations\u201d about what an aid program to southern Gaza would look like. He said relief workers need assurances that they will be able to deliver aid consistently and reach people where they are \u201cin the places that they choose to be safe.\u201d\n\nFor many Palestinians, nowhere in Gaza feels safe. The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Wednesday that Israeli warplanes bombed five bakeries in different locations, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds as they lined up to buy bread. Medics and aid workers have also been killed off duty, sometimes as they left work to check on their families.\n\n\u201cThe streets are not safe, and the entire population is in need,\u201d Hammash said. \u201cEvery day we have to do our challenging mission of getting bread and water.\u201d He moved his family from Gaza City to Khan Younis this week after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of over 1 million civilians in the northern part of the enclave. But the mass displacement has put such strain on resources in the south that Hammash said some people were now heading back home. \u201cEither you get bombed in the north or you die from hunger here,\u201d he said."

    "description": "The possibilities include Israel temporarily reoccupying Gaza, the return of the Palestinian Authority to the enclave and a disarmed Hamas still in power.",
    "content": "The shape of the next Israel-Gaza relationship may depend, among other factors, on what\u2019s left of Hamas, and Gaza, when the fighting stops. Already, Israel\u2019s air attacks have killed more than 2,600, according to Palestinian authorities, and begun to decimate public infrastructure.\n\nAs the shock wave from a Hamas rampage that killed 1,400 Israelis has swept away old assumptions, scenarios that seemed impossible just days ago could be in play: Israel reoccupying Gaza, at least temporarily; the return of the Palestinian Authority to the enclave; international peacekeepers; a demilitarized Hamas still technically holding government authority.\n\n\u201cWe need to see how long it will take to destroy Hamas. And then I believe there will be an international understanding with Israel for the day after,\u201d Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel said in an interview. \u201cBut now we need to put all our power into winning this war.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli public is widely and furiously behind that goal, for now. \u201cDestroy Gaza,\u201d reads a banner hanging over a highway in the left-leaning city of Tel Aviv. But past wars suggest the mood could shift \u2014 and international support could wane \u2014 if the expected ground war drags on and produces horrifying body counts.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military is more circumspect than its leading politicians have been. The Israel Defense Forces said they are gathering tanks and troops \u2014 one of the largest mobilizations in the country\u2019s history \u2014 with an operational goal of defeating Hamas and eliminating all senior officials involved. This would amount to a greatly expanded version of previous war aims, in which the IDF pulled out once it completed a target list meant to degrade Hamas\u2019s military capabilities.\n\nEven if Israel does kill every Hamas leader in Gaza and collapse every tunnel, \u201cdestroying\u201d the organization may not be possible, experts said. Hamas has leaders who are exiled but active and known to move around between Beirut, Istanbul and Doha, Qatar. And Hamas supporters can be found not just in Gaza but also throughout the West Bank, and elsewhere.\n\nIsrael is not willing to sacrifice any more of its soldiers\u2019 lives than is necessary, said Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. After what could be a brutal invasion, staying in Gaza to govern will have no appeal.\n\nA restoration of the authority, which is already viewed by many Palestinians as a corrupt agent of Israeli security agencies, would need to be carefully managed, he said. Its legitimacy would take another blow if Israel is seen as simply ushering in Palestinian Authority security forces when the IDF is ready to leave.\n\nSome analysts said the recent thaw in Israel\u2019s relations with Arab states could provide a way. Before the Hamas attack, Saudi Arabia was talking to the Biden administration about establishing ties with Israel. It\u2019s possible that Riyadh could play a role in brokering the Palestinian Authority\u2019s arrival in Gaza City.\n\nBut the willingness of Persian Gulf states, and other governments, to help Israel craft an endgame may depend on how the Gaza war concludes. The world was shocked by Hamas\u2019s brutality, but experience shows that civilian casualties and humanitarian agony in Gaza will erode public support."

    "content": "The Gaza Strip\u2019s health-care system stands on the brink of collapse as bombings damage hospitals and ambulances and as generators run out of fuel, highlighting how quality medical care is a casualty of war. Dire scenarios await Gaza\u2019s medical professionals. They face dwindling basic resources such as power, water and anesthesia, compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save. The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health-care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human-made and natural disasters \u2014 assessing staffing and other resources, managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones, and looking out for their own welfare.\n\n\u201cWhen we are in a disaster setting or conflict, we usually have more patients than resources. We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people,\u201d said Lindsey Ryan Martin, who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza.\n\n\u201cHealth workers, why would they stay?\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cAnd how can you move the sick people that we\u2019ve already been discussing for the last few days, coming out of the hospital in Gaza City \u2014 how can you move them when they\u2019re in ICUs?\u201d\n\nAn anesthesia specialist at al-Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed. He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene: patients being treated on a teal floor, a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient.\n\nThe hospital worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters, worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply. He\u2019s already seeing infections, diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children.\n\nThe hospital worker said he last slept properly on Oct. 5, before the conflict began, and doesn\u2019t know whether his home is still standing. \u201cIt\u2019s also the last time I saw my wife and my kids,\u201d he said.\n\nErica L. Nelson, who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years, said Palestinian doctors at al-Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted. \u201cThe additional component of \u2018We are at risk\u2019 has changed the tenor of the conversation,\u201d said Nelson, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply. Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d according to Doctors Without Borders, which has staff on the ground in Gaza. The U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients. All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel.\n\n\u201cWhen fuel runs out, that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that don\u2019t require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services,\u201d said John Broach, director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester, Mass.\n\nBroach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated, such as people with well-managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies.\n\n\u201cSoon all the team is burned out, their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions,\u201d said Callaway, who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine.\n\nThe decisions health-care workers face in disasters are momentous: As they focus on the patient in front of them, they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere. \u201cYou feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cIs a kid\u2019s life more valuable than an elderly person\u2019s?\u201d\n\nResources simply were not available to treat everyone in need, he said. \u201cYou can be forced into a situation where you can\u2019t do what\u2019s best for your patient, either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die,\u201d Kirsch said.\n\nPaul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do. As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide, Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could, amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures. \u201cYou have no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tell yourself you\u2019ll probably do it better than a layperson.\u201d\n\nThe health-care system in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, already struggled before the war. The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods, which can restrict care. Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014, when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50-day Israeli offensive in Gaza."

Israel has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza since Saturday, and they are still falling, even as hundreds of thousands of people try to move south.\n\n\u201cIn the following days, the IDF will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces said Friday, adding that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels beneath civilian homes and in heavily populated areas. \u201cCivilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields.\u201d\n\nJames Elder, spokesman for UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency, described agonizing conversations with staff members in northern Gaza: \u201cThe word \u2018impossible\u2019 was used so many times, in terms of, \u2018It\u2019s impossible for us to do this, they are asking the impossible.\u2019 I was talking to people through tears.

She doesn\u2019t know how they could leave, even if she could find a vehicle.\n\nIsrael sealed its land borders with Gaza after Hamas\u2019s attack Saturday, and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt \u2014 the last remaining exit \u2014 has been closed for days after Israeli strikes in the area. When it does reopen, only a small number of Gazans are likely to be able to cross to safety.\n\n\u201cPeople have been calling me all morning asking if I can help them find a place to stay,\u201d said Wesam Amer, a university lecturer who lives in Khan Younis and is already hosting extended family members. He doesn\u2019t know of a single building in the area that has space for more. And the people keep coming.\n\nInside the hospital, doctors say they are running out of resources and fear they could soon be plunged into darkness. Israel has imposed a total siege on Gaza, cutting electricity and deliveries of fuel. Health officials say al-Shifa only has three more days\u2019 worth of generator fuel; other Gaza hospitals could be out within a week."

The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden\u2019s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country\u2019s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza\u2019s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n\u201cWe all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,\u201d Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. \u201cThey go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?\u201d\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid."

Two of her children have been taken hostage by Hamas. (Ofir Berman for The Washington Post) TEL AVIV \u2014 At 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 7, Hadas Kalderon received the last message from her son.\u201cMom, be quiet, don\u2019t move,\u201d Erez, 12, texted. Hamas militants had stormed his father\u2019s house, in their southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Oz, where he and his 16-year-old sister, Sahar, had spent the night. Erez and his sister had jumped out the window and were hiding in the bushes. But he was thinking of his mother, just down the road, trying to protect her. Gunmen were rampaging through their tiny pastoral community, shooting entire families, some at point-blank range, as they clung to each other in beds and safe rooms.\u201cI love you forever. I hope you survive,\u201d she texted back. There was no reply.For hours, Hadas called Erez\u2019s cellphone again and again, even as she fought for her life, physically blocking militants from breaking down her safe room door. She heard them screaming, \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d as they set fire to parts of her home.When Israeli forces finally arrived in the late afternoon, the Kalderon family emerged from hiding, and Hadas\u2019s older daughter found an 18-second video circulating on social media. It showed Erez in a black T-shirt, being gripped by both arms and led into captivity. The militants referred to Erez and another group of children who do not appear in the shot as \u201cchild settlers.\u201dKalderon has replaced eating and sleeping with chain-smoking. Her voice is raw from overuse. She is in a \u201cliving hell,\u201d she said, having told her children for years not to be afraid. Now, \u201cthe nightmare has come true.\u201dFive members of the family were taken, including Erez, Sahar and their 50-year-old father, Ofer; their 80-year-old grandmother, Carmela, and a 12-year-old cousin, Noya, were grabbed from another house in the community. There are 203 people being held hostage in Gaza, according to the Israeli government, including civilians with passports from at least 31 other countries.Hadas\u2019s childhood friend from Nir Oz, whose relatives are also being held in Gaza, has commandeered her cellphone, shielding her from the relentless, looping horrors on social media \u2014 the celebrations of the bloodshed, the parading of humiliated captives, some stripped down to their underwear, others huddled together in what could be Hamas\u2019s vast network of tunnels. In one case, militants uploaded a video showing the killing of an elderly woman to her own Facebook page. Her granddaughter discovered it.The militants\u2019 decision to film their reign of terror has deepened the anguish of Israelis, but it has also given experts in Israel\u2019s vaunted cybersecurity and intelligence sectors a great deal of evidence to work with. They are leading a grass-roots effort now to comb through the footage and the photographs for clues about where hostages are being held.\u201cThe state has the tools and the information, but they don\u2019t have the apparatus to work as quickly as we do,\u201d said Ido Har-Tuv, a former member of Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s secretive national security service, and the chief executive of Gitam BBDO \u2014 an advertising agency that has opened a makeshift \u201cwar room\u201d out of its offices in a gleaming high-rise in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hahayal, Israel\u2019s Silicon Valley.\u201cWe\u2019re running our operation here like a lean, efficient start-up,\u201d Har-Tuv said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time.\u201dMany of the roughly 100 men and women in the \u201cwar room\u201d have deep military and intelligence experience, and some are being called up by Israel\u2019s most elite units. They include 8200, the Israeli military\u2019s cyberintelligence division, and Duvdevan, its undercover counterterrorism unit, which was the basis for the Netflix series \u201cFauda.\u201dRefael Franco, the former deputy head of the National Cyber Directorate, is overseeing the construction of the group\u2019s platform, which is based on cutting-edge AI and facial recognition technology. It is a sophisticated system that cross-checks images posted by militants posted on social media against photos of the hostages provided by families. When a match occurs, the system can geolocate \u2014 within seconds \u2014 the approximate location of a missing person. Open-source intelligence experts then try to zero in further, relying on contextual clues like mosques, local shops or the angle of the sun.The teams have already built a database of an estimated 1,000 people, including hostages and hostage takers. They are getting personnel and logistical help from Google, which has offices across town. They have shared their platform with Israeli security officials, who will use it to further their own search.Hamas took at least 64 captives into Gaza, visual evidence suggestsBut it is a time-consuming and inexact process. One of the biggest challenges, Franco said, is that hostages have been moved repeatedly.\u201cThat being said, every time someone picks up their phone and uploads footage in the strip, we can cross-check it in the system to know where they are,\u201d he said. They will keep following the digital clues, he said, for \u201cas long as this mission takes.\u201dMost of the videos were filmed and posted during or shortly after the initial abductions, flooding social media sites such as Telegram, Facebook, Snapchat and X, formerly known as Twitter \u2014 oftentimes all at once. Many were easy to find because they were posted with the same set of hashtags. In rare instances, Palestinian gunmen could be heard discussing where to take their captives.One set of videos, believed to be filmed by militants and passersby in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, showed a hostage being led by gunmen; on a wall in the background was a phone number of a local businessman, tipping off the team to the neighborhood.\u201cWe\u2019re figuring all of this out as we go,\u201d said one volunteer, among a group hunched over their laptops as they toggled through spreadsheets filled with translated posts, hashtags and geolocations.The man spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a reservist with Duvdevan. As time goes on, he said, the militants are posting less and, when they do, they are focusing more on themselves and their injuries.And as Israel expands its punishing air campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 3,700 people, hostage takers may lose electricity or cell reception and go dark entirely.Kalderon has not turned on the news since the attack. All she knows is that 80 of her 400 neighbors are dead or missing. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.She was unaware of the grass-roots efforts to locate the hostages, but she was not surprised. Across Israel, civilians have mobilized to provide aid to victims in the south and equipment to the troops, filling gaps left by the government.For a week and a half, Kalderon and her relatives heard nothing from Israeli officials about the status of their loved ones, or efforts to bring them home.On Wednesday, a military notification officer told Kalderon that her mother, Carmela \u2014 a peacenik immigrant from New York who for years helped Gazans receive medical treatment in Israel \u2014 and her autistic niece Noya \u2014 who was sleeping over at her grandmother\u2019s \u2014 were both dead. There was no information about the others.Kalderon and other relatives of hostages say have they experienced a double trauma: first left to fend for themselves when militants overran their communities, now left to navigate a deafening silence from their government.\u201cEvery second, every second, that our children are there is one second too much, and yet all Netanyahu talks about is \u2018winning the war,\u2019\u201d said Kalderon, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.He has met with only a handful of families \u2014 days after President Biden and members of his administration first reached out to them \u2014 and has provided few assurances.Kalderon, who also holds French citizenship, has met with French diplomats, including former prime minister Manuel Valls. But she is terrified that her own government, in preparing for a full-scale invasion of Gaza, may cast her children off as collateral damage.\u201cWe are simple people; we are good citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gave whatever we could to our country. It\u2019s the Israeli government that just forgot us.\u201dIsrael-Gaza war: Israel\u2019s military said it rescued two hostages from the southern Gazan city of Rafah while carrying out a wave of strikes, which Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said killed at least 67 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing political pressure to reach a hostage release deal, after rejecting a cease-fire and vowing to continue war.Middle East conflict: Tensions in the region continue to rise. As Israeli troops aim to take control of the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, officials in Cairo warn it would undermine the 1979 peace treaty. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a diplomatic scramble to avert full-scale war between Israel and Lebanon.U.S. involvement: U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria killed dozens of Iranian-linked militants, according to Iraqi officials.

    "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Hamas released two American hostages on Friday, U. S. and Israeli officials said, the first of the at least 200 captives the militant group has held since it rampaged through Israeli towns two weeks ago.The mother and daughter, released to the Red Cross in Gaza, were transferred to an Israeli military team and escorted to an army base in Israel to be reunited with their family members, officials said.\n\nThe pair, identified as Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie Raanan, of Evanston, Ill., were in Israel to visit family when they were kidnapped from Nahal Oz, a kibbutz not far from the border fence breached by Hamas fighters. The group said it released them at the request of Qatari mediators for \u201chumanitarian reasons.\u201d\n\nUntil Friday, Hamas had ignored demands from Israel and pleas from Western governments to free the captives, many of whom are children, ill or elderly. Israel has said it would not allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza through its territory until the hostages were freed. Human rights groups have said taking civilian hostages is an unambiguous war crime. President Biden has called Hamas\u2019s actions \u201cpure evil.\u201d\n\nBiden, who asked Congress on Friday to authorize a sweeping aid package for Israel, said U. S. officials and their allies were \u201cworking around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas.\u201d He pledged to continue pushing for the release of all still being held.\n\n\u201cOur fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nInside the Palestinian enclave, a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding: Nearly 2 million people have been cut off from food, water, fuel and medicine as they weather a relentless Israeli bombing campaign. Hospitals faced with dire shortages were on \u201cthe brink of collapse,\u201d the United Nations reported.\n\nBiden, who said this week that Israel and Egypt had assured him they would allow the aid trucks to pass, announced Friday that the crossing would open \u201cin the next 24 to 48 hours.\u201d\n\nElsewhere along the border, the Israeli military was massing troops and armored vehicles in preparation for the anticipated ground invasion of the densely populated territory. The operation would involve heavy urban combat and almost certainly would lead to an escalation in civilian casualties, analysts said.\n\nAs Israel prepared for a ground war, and besieged bystanders braced for its likely consequences, Amnesty International said it had found \u201cdamning evidence\u201d of Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Amnesty investigators said Israeli attacks have destroyed block after block of residential buildings and critical infrastructure and caused \u201cmass civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nFrom Egypt to Indonesia and in several American cities, demonstrators again took to the streets, shouting down Israel and its allies, especially the United States, and demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed 4,137 people in Gaza and wounded more than 13,200, Palestinian officials say. At least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli officials say. Hamas, rampaging through villages and kibbutz settlements, took more than 200 people hostage.\n\nTen Americans remained unaccounted for, Blinken said, and authorities knew that Hamas was holding at least some of them hostage. Diplomats were working feverishly to secure their release, Blinken said. He declined to share further details.\n\nThe Raanans\u2019 release spurred more urgent calls for the remaining hostages to be set free. The Hostages and Missing Families forum, a group in Israel, sought to pressure Arab leaders in the region to work to return their loved ones safely.\n\nA spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli authorities \u201cwill continue to operate with the best of their abilities and efforts in order to locate all of the missing and return all of the abductees home.\u201d"

    "description": "As Gaza prepares for what is expected to be an extensive Israeli ground invasion, the public absence of Palestinian political leadership is adding to the chaos.",
    "content": "Abbas is backed by the West but is widely unpopular across the Palestinian territories, where people are seething at the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and a year of deadly raids across the West Bank. His autocratic government is viewed by many Palestinians as an extension of the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority\u2019s \u201csilence reflects a very clear weakness,\u201d said Rula Shadeed, co-director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy. \u201cAnd also that their hands are tied. The way that they have been handling the struggle for liberation has not been fruitful in any way.\u201d\n\nAt 87 years old, Abbas is in the 18th year of a four-year term as head of the Palestinian Authority, established as an interim government by the 1993 Oslo accords. The agreements gave the authority partial sovereignty over parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which along with East Jerusalem were meant to be part of a future Palestinian state. Yet the Oslo maps no longer reflect the realities on the ground; the hope of a two-state solution has grown more remote with each passing year.\n\nIn 2007, following a disputed election in Gaza, Hamas violently ousted the Authority from the strip. Israel imposed a land and sea blockade on the tiny coastal enclave and fought four wars in Gaza in the intervening years. The fifth, which many fear will be the most deadly, was declared Sunday.\n\nThe fighting began Saturday when, under the cover of thousands of rockets fired from Gaza, hundreds of Hamas gunmen broke through Israel\u2019s high-tech border wall and terrorized towns across the south. They killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 100 hostages back to the strip.\n\nIsrael has responded with an unrelenting campaign of airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 1,000 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Gazans on Saturday to \u201cleave now,\u201d but most have nowhere to go. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of the enclave, cutting off access to power and basic supplies.\n\nAt least 179 Palestinians have been killed across the territory since January, according to the United Nations, making 2023 the deadliest year for West Bank Palestinians in two decades. There has also been a surge in violent attacks by Israeli settlers, urged on by far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\nIsraeli and Palestinian Authority security forces have struggled to contain the rise of new militant groups in Palestinian refugee camps. Some have ties to more established armed groups, including Hamas, but most are loosely organized. The majority of the fighters are young and poor. They are fed up with the occupation and disillusioned with their leaders in Ramallah.\n\nAbbas now finds himself caught in the middle, as he has been for much of his political career \u2014 criticized by Israel and the United States for not condemning militant violence, and by Palestinians for his close ties with Washington and the Authority\u2019s security cooperation with Israel.\n\nEvents in Gaza are \u201cincreasing the political weight of Hamas and decreasing the political weight and influence of the PA,\u201d said Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister of planning. \u201cBecause now is the time for fighting. And the popular parties are the parties involved in the fighting.\u201d\n\nMkheimer Abusada, one of Gaza\u2019s most respected political analysts, did not have politics on his mind when reached by phone from Gaza City. \u201cWhy are you asking about the PA?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asking about setting up a humanitarian corridor? There are 2 million people who are trapped by Israel without a safe passage.\u201d"

    "description": "The link between Egypt and Gaza is the only route for aid convoys to enter and foreign citizens to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave.",
    "content": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt\u2019s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel\u2019s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt \u2014 on the conditions they are limited to \u201cfood, water and medicine for the civilian population\u201d and do not reach Hamas."

    "description": "Humanitarian experts warned of many obstacles before Palestinians in need receive support.",
    "content": "Wrapping up a trip to Israel on Wednesday, Biden told reporters that up to 20 trucks of aid from Egypt would be allowed into the enclave through the Rafah border crossing once potholes along the road and damage from Israeli airstrikes had been repaired. Humanitarian officials warned, however, that a host of issues must still be resolved before the trucks can start moving.\n\n\u201cThe diplomats are way behind in responding to an exploding emergency,\u201d said Jan Egeland, secretary general for the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cYou now need a cease fire and you need massive access across several crossing points, even to be close to responding to the most acute needs as the entire population is now destitute.\u201d\n\nThe Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas, has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years, leaving most of its 2.3 million residents dependent on aid even before the current conflict. Those deliveries stopped entirely when Israeli and Egyptian border crossings into Gaza were closed after Hamas militants killed at least 1,400 people in a surprise assault on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7.\n\nAn initial aid delivery will ease the crisis, experts said, but only fleetingly. \u201cWhat is needed is consistent and unimpeded aid access into and within Gaza, not only for the entry of and safe passage of supplies but also for humanitarians to be able to undertake their work safely,\u201d said Emma Beals, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute who researches the distribution of aid in conflict zones.\n\n\u201cWe need more than just a promise that aid is allowed to go in,\u201d Martin Griffiths, the emergency relief coordinator who oversees humanitarian aid at the United Nations, told The Washington Post on Wednesday. \u201cAid must go in at scale and daily.\u201d U. N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres echoed that point upon arriving in Cairo early Thursday, telling reporters he is seeking agreement on \u201csustained\u201d humanitarian relief.\n\nBut U. S. officials were quick to describe the first trucks as a test balloon, with no guarantee of future deliveries if Hamas will interfere. \u201cIf Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people,\u201d Biden said, speaking aboard Air Force One as he departed Israel. \u201cAs a practical matter it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.\u201d\n\nHumanitarian officials emphasized the United Nations has established monitoring mechanisms in place for aid that crosses into Gaza. The European Union also has an assistance mission that operates at the Rafah border crossing in Egypt and could be called upon to inspect the trucks upon entry. It was unclear Thursday whether these agencies had been contacted about helping to monitor the aid route.\n\nDiscussions on inspections were still \u201congoing,\u201d U. S. and U.N. officials told The Post on Thursday. News reports in Arab media and elsewhere that a deal had been reached were \u201cpremature,\u201d one official said. Another said the talks are \u201cclose, but not there yet.\u201d Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous to hold back emergency relief for children, women and families because they fear aid diversion. Most of the stuff that goes in, the fighting men are well stocked on, they do not need bottled water or baby powder,\u201d Egeland said, adding that existing monitoring mechanisms can and should be implemented without delay.\n\nMore than 100 aid trucks were lined up Thursday in the Egyptian city of Arish, waiting for a greenlight to move to Rafah. On the other side of the border, Palestinians struggled to understand why the initial deliveries would be so small or how they would actually reach people in Gaza.\n\nMohamed Zanoon, an independent photographer who was working to document the aftermath of the Israeli air raids, said he was witnessing a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d He has struggled to push from his mind the memories of children screaming beneath the rubble. \u201cTwenty trucks is not enough,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cMore than a million people need medical care in Gaza.\u201d\n\nAmong the thorniest remaining questions is whether fuel will be allowed on the trucks. Without its regular deliveries, the last power plant in Gaza went dark last week, robbing the enclave of regular electricity. Hospitals have since struggled to keep the lights on with diesel generators. Doctors warn a total blackout would be a death sentence for patients on life support, in the operating theater and to newborns in incubators.\n\nAs news of the impending deal filtered through Gaza, residents described the aid effort as a drop in the ocean, and they fretted over whether they would receive anything all. \u201cOkay, it is something,\u201d said Yousef Hammash, a father of two from Gaza City. \u201cAt least we have it. Now we have to have a truce to distribute it. How are they going to do it under bombardment?\u201d\n\nGriffiths, from the United Nations, said humanitarian officials have been engaged in \u201cincredibly detailed negotiations\u201d about what an aid program to southern Gaza would look like. He said relief workers need assurances that they will be able to deliver aid consistently and reach people where they are \u201cin the places that they choose to be safe.\u201d\n\nFor many Palestinians, nowhere in Gaza feels safe. The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Wednesday that Israeli warplanes bombed five bakeries in different locations, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds as they lined up to buy bread. Medics and aid workers have also been killed off duty, sometimes as they left work to check on their families.\n\n\u201cThe streets are not safe, and the entire population is in need,\u201d Hammash said. \u201cEvery day we have to do our challenging mission of getting bread and water.\u201d He moved his family from Gaza City to Khan Younis this week after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of over 1 million civilians in the northern part of the enclave. But the mass displacement has put such strain on resources in the south that Hammash said some people were now heading back home. \u201cEither you get bombed in the north or you die from hunger here,\u201d he said."

Palestinians cite a series of letters in 1915 to 1916 between Mecca\u2019s emir and the British high commissioner in Egypt, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, as outlining a promise of an independent Arab state.\n\nIn 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly negotiated between Britain and France planned to carve up the Middle East into spheres of influence, and determined that the land in question was to be internationalized.\n\nIn 1917, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, expressed his government\u2019s support for \u201cthe establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\u201d in a letter to Baron Walter Rothschild, the head of the British wing of the influential European Jewish banking family.\n\nTo Israelis, the missive marks a formal utterance of the Israeli state\u2019s right to exist; to Palestinians, it was an early sign of their dispossession. The declaration also noted that it was \u201cclearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,\u201d nodding to the overwhelming majority Arab population in the region at the time. (About 90 percent of the population was Muslim in 1850, and about 80 percent in 1914.)\n\nLarge-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Both sides continued to assert their right to establish a state."

    "description": "At least 260 bodies have been recovered from the site of a trance music festival in Israel, one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their surprise attack Saturday.",
    "content": "The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re\u2019im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.\n\nAt least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.\n\nThe attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. \u201cThe event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,\u201d ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.\n\nThe festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.\n\nBen Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. \u201cI took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.\u201d\n\nThey drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.\n\nOn Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.\n\nArgamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. \u201cIf she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn\u2019t have gone, but we knew nothing,\u201d Marciano said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, \u2018Go; you\u2019re young.\u2019 I regret that.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair."

    "description": "At least 14 Americans were killed in Saturday\u2019s unprecedented attacks in Israel, while others are missing or held hostage.",
    "content": "On Tuesday, President Biden confirmed that Americans were also among the hostages taken by Hamas, but he did not specify how many. \u201cAs president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLike every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond and indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks.\u201d\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said there are 20 American citizens unaccounted for, at least some of whom are Hamas hostages. That puts the U. S. government in uncharted territory as it seeks the safe return of large numbers of its citizens from Gaza. Biden said Monday that he had directed his team members to work with their Israeli counterparts on \u201cevery aspect of the hostage crisis.\u201d\n\nAmericans killed or missing in the attacks include tourists visiting Israel; U. S. citizens serving in the Israeli army; people born in the United States who immigrated to Israel; and children born in Israel to American parents who then acquired U.S. citizenship, like Katsman. They range in age from 18 to 80. It is unclear whether any American citizens have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\nJudith Raanan, 59, and her daughter Natalie, 18, live in Evanston, Ill., and were visiting relatives at a kibbutz near Gaza. Natalie had just graduated from Deerfield High School, where she was known as a talented artist. On Saturday, Natalie\u2019s father, Uri, received a message from his daughter that said they were under attack. Then nothing, relatives said, weeping as they spoke with a reporter.\n\nAmericans were also among the revelers at an open-air trance music festival that turned into a scene of carnage. Danielle Ben-Senyor, 34, was born in Los Angeles and moved to Israel so her ailing parents could be closer to family members, said her cousin Riki Ben-Senyor. Early Saturday, Danielle, who had worked as an intensive-care nurse during the pandemic, left Tel Aviv with a group of friends to attend the music festival.\n\nGoldberg-Polin was born in California and his parents grew up in Chicago. They learned from eyewitnesses that he fled the festival in a car and sought safety in a public bomb shelter. About 30 people were in the small cement structure when they were attacked by militants, who threw grenades and fired weapons. Then they told anyone who could stand to walk outside.\n\nA witness saw Goldberg-Polin walk out, his mother said. He was missing his arm from his elbow down and had improvised a tourniquet. He was loaded onto a pickup truck with three other young men and two women. Israeli police traced the last signal from his cellphone to the border with Gaza.\n\nGoldberg addressed a news conference Tuesday along with relatives of three other missing Americans, where they urged the U. S. government to do everything in its power to find their loved ones. Jonathan Dekel-Chen\u2019s son Sagui, 35, disappeared after an attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the family lived. Dekel-Chen said he knew of at least three other American citizens from their kibbutz who were missing and two other Americans who were killed.\n\nKatsman won a prize for an academic paper he wrote about contemporary religious Zionism, the focus of his research. \u201cI really think his work helped illuminate some of the very dynamics that have brought us to this horrific moment,\u201d said Liora Halperin, a historian at the University of Washington. \u201cThere are many pieces to this puzzle, but he had devoted years of his life trying to understand some of the pieces.\u201d\n\nKatsman had a \u201cvery deep concern for all the residents of Israel and the Palestinian territories,\u201d said Devin Naar, another historian at the university who asked Katsman to be his teaching and research assistant. Katsman didn\u2019t despair but retained a kind of hope and optimism that a different future was possible, Naar said. He then stopped speaking, overcome by emotion.\n\nWacholder Katsman has not yet been able to arrange her son\u2019s funeral amid the chaos of so many deaths. But she knows one thing. He \u201cwouldn\u2019t want this conflict to be used to kill innocent people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would want this conflict to end as soon as possible.\u201d"

    "content": "Return to menu\n\nOmer Wenkert traveled to the Tribe of Nova music festival on Saturday morning, just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip. About 6:30 a.m., he called his family. The night of dancing and revelry was transforming into a massacre. Wenkert, according to his uncle Ricardo Grichner, who had a family dinner with him the night before, told relatives he could hear shooting but was unable to find a way out. In a text sent shortly before 8 a.m., he said he felt scared and helpless. Then he stopped picking up his phone.\n\nHis family wasn\u2019t sure he was alive, as reports from the scene showed Hamas militants dressed in black shooting into the crowd, overrunning the site and grabbing hostages. Survivors described gunmen blocking escape routes, ambushing those who made it out.\n\nThen, that evening, his father received a copy of a video clip shared on Telegram. The footage, which has been independently verified by The Post, showed Wenkert on the back of a white pickup truck, stripped to his underwear, with his hands tied behind his back. Around him, men dressed in military garb shoot into the air as the vehicle speeds off.\n\n\u201cThe good news was that he was alive,\u201d Grichner said, recalling the moment he saw the clip for the first time. \u201cThere are no nice words to say what you can see in the movie. \u2026 They are basically pointing a gun at Omer and beating him with several guns. You can see him trying to protect his head.\u201d\n\nA Post analysis of the footage confirmed that the video was recorded inside the Gaza Strip, about 3\u00bd miles from the site of the festival, just across the fence that separates it from southern Israel. The angles of the shadows show that the video was recorded in the morning \u2014 suggesting that the kidnappers took him into Gaza between 8 a.m. and noon on Saturday.\n\nWenkert lives with his family in the central Israeli town of Gedera, where his uncle said he works nearby as a restaurant manager. \u201cHe is a very happy guy. Very hardworking, very nice, very thoughtful,\u201d he said. The family is concerned that in captivity, he may not receive vital prescribed medication for a stomach condition.\n\n\u201cI hope the government will come to its senses,\u201d Grichner added, \u201cand somehow get Omer and all the other captives back alive.\u201d"

    "description": "Amid the horrific stories of death in southern Israel, migrant workers from Thailand and the Philippines also dodged the violence, with some still held hostage.",
    "content": "Torres looked outside and caught a glimpse of men on a motorcycle, brandishing assault rifles. One of them shot at the window, and Torres ran into the shelter for cover. Many homes in Israel bordering the Gaza Strip are equipped with safe rooms to use as shelter from incoming rockets.\n\nThe gunmen were soon battering at the door, and as they crashed through, Torres darted from the safe room, grabbed her lola from the bathroom and pulled her into the shelter, slamming the door shut. The sounds of gunshots were everywhere.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t, she would be dead,\u201d said Torres, 25. Together they waited in the reinforced shelter for 35 hours while gunshots echoed outside, a sign of the terrible slaughter being inflicted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to take it if I left my employer outside.\u201d\n\nAmid the horrific stories of Israeli communities murdered and people carried off as hostages by the Hamas attackers, the acute vulnerability of Israel\u2019s tens of thousands of migrant workers, many from Southeast Asia, has often been overlooked.\n\nAt least two Filipinos have been confirmed killed so far in southern Israel, according to the Philippine government. They worked as caregivers and died with their employers, overseas community organizers told The Washington Post. About two-thirds of the 30,000 Filipinos in Israel perform care work.\n\nAt least 21 Thai workers have been killed so far as well, and 14 others have been taken hostage, the Thai government has reported. About 30,000 Thai citizens work in Israel, overwhelmingly in the agricultural sector.\n\nThe global agricultural industry is already one of the most hazardous, failing to meet international standards on basic rights and often exploiting the vulnerability of migrant workers, labor rights advocates say. \u201cIt\u2019s exacerbated when it takes place in conflict zones,\u201d said David Welsh, Thailand country director of Solidarity Center, an international labor rights organization.\n\nThe Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it has called for the safe release of its citizens and reached out to Palestinian authorities to help facilitate this. Both the Philippines and Thailand have condemned the violence in broad terms.\n\nSurachai Seehajumpa, 40, came to Israel last year to pay off debts and save up to buy property. Work at his farm around 60 miles from Gaza carries on as usual \u2014 but he and his colleagues now can hear explosions in the distance. He regularly checks the news to see how the violence is escalating and decide whether it is time to join 5,000 other Thai nationals seeking passage home.\n\nA laborer in Israel can earn around $1,300 a month, about five times more than minimum wage in Thailand.  Surachai\u2019s farm recently took in two other Thai workers fleeing violence. For now, he and his 10 companions have no interest in returning home.\n\nProtections for migrant workers depend on their contracts, relationships with employers and government schemes, said Filipino social worker and volunteer Agnes Hoffman, who has lived in Israel for 26 years. The ongoing conflict highlights the urgency of a longtime proposal from community leaders for the Philippine government to support a permanent shelter for temporary workers, she added.\n\n\u201cThere are always Filipinos who take in other Filipinos \u2026 but those aren\u2019t their permanent homes,\u201d said Hoffman, who also urged authorities to provide for psychological aid to shellshocked workers in their first language.\n\nSally Macadini, a 38-year-old Filipino caregiver, also managed to get her elderly employer into the safe room just as the attack happened. On the chat group she maintained with fellow caregivers, she found out that a colleague a few houses away had been unable save her employer, who was shot dead.\n\nShe watched the news on the television in the safe room, relaying updates to her fellow caregivers via chat. Many hours later, there was a banging on the door, but she and her employer stayed silent until she was informed on the group chat that the Israeli army had arrived.\n\nAs for whether she would leave Israel, she is still undecided. She said she felt an obligation both to the family she worked for in Israel, and her family relying on her support at home. \u201cWe\u2019re in doubt knowing how hard life in the Philippines is,\u201d Macadini said. \u201cIf we go home, how do we make a living?\u201d"

    "description": "As Gazans flee, Israel\u2019s military leadership readies a broad offensive. But experts in urban warfare warn that the terrain is troublesome and the endgame uncertain.",
    "content": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that \u201cevery Hamas fighter\u201d will be \u201cdestroyed,\u201d while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to go back in, heavy, and it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,\u201d said Kenneth \u201cFrank\u201d McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be \u201cdragged out over a much longer period of time\u201d than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities \u2014 including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people \u2014 have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would \u201cend\u201d the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an \u201cintegrated and coordinated attack\u201d by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel\u2019s offensive is \u201cobviously going to be much larger\u201d now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be \u201cexponentially greater\u201d than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in \u201cdog fights\u201d between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has \u201cbecome very efficient\u201d at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces\u2019 advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas\u2019s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn\u2019t sustainable.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to go into Gaza again. They didn\u2019t want to occupy it. They didn\u2019t want to be responsible for administrating it,\u201d Misztal said. \u201cBut now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?\u201d\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel \u201cat this time\u201d \u2014 but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power."

    "description": "The families of more than 100 Israelis thought be held captive inside Gaza are growing ever more desperate for information as full-scale war looms.",
    "content": "The scene is being re-created across the country, as the families of more than 100 Israelis thought to be held captive inside of Gaza grow ever more desperate for information. In the absence of a government response, they are dreading the one most likely: a massive military operation, which they fear could put their loved ones in the firing line.\n\nSome families have already had their worst fears confirmed. Videos reviewed Monday by The Washington Post showed evidence that at least four people in the town of Be\u2019eri were killed soon after being taken captive by Hamas.\n\nBut none of the previous episodes, experts say, compares with the mass kidnapping of children, grandparents and whole families, much of it captured on video and shared on social media. And none of the options the government may be considering are likely to end without more bloodshed, they said.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented. We\u2019ve never had so many people taken and held in a hostile territory,\u201d said Gershon Baskin, Israel\u2019s back-channel negotiator in the Shalit case. \u201cIt\u2019s a new reality, and it\u2019s difficult to measure how society will respond to this.\u201d\n\nHamas has said the hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations. Ahmed Abdul Hadi, Hamas\u2019s representative in Lebanon, denied reports that the group was in talks with Qatar over a prisoner exchange: \u201cThere is nothing like that right now at all,\u201d he told The Post on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for this conversation.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s intelligence in Gaza was thought to be effective until Saturday\u2019s surprise attack, but even before that, Hamas had proved its determination to conceal hostages. On the day Shalit was released, the militants sent out more than 30 decoy vehicles, Baskin said. The captive wasn\u2019t in any of them.\n\nThe multipronged attack, in which at least 800 people were killed, shattered Israel\u2019s shaky but enduring coexistence with Hamas. The regular rocket launches and periodic wars were largely deemed an acceptable price for otherwise containing the militant group. Now the country appears unified in calling for a major military intervention, whatever the costs.\n\n\u201cI think the Israeli public, from the far left to the far right, feels that the price of coexistence with Hamas is intolerable,\u201d Orbach said.\n\nBoth experts thought a small-scale hostage deal was possible \u2014 the exchange of children, elderly and sick Israelis for female and ill Hamas prisoners, for example. But neither thought the hostages would keep Israel from launching an overwhelming attack on Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe public wants to go into Gaza and attack Hamas,\u201d Orbach said. \u201cThe public also wants the hostages to be safely rescued. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve come to terms with the inherent contradiction.\u201d\n\nYaffa Adar, a resident of Nir-Oz, a kibbutz just miles from the Gaza border, last made contact from her basement at 9 a.m. Saturday, the day the family had plans to gather for the Sukkot holiday: \u201cThere are terrorists in the road,\u201d she texted them."

    "description": "Tensions over bloodshed in the Middle East have Palestinian Americans increasingly anxious about the violence they may face here.",
    "content": "The Palestinian boy who had been knifed to death on Saturday was 6 \u2014 the same age as her son \u2014 so Fidaa Elaydi imposed a new rule: No more playing outside. She used to feel safe in Bridgeview, a Chicago suburb full of Middle Eastern eateries and Muslim clothing boutiques that was known as Little Palestine. Then the Palestinian militant group Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history.\n\nIn the 10 days since the rampage by Hamas fighters and Israel\u2019s full-scale counterstrike targeting the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, a spate of headlines has validated her fears. In Boston, somebody spray-painted \u201cNazis\u201d on a sign for a Palestinian cultural center. In Dearborn, Mich., police arrested a man who allegedly urged his Facebook friends to \u201chunt Palestinians.\u201d And barely 25 miles from Elaydi\u2019s house, a landlord is accused of stabbing his tenants, gravely wounding the mother and killing her son, with authorities linking his assault \u201cto them being Muslims and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.\u201d\n\nPalestinians in the United States, half a world away from the carnage in the Middle East, say they are canceling dinners out, taking time off work and staying home. Some are getting ominous emails and messages on social media. Others say the environment seems so charged, they\u2019re afraid to openly express concern for loved ones trapped in Gaza as Israel pushes to eradicate the militants responsible for the Oct. 7 massacre of soldiers and civilians.\n\nAnguish for family members in Gaza only heightened the anxiety after a strike Tuesday set a hospital ablaze. Palestinian and Israeli officials traded blame for the attack. The only certainty: Hundreds may have been killed, adding to the death toll of about 3,000 Palestinians.\n\nThose who argue for a Palestinian state, a decades-old cause, say they are being framed as cheerleading \u201cHamas\u2019s genocidal war,\u201d as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) phrased it in a letter to the Justice Department. Hawley called for an investigation of student groups organizing pro-Palestinian rallies.\n\nThe bloodshed overseas is sowing panic in communities across the country, with the FBI saying it is tracking a spike in threats against both Muslim and Jewish Americans. The agency warned that bad actors could \u201cexploit the conflict\u201d and provoke violence \u201con our own soil.\u201d Mosques and synagogues have beefed up security. Some private Jewish day schools shuttered last week after a former Hamas leader called for a \u201cday of jihad.\u201d\n\nHundreds of Arab Americans gathered at a mosque in Bridgeview on Monday for the funeral of the 6-year-old boy, Wadea Alfayoumi, who had been stabbed 26 times, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Outside, speakers called on lawmakers to address the conflict with context and nuance. Some demanded an apology from President Biden, whom they accused of inflaming tensions with his comment about seeing photos of Hamas fighters beheading children \u2014 a claim the White House later walked back.\n\nOne attended a pro-Palestinian rally on campus last week where strangers started filming the students, Othman said, and she advised her to not engage with anyone who seemed hostile. She doesn\u2019t want her daughters to limit their freedom of speech, though.\n\nRanda Mohammad, a student-support coordinator at a middle school in Dearborn, is following the news with a growing sense of dread. Five of her relatives \u2014 her sister-in-law\u2019s cousins \u2014 were killed in Gaza while trying to help civilians who had been ordered to evacuate, she said. When videos of the hospital attack reached her phone, she hid in the garage so her children wouldn\u2019t see her cry.\n\nMore than half of Dearborn\u2019s residents are Arab American. Familial ties to Gaza and the West Bank run deep. People love to snack on flaky, cheese-layered kunafa at the beloved Palestinian bakery. And, Mohammad said, everyone is on edge.\n\nThe police presence outside her school has been heavier than normal, she noted; officers arrested a 41-year-old man last week who had posted on social media about hunting Palestinians. On Monday, a 12-year-old student came to her with a question.\n\nThe Arab American Political Action Committee canceled a banquet scheduled for Wednesday in Dearborn, accusing American leaders of endorsing bloodshed by not \u201cdoing the bare minimum of calling for a cease fire.\u201d The organizers also harbored security concerns, according to Osama Siblani, a Lebanese journalist on the board of directors. Palestinians as a group, he said, are too often portrayed as the enemy."

It did not explicitly denounce Hamas.\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom recalls its repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities,\u201d the statement read."

    "content": "\u201cThe United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during the conflict. And I grieve. I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy,\u201d Biden said. Earlier in the day, the president said his assessment of responsibility was based on data shown to him by the U. S. Defense Department.\n\nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the U. S. government assessment was based on \u201cavailable reporting, including intelligence, missile activity, overhead imagery, and open source video and images of the incident.\u201d The intelligence, she said, indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion was caused by a rocket or missile launched by a militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. She said U.S. officials are working to corroborate whether that is the case.\n\nSince the hospital was devastated Tuesday by a strike that Palestinian authorities said killed hundreds of people, Israel and the United States have been the targets of rage, condemnation and protest that have surged across the Middle East. Wednesday\u2019s statements by Israel and the United States that a Palestinian militant group was responsible for the blast may carry little weight with Arab protesters.\n\nAmong the most useful pieces of information in identifying who may be responsible for a strike are infrared signatures from satellites, which may have detected a rocket launch as opposed to an aerial bombing, one U. S. official said. Images of the impact site, as well as any fragments recovered, could also help identify who was responsible, the official said.\n\nThe U. S. conclusion appeared to do little to assuage anger in Arab and Muslim countries, where people generally harbor deep distrust of Israel and the United States. Israel\u2019s army in the past has blamed Palestinian militants for strikes and civilian deaths and then later acknowledged it was probably at fault, such as in the death of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.\n\nIn Amman, Jordan, Biden had been scheduled to meet with the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to discuss the conflict and the need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. The White House said Biden would continue to be in touch with those leaders, but the meeting\u2019s cancellation was a setback to the president\u2019s diplomatic efforts.\n\n\u201cFor the people of Israel, there\u2019s only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel, and that is having you standing in Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cYour visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war, and it is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel.\u201d"

    "description": "Mounting Middle Eastern anger overshadowed President Biden\u2019s visit to Israel, at least temporarily disrupting U.S. efforts to de-escalate regional tensions.",
    "content": "Biden announced that a deal had been struck with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to flow from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million people face relentless airstrikes and an Israeli siege. Supplies of food, drinking water and fuel are dwindling by the hour. Despite the apparent breakthrough, Biden said the aid would not start arriving until Friday at the earliest.\n\nConcerned that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a broader regional conflict, the White House has tried to assure Arab partners that it will use its influence to protect innocent Gazans. Conditions in the enclave \u2014 already one of the poorest and most densely populated places in the world \u2014 are deteriorating rapidly. More than 3,000 people have been killed by airstrikes. Local hospitals are collapsing.\n\nBiden spent a little over seven hours in Israel, where he was greeted on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two men \u2014 whose decades-long relationship has been tested this year \u2014 shared a brief hug. Biden spent more than two hours at a meeting of the Israeli war cabinet before speaking with survivors of the attacks and families of victims and hostages.\n\nNetanyahu emphasized Wednesday that Israel would not permit the transfer of any humanitarian aid to Gaza from its own territory, but said it would not thwart the delivery of supplies from Egypt, provided it was limited to \u201cfood, water and medicine for the civilian population\u201d \u2014 and so long as none of it reached Hamas.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday called on residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the town of al-Mawasi, the latest in a series of recent directives urging Gazans to move south, even though most have nowhere to stay. The United Nations has warned that the evacuation orders may violate international law.\n\nThere was little acknowledgment in the region of Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility for the hospital strike, or of Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalizing ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d"

    "content": "But any sense of public comity between Washington and its Arab partners was shattered Tuesday as gruesome images emerged at the site of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian authorities say an Israeli airstrike killed up to 500 people in the attack. Israel denies the charge, saying the facility was blown up by errant rocket fire from an Islamist militant group. The White House, citing preliminary U. S. intelligence, has sided with Israel.\n\nThe hospital blast has \u201cderailed a much-needed opportunity to make meaningful progress on the near-term solution to the Gaza crisis,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAnd by inflaming opinion across the Arab world, it has heightened prospects for escalation and a much more dangerous and protracted conflict in the region.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what made him think that, Biden cited the \u201cdata I was shown by my Defense Department,\u201d without elaborating. The National Security Council later issued a statement attributing the U. S. intelligence assessment to \u201coverhead imagery, intercepts and open source information,\u201d though so far it has not publicly disclosed any of those materials.\n\nThe United States switched, for instance, its policy seeking safe passage for Palestinian civilians through Egypt in response to meetings with Abbas and Sisi, who opposed the proposal out of fear that fleeing Palestinians may never be able to return to Gaza.\n\nThat led up to what Biden announced on Wednesday: an agreement with Israel to allow the delivery of aid on the condition that there will be inspections and that the aid won\u2019t go to Hamas. \u201cIsrael agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut a critical player on aid delivery is Egypt, which controls part of the Rafah border crossing, and Hamas, which controls the other half. That is why Arab leaders, who have communication links with Hamas and other key players on the ground, were viewed as a critical part of Biden\u2019s trip."

    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility, or Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201chitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel\u2019s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.\u201d Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached \u2014 or were considering \u2014 deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. \u201cWhere is the Arab army?\u201d university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to \u201cend all forms of normalization and cooperation\u201d with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n\u201cOf course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,\u201d he added. For that to change, \u201cthe Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn\u2019t them, and I don\u2019t think they can do that.\u201d\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments \u2014 such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 \u2014 indicated Israel\u2019s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the \u201cIsrael attack\u201d on the hospital and called for an \u201cimmediate cease-fire\u201d \u2014 a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man \u2014 apparently involved in the aid effort \u2014 yells at the camera: \u201cIf there is bombing, I\u2019ll go in. If there is death, I\u2019ll go in. I came here determined to go in.\u201d\n\nAn accumulation of grievances \u2014 over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel\u2019s hard-right government \u2014 seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza \u2014 barred by Israel and Egypt \u2014 Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, \u201cin real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,\u201d she said."

    "description": "The secretary of state appealed to the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Egypt to tamp down anger over Israel\u2019s retaliation and to assist in humanitarian aid",
    "content": "\u201cI heard a lot of good ideas about some of the things we need to do moving forward,\u201d Blinken told reporters on Sunday following his meetings with the two leaders. But differences of views emerged immediately on Israel\u2019s right to wage a massive offensive in Gaza, which both Sisi and Mohammed raised concerns about.\n\nThe top U. S. diplomat is hopscotching the Middle East with the goal of convincing Arab partners to condemn Hamas\u2019s horrific assault in Israel and refrain from stoking domestic unrest in response to Israel\u2019s devastating bombing campaign in Gaza. The violence has resulted in the death of more than 1,300 Israelis and more than 2,600 Palestinians.\n\nOn Saturday, U. S. officials announced that they had reached an agreement with Cairo for a temporary opening at the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt for U.S. citizens seeking to flee the violence and Israeli bombardment. The announcement resulted in scores of the estimated 500- to 600 Palestinian Americans in Gaza rushing to the border, but none have been able to cross into Egypt amid contradictory remarks between U.S. and Egyptian officials about why the border won\u2019t reopen.\n\nThe Rafah border crossing \u2014 the only egress that Israel does not control \u2014 has also remained closed to critical supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine that aid groups and friendly nations, with Egypt\u2019s coordination, are trying to send into Gaza. Israeli airstrikes damaged the crossing last week, and Israel was unwilling to commit to not striking aid vehicles that enter Gaza, a diplomatic official told The Post Saturday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\n\u201cEgypt has put in place a lot of material support for people in Gaza, and Rafah will be opened,\u201d Blinken said about his discussions with Sisi on the border. \u201cWe\u2019re putting in place with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel, with others, the mechanism by which to get the assistance in, and to get it to people who need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that you are a Jewish person and I am an Egyptian person who grew up next to Jews in Egypt,\u201d Sisi said. \u201cThey have never been subjected to any form of oppression or targeting and it has never happened in our region that Jews were targeted in recent or old history.\u201d\n\nSisi, an authoritarian leader, has harshly cracked down on Islamists in Egypt. Still, Christian churches and religious leaders have frequently come under attack by Islamist extremists \u2014 and there are only a handful of Egyptian Jews left in the country. Tens of thousands of Jews left Egypt under pressure from the government of Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nWhile Sisi denounced Hamas\u2019s assault on Israelis, he blamed Israel for driving Palestinians to desperation given the lack of progress toward a two-state solution. After Sisi met with his national security council earlier Sunday, his office put out a statement calling for an international summit \u201cto study the future of the Palestinian cause.\u201d Blinken told reporters he supported the idea but \u201cwe have to get through this crisis first.\u201d\n\nAs the only country that maintains strong communications with Israel, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, Egypt has been a key interlocutor during past flare-ups of violence. Cairo brokered the cease-fire in May 2021 that ended an 11-day outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas that left more than 250 people dead.\n\nThat influence is a cornerstone of arguments in Cairo and in Washington for the continued provision of $1.3 billion in U. S. military aid to Egypt annually, despite the Sisi government\u2019s abysmal human rights record. When Biden first came to office in 2021, pledging to put human rights at the center of his foreign policy, the bilateral relationship took a frostier turn. But when Egypt stepped in to mediate a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in May of that year, Biden phoned him twice in one week.\n\nThe Egyptian public is staunchly supportive of the Palestinian cause, and Egypt has pushed for a two-state solution to the long-simmering conflict. But Cairo, supremely concerned with internal security, has also played a role in enforcing Israel\u2019s 16-year blockade of Gaza \u2014 particularly after Sisi took power in a military coup in 2013. In the early years of his presidency, Sisi was focused on stamping out the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and saw Hamas, with its Islamist orientation, as an ally of the Brotherhood, Elgindy said. The Israel-Gaza war in 2014 lasted for weeks in part because Cairo was \u201cdragging its feet\u201d to punish Hamas, he added.\n\nAs Israel continues to bombard Gaza, and pro-Palestinian protests around the world showcase the anger of the Arab street, Egypt has sought to be a voice of calm, calling on all parties to de-escalate and to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy, phoning world leaders and hosting top diplomats from countries including Turkey, Germany and Italy in Cairo to convey this message."

    "description": "Scenes of carnage from Gaza have deepened resentment of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and increased local support for Hamas, its longtime rival.",
    "content": "Over the same period, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 60 Palestinians in the West Bank and injured more than 1,300, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has also locked down parts of the West Bank, closing roads and putting up checkpoints to prevent Palestinians from moving between towns and cities.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in 1967. Under the Oslo accords, brokered by President Bill Clinton in 1993, those territories were meant to form a Palestinian state. But the U. S.-led peace process has been dormant for years. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded. Members of Israel\u2019s current government, the most far-right in its history, have called openly for annexation.\n\nSince 2007, when Hamas violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip, Abbas has cracked down on supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza, as well as on his own critics. Long-promised elections have never been held. Despair has deepened in the impoverished refugee camps that still dot the West Bank.\n\nOver the past two years, camps in Nablus, Jenin and elsewhere have become incubators for a new generation of armed groups that have carried out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians. Israel has responded with massive military raids across the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians here since the end of the second intifada in 2005.\n\n\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d said the 38-year-old militant, a father of three, speaking on the condition that he be identified by his childhood nickname to protect his security. Zoufi said he awoke on Oct. 7 to the news of Hamas\u2019s rampage and asked his wife to slap him to make sure he wasn\u2019t dreaming. Then he laughed with joy.\n\nZoufi is affiliated with Fatah but opposes the Palestinian Authority\u2019s nonviolent approach. He founded his militant cell last year. Balata is home to some 30,000 people and has no proper police force. The same is true in other camps in Nablus and Jenin and throughout the northern West Bank. In these communities, the militants are the ones in charge.\n\n\u201cIf Israel will do a stupid thing like the ground invasion, war will break out not only in the West Bank and inside Israel but also around the Arab world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want liberation, not bloodshed. ... I hope it will stop before it comes to that.\u201d\n\nMohamed Hamdan, the secretary general of Fatah in Nablus, defended Abbas and his efforts to revive peace negotiations. He said the authority was doing its best to maintain order and rein in weapons on the street. But the international community had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Palestinians, he said."

    "description": "The strike on the hospital came as President Biden was set to visit the region and humanitarian aid for Gaza remained stranded on the Egyptian border.",
    "content": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden\u2019s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country\u2019s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza\u2019s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n\u201cWe all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,\u201d Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. \u201cThey go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?\u201d\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid."

    "description": "Americans have been unable to cross into Egypt from Gaza after the Rafah crossing remained closed Saturday despite a U.S. deal to open it for several hours.",
    "content": "Before dawn on Saturday, Abood Okal and his family received the news they had desperately been waiting for. Okal and his wife and their 1-year-old son were finally offered a possible way out of Gaza \u2014 and back to their home near Boston. An email from the U.S. State Department told them the sole border crossing with Egypt \u201cmay be open\u201d for a five-hour window later that day, from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Okal and his family went to the Rafah crossing only to find it closed. There were no officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing except for a few plainclothes security guards whose job was to keep people from getting too close to the gate, Okal said.\n\nThe U. S. government had negotiated a deal to allow American citizens to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt during the five-hour window, U.S. officials said Saturday. But Palestinian and Egyptian officials failed to communicate about opening it, an official at the border said. By the end of the day, no one had been able to cross.\n\nWael Abu Omar, the Palestinian spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said Palestinian officials had not had any communication with their counterparts on the Egyptian side. Egyptian media outlets reported that Cairo would only allow foreigners to cross the border if aid shipments could be delivered to Gaza.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has said it would strike any trucks coming across the border, especially trucks carrying fuel, according to a diplomatic official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nOfficials are discussing the possibility of setting up a screening mechanism that would allow the Israelis to inspect goods in each vehicle entering Gaza, the diplomat said. Another official familiar with the talks over the aid deliveries said any agreement would require \u201cIsrael to stop bombing the enclave for a few hours.\u201d\n\nThe confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Rafah crossing comes as hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in response to an evacuation order from Israel\u2019s military, ahead of a possible ground invasion into the besieged enclave.\n\n\u201cWe have informed U. S. citizens in Gaza with whom we are in contact that if they assess it to be safe, they may wish to move closer to the Rafah border crossing,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that \u201cthere may be very little notice if the crossing opens and it may only open for a limited time.\u201d\n\nU. S. officials have spent the past several days trying to evacuate all U.S. staff in Gaza, a group of about 15 Palestinians that includes three U.S. government employees who work for USAID in Gaza, along with their immediate family members, according to a diplomatic official familiar with the situation.\n\nEach time, they\u2019ve been stopped at checkpoints near the border inside Gaza and have been unable to leave. In some cases at these checkpoints, the diplomatic official said, people identifying themselves as Hamas have said none of them will be able to leave until aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip.\n\nCanadian officials also told citizens on Friday that the Rafah crossing might open Saturday for a five-hour window to allow Canadians to exit. Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly told reporters Saturday that the \u201clatest information\u201d she had was that \u201cviolence\u201d in the area forced authorities to cancel the operation. She did not elaborate.\n\nOn Friday, Okal and his extended family had rushed south from  Jabalya in the north of Gaza after the Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate. They scrambled frantically to find cars to fit them all and a place to stay near the crossing.\n\nOkal, 36, and his family spent hours waiting under the hot sun Saturday. He said there were several hundred people there, including another American family from New Jersey. He said there were other foreign nationals too, including Canadians, Swedes, Spaniards and Norwegians.\n\nAs the day dragged on, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, took their exhausted toddler, Yousef, back to the home where they are staying with 30 other people, a short drive away. Food vendors near the crossing warned Okal that it was not safe to stay once the sun set. Still, he remained there until nearly 6 p.m., he said, hoping something might change. When he began to hear the sound of fighter planes and drones, he knew he had to leave the area."

    "description": "The link between Egypt and Gaza is the only route for aid convoys to enter and foreign citizens to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave.",
    "content": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt\u2019s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel\u2019s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt \u2014 on the conditions they are limited to \u201cfood, water and medicine for the civilian population\u201d and do not reach Hamas."

    "description": "As President Biden visits Israel Wednesday, here\u2019s a tour through the history of presidential visits to war zones\u2014some of them covert, rash and even life-threatening.",
    "content": "An earlier version of the above caption incorrectly said that President Abraham Lincoln was visiting Antietam, Md. He was at the Antietam battlefield in Maryland. The caption has been corrected. President Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday as the Israeli military ramps up its response to the Hamas attack. It will be Biden\u2019s second visit as president to an active war zone not under U.S. military control; he visited Ukraine in February.As commander in chief of the U.S. military, presidents have always had a role to fill in wartime. And many, from the first president, have had military experience. But only a handful have made trips to active war zones while in office. Here are some historical highlights.\n\nWhile Abraham Lincoln is sometimes described as the first president to come under enemy fire in an active war zone, it was actually James Madison during the War of 1812, according to Michael Beschloss, author of \u201cPresidents of War.\u201d On Aug. 24, 1814, Madison traveled from the White House to the Battle of Bladensburg a few miles east, brandishing two pistols and a spyglass. Though it is extremely unlikely the British knew Madison was there, he nonetheless came under enemy fire.\n\nOnce it was clear that the British were going to win the battle and invade the capital, Madison high-tailed it back through Washington and over the Potomac River to Virginia. The British set the Capitol and the White House on fire, but their sacking of the city was interrupted by a sudden hurricane-strength storm, prompting a hasty retreat. Madison returned to Washington a week later, on Sept. 1.\n\nLincoln made numerous battlefield visits during the Civil War, though the only time he ventured close enough to come under enemy fire was during his visit to Fort Stevens, on the northern side of the District of Columbia, on July 12, 1864. The tall, lanky, top-hatted president cut a recognizable profile from a distance, and Confederate soldiers soon began shooting at him, prompting a Union soldier to request that Lincoln kindly leave; he is often said, apocryphally, to have shouted, \u201cGet down, you damn fool!\u201d\n\nFort Stevens Park, where the fort once stood, is in D. C.\u2019s Brightwood neighborhood, and there\u2019s a small cemetery a few blocks away for Union soldiers killed in the Battle of Fort Stevens.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt became the first president to fly on an airplane during his secret 1943 trip to North Africa as World War II raged. While the media thought he was vacationing at his home in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, Roosevelt traveled by train to Miami, where he took a plane to Trinidad and Tobago, then to Brazil and Gambia before finally landing in Casablanca, Morocco, five days later. There, he attended strategy meetings with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and French commander Charles de Gaulle, before surprising U. S. military members with a drive-by review. A United Press International correspondent later wrote that as the president\u2019s Jeep slowly passed by, the surprise at his presence left soldiers\u2019 \u201cfaces wreathed in smiles.\u201d\n\nIn October 1966, as American support for the war in Vietnam began to wane, Lyndon B. Johnson made a surprise visit to U. S. forces at Cam Ranh Bay. Like Lincoln, Johnson was a tall guy and made himself a pretty easy target by getting close to the action, according to Beschloss, even standing up in a Jeep to address the troops. Unlike Lincoln, he did not come under fire. Johnson made a second visit to Cam Ranh Bay the next year.\n\nEvery president since Johnson has visited U. S. troops posted in conflict zones overseas. Richard M. Nixon also went to Vietnam; Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump all visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea; both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush served Thanksgiving turkeys to troops in Iraq during their presidencies; Bill Clinton visited Bosnia; and Barack Obama spent time with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nVisits to U. S. troops overseas are nothing new for Biden, who went on such trips as vice president and as a senator on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhat is new is that the U. S. military is not actively engaged in the conflict zones Biden is visiting this year. His February visit to Ukraine and now his visit to Israel are both without precedent in modern presidential history."

    "description": "Josh Paul\u2019s departure from the State Department is a rare measure of internal dissent over the Biden administration\u2019s robust support for Israel.",
    "content": "A State Department official who worked on arms transfers to foreign powers resigned Wednesday over the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, declaring he could not support further U. S. military assistance to Israel and calling the administration\u2019s response \u201can impulsive reaction\u201d based on \u201cintellectual bankruptcy.\u201dSign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.The official, Josh Paul, was director of congressional and public affairs at the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which handles arms transfers. His departure marks a rare measure of internal discomfort over the administration\u2019s robust support for Israel, the United States\u2019 closest ally in the Middle East. More broadly, it was an unusual public show of dissent within President Biden\u2019s foreign policy apparatus, which has worked to prevent such expressions of frustration from spilling over into view.\n\nPaul had spent more than 11 years in his role, which coordinates relations with Congress and public messaging for a key office that deals with military aid. He said that he could not countenance continuing in a job that he said was contributing to the deaths of Palestinian civilians.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s absolutely note the horror of what Hamas did, and the scale of it. And therefore I fear the scale of the potential Israeli response or ongoing Israeli response,\u201d Paul said in an interview. \u201cI recognize the Israeli government\u2019s right to respond and to defend themselves. I guess I question how many Palestinian children have to die in that process.\u201d\n\nPaul said the robust U. S. military assistance for Israel was effectively giving the country a green light to do what it wants against Gaza, regardless of the civilian toll. The Israeli government has declared that it plans to destroy Hamas and has told the residents of Gaza City and northern Gaza to move southward, a request U.N. observers have declared will create a humanitarian disaster.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has spent the past week hopscotching the Middle East in a bid to create regional support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself and avoid a regional war, but also to push Israel to respect humanitarian concerns in Gaza.\n\nBiden, visiting Israel on Wednesday, declared that the United States is \u201cgoing to stand with you.\u201d But he urged Israelis to draw a distinction between Palestinians and Hamas, and to minimize civilian casualties.\n\nPaul said that he had encountered other dilemmas while working on military assistance inside the State Department, but that he had always felt he could \u201cbend things in the right direction.\u201d Not so this time, which was the biggest reason he resigned, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no questioning on this one. There\u2019s no space for substantive dissent within the system on this one. And that\u2019s what led me to my decision,\u201d he said. He said there wasn\u2019t a single precipitating moment that led to his resignation Wednesday, simply the feeling of being party to a slew of decisions that he disagreed with and felt powerless to influence.\n\nAlthough State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs also has had a major role in arms transfers to Ukraine after Russia invaded last year, Paul\u2019s academic background and career has long intertwined with Israel and the Palestinian territories. He wrote his master\u2019s thesis about Israeli counterterrorism and civil rights, he said, and worked in Ramallah, in the West Bank, on security sector governance with the Palestinian Authority. And, in his resignation letter, he said he had \u201cdeep personal ties to both sides of the conflict.\u201d\n\nPaul said he spent last week on a preplanned leave, giving him more space to watch what was happening from the outside and to contemplate his decision. Since he publicly announced his resignation in a two-page declaration posted on LinkedIn, he said he had received many expressions of support from State Department colleagues."

    "description": "President Biden\u2019s trip is a dramatic display of support for Israel as fighting continues to rage.",
    "content": "\u201cThe United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during the conflict. And I grieve. I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy,\u201d Biden said. Earlier in the day, the president said his assessment of responsibility was based on data shown to him by the U. S. Defense Department.\n\nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the U. S. government assessment was based on \u201cavailable reporting, including intelligence, missile activity, overhead imagery, and open source video and images of the incident.\u201d The intelligence, she said, indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion was caused by a rocket or missile launched by a militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. She said U.S. officials are working to corroborate whether that is the case.\n\nSince the hospital was devastated Tuesday by a strike that Palestinian authorities said killed hundreds of people, Israel and the United States have been the targets of rage, condemnation and protest that have surged across the Middle East. Wednesday\u2019s statements by Israel and the United States that a Palestinian militant group was responsible for the blast may carry little weight with Arab protesters.\n\nAmong the most useful pieces of information in identifying who may be responsible for a strike are infrared signatures from satellites, which may have detected a rocket launch as opposed to an aerial bombing, one U. S. official said. Images of the impact site, as well as any fragments recovered, could also help identify who was responsible, the official said.\n\nThe U. S. conclusion appeared to do little to assuage anger in Arab and Muslim countries, where people generally harbor deep distrust of Israel and the United States. Israel\u2019s army in the past has blamed Palestinian militants for strikes and civilian deaths and then later acknowledged it was probably at fault, such as in the death of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.\n\nIn Amman, Jordan, Biden had been scheduled to meet with the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to discuss the conflict and the need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. The White House said Biden would continue to be in touch with those leaders, but the meeting\u2019s cancellation was a setback to the president\u2019s diplomatic efforts.\n\n\u201cFor the people of Israel, there\u2019s only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel, and that is having you standing in Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cYour visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war, and it is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel.\u201d"

    "content": "Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday\u2019s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.\n\nPalestinian teams combed Wednesday through the blast zone \u2014 an area that radiated from a crater punched into pavement just outside the four-story complex. Cars were flipped over by the force of the explosion. Other vehicles were charred. The blast bent metal fencing and shattered windows.\n\nGaza\u2019s Health Ministry said 471 people were killed and more than 300 were injured, with 28 of the injured in critical condition. The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\u201cBecause of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,\u201d said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel\u2019s military said that part of a \u201cbarrage of rockets\u201d fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden\u2019s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.\n\nHundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City\u2019s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.\n\nVideo verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion \u2014 a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.\n\nHospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.\n\nMore than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died \u2014 many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion \u2014 and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.\n\nRegional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan\u2019s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war \u201chas entered a dangerous phase,\u201d and \u201cwill plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,\u201d according to a palace statement.\n\nBiden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack."

    "description": "Scenes of carnage from Gaza have deepened resentment of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and increased local support for Hamas, its longtime rival.",
    "content": "Over the same period, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 60 Palestinians in the West Bank and injured more than 1,300, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has also locked down parts of the West Bank, closing roads and putting up checkpoints to prevent Palestinians from moving between towns and cities.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in 1967. Under the Oslo accords, brokered by President Bill Clinton in 1993, those territories were meant to form a Palestinian state. But the U. S.-led peace process has been dormant for years. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded. Members of Israel\u2019s current government, the most far-right in its history, have called openly for annexation.\n\nSince 2007, when Hamas violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip, Abbas has cracked down on supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza, as well as on his own critics. Long-promised elections have never been held. Despair has deepened in the impoverished refugee camps that still dot the West Bank.\n\nOver the past two years, camps in Nablus, Jenin and elsewhere have become incubators for a new generation of armed groups that have carried out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians. Israel has responded with massive military raids across the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians here since the end of the second intifada in 2005.\n\n\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d said the 38-year-old militant, a father of three, speaking on the condition that he be identified by his childhood nickname to protect his security. Zoufi said he awoke on Oct. 7 to the news of Hamas\u2019s rampage and asked his wife to slap him to make sure he wasn\u2019t dreaming. Then he laughed with joy.\n\nZoufi is affiliated with Fatah but opposes the Palestinian Authority\u2019s nonviolent approach. He founded his militant cell last year. Balata is home to some 30,000 people and has no proper police force. The same is true in other camps in Nablus and Jenin and throughout the northern West Bank. In these communities, the militants are the ones in charge.\n\n\u201cIf Israel will do a stupid thing like the ground invasion, war will break out not only in the West Bank and inside Israel but also around the Arab world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want liberation, not bloodshed. ... I hope it will stop before it comes to that.\u201d\n\nMohamed Hamdan, the secretary general of Fatah in Nablus, defended Abbas and his efforts to revive peace negotiations. He said the authority was doing its best to maintain order and rein in weapons on the street. But the international community had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Palestinians, he said."

    "description": "Protesters from Morocco to Iran condemned Israel and the United States for a deadly hospital attack \u2014 dismissing Israeli statements blaming Palestinian militants.",
    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility, or Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201chitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel\u2019s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.\u201d Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached \u2014 or were considering \u2014 deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. \u201cWhere is the Arab army?\u201d university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to \u201cend all forms of normalization and cooperation\u201d with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n\u201cOf course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,\u201d he added. For that to change, \u201cthe Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn\u2019t them, and I don\u2019t think they can do that.\u201d\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments \u2014 such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 \u2014 indicated Israel\u2019s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the \u201cIsrael attack\u201d on the hospital and called for an \u201cimmediate cease-fire\u201d \u2014 a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man \u2014 apparently involved in the aid effort \u2014 yells at the camera: \u201cIf there is bombing, I\u2019ll go in. If there is death, I\u2019ll go in. I came here determined to go in.\u201d\n\nAn accumulation of grievances \u2014 over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel\u2019s hard-right government \u2014 seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza \u2014 barred by Israel and Egypt \u2014 Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, \u201cin real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,\u201d she said."

    "content": "For Abood Okal and his family, the nights are the worst \u2014 and each night is worse than the last. When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.\n\nOkal and his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son Yousef left their home outside Boston last month for a long-planned reunion with their parents. They were supposed to fly home on Friday. Now they don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll be able to get back to the United States.\n\nOkal\u2019s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday\u2019s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.\n\nAs Okal spoke over the phone from the home of his wife\u2019s parents in the wee hours of Friday, there were at least eight audible explosions, with others in the distance.\n\nSleep is elusive. The bombs shake them awake, Okal said, and they find themselves coughing in air heavy with dust from pulverized buildings. He and his wife get up early, taking turns caring for their toddler and trying their best to pretend, for his sake, that everything will be all right.\n\nThe electricity is gone. The family is relying on a few solar panels, some batteries and power banks to recharge their phones and turn on a television for news. Their supply of milk and diapers is dwindling.\n\nThe market across the street has no bottled water left. Soon they will have to choose whether to risk going farther away in search of it, exposing themselves to more potential danger, or start drinking the water from a tank usually only used for washing or bathing.\n\nOkal works at pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb and lives in Medway, a small town southwest of Boston. He went to college in New Jersey and did graduate studies in Utah, where he developed a taste for snowboarding.\n\nOnce, when he was hiking in Zion National Park, he and a group of friends were trapped by a flash flood. After many hours, they managed to get out, but park rangers told them they were lucky to survive. Now that sense of visceral fear is with him almost all the time.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,\u201d he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen things on this scale,\u201d Okal said.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have tried to get on a list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but they\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s functioning or if they would be turned back. When Okal\u2019s sister, also an American citizen, went to the same crossing with her children earlier this week, it was bombed, Okal said. They fled for their lives.\n\nOkal and Abuzayda have made repeated phone calls to the U. S. embassies in Israel and Egypt, but there has been no concrete help so far \u2014 even as the United States announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate American citizens seeking to leave Israel.\n\nIf his son were at home, Okal said, he would be playing in their backyard on their swing set and going to day care. Now they barely step outside. He recently persuaded his parents to leave their neighborhood, which came under heavy bombardment, to come stay with him and his in-laws."

    "description": "What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.",
    "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, \u201cto lull Israel into complacency,\u201d while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters\u2019 apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n\u201cThose who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,\u201d said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried \u201cdata files on the territories and settlements they raided.\u201d\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: \u201cThe responsibility is mine,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cDespite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately \u2026 we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack."

Companies\u2019 efforts to stop access to violent videos have been stymied by an open internet that makes it easy to watch, save and share videos at viral speed \u2014 and by the changing strategies of killers and propagandists, who can use a network of distributed online services to ensure the videos remain forever within reach.\n\nA spokesman for Hamas\u2019s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in an audio message posted to the group\u2019s Telegram account this week that its fighters would kill hostages, one by one, every time an Israeli strike hits a home in Gaza, the dense coastal strip of more than 2 million Palestinians under Hamas control.\n\nThe executions, the spokesman said, would be broadcast in \u201caudio and video,\u201d though he did not specify where or when they would be shown. Hamas is believed to have abducted more than 100 people, mostly civilians, during its brutal assault on southern Israel. Some have already been killed, according to video reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nThe threat harks back to videos nearly a decade ago from the Islamic State, which spread fear and won attention by posting videos showing the beheadings of journalists, aid workers and other civilian captives. But those videos were prerecorded and edited. Hamas\u2019s pledge to record and air executions that have yet to take place is new and seems calibrated to incite fear over the barbarism to come.\n\n\u201cHamas\u2019s entire strategy is to inflict as much damage as possible and drive as much attention to that damage as possible, in order to incite fear for the broader public,\u201d said Graham Brookie, a senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. \u201cThis is one of the first times we\u2019ve seen this glossy propaganda content recorded in real time.\u201d\n\nMany of the videos feature relatively sophisticated touches, such as opening title animations and action-movie-style soundtracks, suggesting the group has a predesigned workflow for recording, editing and publication. Some of the videos appeared in edited form online within hours after the ambush began.\n\n\u201cHamas has been very well prepared for this and has created professional systems to get their message out,\u201d said Josh Lipowsky, a senior research analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group in Washington that tracks online extremism.\n\nSome researchers said they expect Hamas would publish any execution videos to Telegram, from which they are likely to be reposted to mainstream sites such as X, formerly known as Twitter, where they might gain millions of views.\n\nBut the group could also live-stream the executions to a social media platform or other website using a throwaway account, as mass killers have done in recent years. Those videos could then be saved and republished across a number of other video services, practically guaranteeing that the clips would never disappear from the web.\n\n\u201cYou cannot rule out a Christchurch-style broadcast,\u201d Brookie said, referring to the 2019 killings of 49 people inside two New Zealand mosques that were live-streamed on Facebook. \u201cThere are very few ways to stop that. It may reach only a few people in the moment, but it has the potential to go viral.\u201d\n\nTelegram, which did not respond to requests for comment, has largely tolerated violent content on its platform on the basis of promoting unrestrained free expression. Other lesser-known sites specialize in the sharing of extreme videos and do not respond to requests for removal.\n\nFacebook and other mainstream social networks pay for internal content-moderation systems and staffs to look for and block violent content. After the New Zealand shootings, 14 internet services and 55 international governments backed a policy argument, known as the Christchurch Call, designed to combat the sharing of extremist content. (Telegram is not among them.)\n\nBut the pact does not proactively monitor each live stream or shared video, and violent individuals have found ways to circumvent the rules. Last year, when a racist gunman live-streamed himself killing 10 people in a Buffalo grocery store, the video was streamed to Twitch, where it was removed within two minutes of the first gunshots \u2014 enough time for at least one viewer to repost it on other sites, including Facebook, where it was viewed millions of times.\n\nThe brutality showcased in Hamas\u2019s videos has proved especially graphic, even compared to videos from other conflict zones around the world, due partly to the group\u2019s preplanning and technological capabilities, Brookie said. In some of the videos, militants can be seen wearing GoPro cameras, so as to record the video from a more visceral, first-person perspective.\n\nSuch footage has become a more common facet of modern combat. Ukraine has used first-person video from soldiers\u2019 helmets and attack drones to document its war against Russian invaders. And the use of GoPro cameras on the battlefield was first popularized by Syria\u2019s volunteer Civil Defense force, known as the White Helmets, which have used them to record their rescues of civilians since Russia dispatched troops there in 2015."

    "description": "As some major platforms ban Hamas, others take a laissez-faire approach.",
    "content": "On Google\u2019s YouTube and Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, you can stand with Israel, call for peace or lament the plight of Palestinians. But expressions of support for Hamas are forbidden. Both companies consider Hamas an extremist organization, meaning that no one affiliated with the group is allowed to use their platforms, and no videos or images created by Hamas can be posted there.\n\nIn contrast, the influential messaging platform Telegram does very little content moderation. It hosts a Hamas channel that has been openly broadcasting grisly footage and images of dead Israelis to more than 100,000 subscribers. And some of those posts have been rebroadcast on Elon Musk\u2019s X, formerly Twitter, which nominally prohibits Hamas content but appears to be doing relatively little to police it after Musk laid off the majority of the company\u2019s employees.\n\nExperts say X in particular has become a hub for posts and videos taken down by other platforms for violating their rules against graphic violence or hate speech. On Tuesday, European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton posted a letter to Musk warning him that regulators have \u201cindications\u201d that the site may be in violation of European rules on violent and terrorist content, as well as disinformation.\n\nIn the case of the Israel-Gaza war, those calls are complicated by a desire to avoid being seen as abetting a terrorist organization by enabling it to broadcast propaganda, threats, hostage videos or even executions. Facebook has been sued in the past by the families of people killed by Hamas. And earlier this year, Google, Twitter and Meta defended themselves at the Supreme Court against charges that they had materially aided the Islamic State terrorist group  by hosting or recommending its content, such as recruiting videos. (In each of those cases, the tech firms prevailed.)\n\nBut defining what counts as an extremist group isn\u2019t always straightforward, and social media platforms over the years have faced scrutiny over which government actors, political movements, military operations and violent regimes get a voice and which don\u2019t. After the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan in 2021, social media companies had to make a high-stakes decision about whether to continue to ban the Taliban, since it had taken over the country\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cWithin social media companies, the category that you\u2019re placed in determines how your speech is going to be treated,\u201d said Anika Collier Navaroli, senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and a former senior Twitter policy official. \u201cThe speech of a political party is going to be treated extremely different than the speech that comes from a terrorist. The speech from a legitimate nation-state is also going to be treated different than somebody who is not recognized as that.\u201d\n\nOn TikTok, both the #Israel and #Palestine hashtags have attracted tens of billions of views as young people turn to the platform for news and perspectives on the conflict. But at least one prominent account that covers news from a Palestinian perspective received a notice Monday that it had been permanently banned. TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said Tuesday that the ban was a mistake and that the account, Mondoweiss, was reinstated.\n\nSince Hamas\u2019s incursion began, TikTok has shifted more content moderators to focus on posts about the conflict, including posts in Arabic and Hebrew, Favazza said. It has also been blocking some hashtags associated with graphic violence or terrorist propaganda, including footage of hostages or executions. And it is working with fact-checkers to identify misinformation, though a quick browse through popular searches such as \u201cIsrael\u201d and \u201cGaza\u201d on Tuesday turned up numerous videos from previous, unrelated conflicts that were being presented as though they were new. Other videos racked up views with graphic footage of Israeli victims, likely produced originally by Hamas, with a thin veneer of commentary decrying the acts.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement that the company had established \u201ca special operations center\u201d with experts who are fluent in Hebrew and Arabic to closely monitor the situation. \u201cOur teams are working around the clock to keep our platforms safe, take action on content that violates our policies or local law, and coordinate with third-party fact checkers in the region to limit the spread of misinformation,\u201d Stone said.\n\nOn Telegram, an apparently official Hamas account with close to 120,000 subscribers has routinely posted grisly video of the attacks on Israel. One clip, with more than 77,000 views, showed an unidentified militant stomping on a dead soldier\u2019s face. Many of the videos have been reposted to X. At least one of the videos was also posted by the media outlet Al Jazeera Arabic to YouTube, where it has nearly 13 million subscribers, but with some of the gore blurred."

    "description": "At least 260 bodies have been recovered from the site of a trance music festival in Israel, one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their surprise attack Saturday.",
    "content": "The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re\u2019im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.\n\nAt least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.\n\nThe attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. \u201cThe event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,\u201d ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.\n\nThe festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.\n\nBen Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. \u201cI took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.\u201d\n\nThey drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.\n\nOn Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.\n\nArgamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. \u201cIf she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn\u2019t have gone, but we knew nothing,\u201d Marciano said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, \u2018Go; you\u2019re young.\u2019 I regret that.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair."

    "description": "Despite reports of a deal to let dual nationals out and aid into Gaza, Israel and Hamas announced that there would be no cease-fire, dashing the hopes of hundreds.",
    "content": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel\u2019s war cabinet when the country\u2019s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah \u201cwill be opened\u201d so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nEgypt also believed a deal had been reached with the United States and Israel to open the crossing for almost five hours on Monday, to allow 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza and foreign passport holders to leave the strip, according to a person with knowledge of Egyptian diplomatic efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n\u201cIf we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,\u201d said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. \u201cIt fell in the sand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration\u2019s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East \u2014 essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation\u2019s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIsraeli officials said Monday that  the military was holding a number of gunmen that it captured during the attack. The Israel Defense Forces was also reviewing body-camera footage taken from some of the prisoners, as well as from slain Hamas fighters, giving the army more insight into their movements, planning and communications, Israel\u2019s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas\u2019s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza."

    "description": "Protesters from Morocco to Iran condemned Israel and the United States for a deadly hospital attack \u2014 dismissing Israeli statements blaming Palestinian militants.",
    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility, or Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201chitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel\u2019s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.\u201d Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached \u2014 or were considering \u2014 deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. \u201cWhere is the Arab army?\u201d university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to \u201cend all forms of normalization and cooperation\u201d with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n\u201cOf course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,\u201d he added. For that to change, \u201cthe Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn\u2019t them, and I don\u2019t think they can do that.\u201d\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments \u2014 such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 \u2014 indicated Israel\u2019s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the \u201cIsrael attack\u201d on the hospital and called for an \u201cimmediate cease-fire\u201d \u2014 a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man \u2014 apparently involved in the aid effort \u2014 yells at the camera: \u201cIf there is bombing, I\u2019ll go in. If there is death, I\u2019ll go in. I came here determined to go in.\u201d\n\nAn accumulation of grievances \u2014 over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel\u2019s hard-right government \u2014 seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza \u2014 barred by Israel and Egypt \u2014 Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, \u201cin real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,\u201d she said."

    "description": "\u201cWe must not lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas\u2019s appalling attacks,\u201d President Biden said Sunday.",
    "content": "That emphasis represented a shift for the Biden administration, which has given blanket support to Israel\u2019s military operations in advance of a ground invasion that human rights groups say will result in large-scale civilian casualties. But there was little sign Sunday of any substantive steps toward easing the situation in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israeli soldiers were \u201cready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.\u201d\n\nAs Secretary of State Antony Blinken touched down in Egypt on Sunday, relief supplies sat at an airport in Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, less than an hour\u2019s drive from the border with Gaza. Some of the aid supplies \u2014 delivered by regional countries such as Turkey, as well as the United Nations \u2014 have been stranded on Egypt\u2019s side of the border for days.\n\nDiplomats and others familiar with the discussions said one of the main obstacles to the delivery of that aid is the Israeli government\u2019s refusal to guarantee that it will not bomb relief trucks. One diplomatic official said negotiations were underway to allow Israel to inspect trucks entering Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on all parties to open the humanitarian corridor \u2014 to have a humanitarian pause in the conflict and to open the border, to allow supplies to go into children who need them right now,\u201d Jeremy Hopkins, Egypt representative for UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nTouma said her agency had not been able to confirm that water, or some water, had been restored. Gaza receives water through a variety of sources, aside from the public water network, including from private vendors. Desalination plants and pumping stations require fuel, which Israel was still blocking.\n\nOther diplomats were less optimistic than the Biden administration that progress was being made on the humanitarian front. \u201cGaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies\u201d even as aid stockpiled in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel itself could be \u201cdispatched with hours,\u201d U. N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a late afternoon statement. \u201cWe are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,\u201d he said, and neither the hostages being held by Hamas nor humanitarian aid to Gaza \u201cshould become bargaining chips.\u201d\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 2,600 people. Israel also warned more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, an order human rights groups have called impossible.\n\nBiden also said in the interview that Hamas needs to be eliminated entirely but that there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. But the president said he did not think Israel would pursue that path right now.\n\nIt said it shut access to an \u201carea up to four kilometers from the northern border with Lebanon\u201d on Sunday morning in response to an \u201cincident\u201d in northern Israel. It asked residents not to enter or approach the area and warned that GPS signals would be restricted."

    "content": "Jewish protesters and allies were arrested Monday after they blocked entrances to the White House to demand that President Biden urge a cease-fire in the Israel-Gaza war. The U.S. Secret Service arrested more than 30 people during the demonstration for alleged unlawful entry, such as crossing safety barricades, or for allegedly blocking entrances, Special Agent Steve Kopek, a spokesperson for the agency, said in a statement.\n\nThe demonstration, organized by Jewish groups IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace, came as Israel prepares for a major military offensive in the Gaza Strip amid an intensifying humanitarian crisis.\n\nBiden has expressed his steadfast support for Israel since the Oct. 7 attack, when gunmen from Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, broke through Israel\u2019s border, killing more than 1,400 people and taking others into Gaza as hostages, including some American citizens.\n\nSince then, airstrikes by the Israeli military on the Gaza Strip have killed more than 2,700 people and wounded almost 10,000. Israel also announced a full siege of Gaza \u2014 where more than 2 million people live, more than half of whom are children \u2014 by cutting off essential resources such as food, water, electricity and fuel.\n\nThose protesting Monday recited Kaddish, the mourner\u2019s prayer, sang Jewish songs and chanted \u201cNot in our name!,\u201d said IfNotNow communications director Matan Arad-Neeman, 25, of New York City.\n\n\u201cMany of us are in mourning. We have loved ones who were killed and kidnapped,\u201d said Arad-Neeman, who said an extended family member was killed in the recent violence. \u201cWe\u2019re also angry that our grief is being weaponized and that Israel is on the brink of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d\n\nArad-Neeman, who is Israeli American, said that although he is mourning alongside so many others, he does not want more violence to create more grieving Israeli or Palestinian families.\n\n\u201cAll of us are hoping and praying for a future where Israeli and Palestinians can live free of the fear of violence, and in true equality and justice,\u201d Arad-Neeman said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d"

    "description": "As Gazans flee, Israel\u2019s military leadership readies a broad offensive. But experts in urban warfare warn that the terrain is troublesome and the endgame uncertain.",
    "content": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that \u201cevery Hamas fighter\u201d will be \u201cdestroyed,\u201d while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to go back in, heavy, and it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,\u201d said Kenneth \u201cFrank\u201d McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be \u201cdragged out over a much longer period of time\u201d than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities \u2014 including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people \u2014 have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would \u201cend\u201d the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an \u201cintegrated and coordinated attack\u201d by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel\u2019s offensive is \u201cobviously going to be much larger\u201d now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be \u201cexponentially greater\u201d than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in \u201cdog fights\u201d between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has \u201cbecome very efficient\u201d at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces\u2019 advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas\u2019s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn\u2019t sustainable.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to go into Gaza again. They didn\u2019t want to occupy it. They didn\u2019t want to be responsible for administrating it,\u201d Misztal said. \u201cBut now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?\u201d\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel \u201cat this time\u201d \u2014 but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power."

    "description": "What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.",
    "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, \u201cto lull Israel into complacency,\u201d while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters\u2019 apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n\u201cThose who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,\u201d said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried \u201cdata files on the territories and settlements they raided.\u201d\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: \u201cThe responsibility is mine,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cDespite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately \u2026 we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack."

    "description": "Americans have been unable to cross into Egypt from Gaza after the Rafah crossing remained closed Saturday despite a U.S. deal to open it for several hours.",
    "content": "Before dawn on Saturday, Abood Okal and his family received the news they had desperately been waiting for. Okal and his wife and their 1-year-old son were finally offered a possible way out of Gaza \u2014 and back to their home near Boston. An email from the U.S. State Department told them the sole border crossing with Egypt \u201cmay be open\u201d for a five-hour window later that day, from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Okal and his family went to the Rafah crossing only to find it closed. There were no officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing except for a few plainclothes security guards whose job was to keep people from getting too close to the gate, Okal said.\n\nThe U. S. government had negotiated a deal to allow American citizens to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt during the five-hour window, U.S. officials said Saturday. But Palestinian and Egyptian officials failed to communicate about opening it, an official at the border said. By the end of the day, no one had been able to cross.\n\nWael Abu Omar, the Palestinian spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said Palestinian officials had not had any communication with their counterparts on the Egyptian side. Egyptian media outlets reported that Cairo would only allow foreigners to cross the border if aid shipments could be delivered to Gaza.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has said it would strike any trucks coming across the border, especially trucks carrying fuel, according to a diplomatic official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nOfficials are discussing the possibility of setting up a screening mechanism that would allow the Israelis to inspect goods in each vehicle entering Gaza, the diplomat said. Another official familiar with the talks over the aid deliveries said any agreement would require \u201cIsrael to stop bombing the enclave for a few hours.\u201d\n\nThe confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Rafah crossing comes as hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in response to an evacuation order from Israel\u2019s military, ahead of a possible ground invasion into the besieged enclave.\n\n\u201cWe have informed U. S. citizens in Gaza with whom we are in contact that if they assess it to be safe, they may wish to move closer to the Rafah border crossing,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that \u201cthere may be very little notice if the crossing opens and it may only open for a limited time.\u201d\n\nU. S. officials have spent the past several days trying to evacuate all U.S. staff in Gaza, a group of about 15 Palestinians that includes three U.S. government employees who work for USAID in Gaza, along with their immediate family members, according to a diplomatic official familiar with the situation.\n\nEach time, they\u2019ve been stopped at checkpoints near the border inside Gaza and have been unable to leave. In some cases at these checkpoints, the diplomatic official said, people identifying themselves as Hamas have said none of them will be able to leave until aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip.\n\nCanadian officials also told citizens on Friday that the Rafah crossing might open Saturday for a five-hour window to allow Canadians to exit. Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly told reporters Saturday that the \u201clatest information\u201d she had was that \u201cviolence\u201d in the area forced authorities to cancel the operation. She did not elaborate.\n\nOn Friday, Okal and his extended family had rushed south from  Jabalya in the north of Gaza after the Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate. They scrambled frantically to find cars to fit them all and a place to stay near the crossing.\n\nOkal, 36, and his family spent hours waiting under the hot sun Saturday. He said there were several hundred people there, including another American family from New Jersey. He said there were other foreign nationals too, including Canadians, Swedes, Spaniards and Norwegians.\n\nAs the day dragged on, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, took their exhausted toddler, Yousef, back to the home where they are staying with 30 other people, a short drive away. Food vendors near the crossing warned Okal that it was not safe to stay once the sun set. Still, he remained there until nearly 6 p.m., he said, hoping something might change. When he began to hear the sound of fighter planes and drones, he knew he had to leave the area."

    "description": "What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.",
    "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, \u201cto lull Israel into complacency,\u201d while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters\u2019 apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n\u201cThose who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,\u201d said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried \u201cdata files on the territories and settlements they raided.\u201d\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: \u201cThe responsibility is mine,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cDespite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately \u2026 we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack."

    "description": "Families had camped near the hospital seeking safety from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip. Israel has said a misfired Palestinian rocket was behind the blast.",
    "content": "Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday\u2019s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.\n\nPalestinian teams combed Wednesday through the blast zone \u2014 an area that radiated from a crater punched into pavement just outside the four-story complex. Cars were flipped over by the force of the explosion. Other vehicles were charred. The blast bent metal fencing and shattered windows.\n\nGaza\u2019s Health Ministry said 471 people were killed and more than 300 were injured, with 28 of the injured in critical condition. The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\u201cBecause of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,\u201d said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel\u2019s military said that part of a \u201cbarrage of rockets\u201d fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden\u2019s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.\n\nHundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City\u2019s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.\n\nVideo verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion \u2014 a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.\n\nHospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.\n\nMore than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died \u2014 many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion \u2014 and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.\n\nRegional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan\u2019s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war \u201chas entered a dangerous phase,\u201d and \u201cwill plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,\u201d according to a palace statement.\n\nBiden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack."

    "content": "Twenty miles east, at Jerusalem\u2019s popular Malha Mall, the parking lot is all but empty. Almost every shop is closed, here and across the country. Those who would normally work and shop are pouring into the ranks. Others are making their own preparations for a conflict that promises to be long-lasting and hard-hitting.\n\nPeople working in offices and fields just five days ago are back in uniform, some 360,000 of them so far, in one of the largest mobilizations in the country\u2019s history. Schools are closed. Local governments are straining to provide services as their workforces dwindle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working under fire now, but we have no choice,\u201d said Shaul Schneider, executive chairman of Ashdod Port, where crane operators 200 feet above the ground have to hope for the best when Hamas rockets scream overhead, sometimes 10 times a day. \u201cUnfortunately, Israel has experience in such situations.\u201d\n\nMuch of the country is eerily still. Streets normally jammed with honking traffic are quiet. Jaffa Street, a popular shopping strip in Jerusalem, was a ghost town Wednesday night, lined with flashing police cars. Construction sites are silent, and the Palestinian laborers who normally work at them have been prohibited from crossing over from the West Bank since Saturday.\n\nMuch of the shopping to be seen is families scrambling to stock up on essentials. Israel\u2019s military Home Front Command instructed citizens on Monday to equip their bomb shelters and basements with three days of supplies. Apartment buildings instructed residents to remove bikes and personal items from safe rooms and stock them with emergency provisions.\n\nFor Palestinians living in Israel, staying out of sight is a basic preparation for war. All have memories of the fighting between Arabs and Jews inside Israel and say they can feel the fury being directed at Hamas.\n\nHazem, a cabdriver in Jerusalem who gave only his first name to protect his identity, has mostly stayed inside since he had his children brought home early from school Saturday. On a cabbies\u2019 WhatsApp group, he read of a taxi driver being beaten by Jewish settlers outside the city. When he does go out, he is stopped by soldiers.\n\nIt was only hours after the Hamas attacks Saturday when Barak Zachri got the first WhatsApp message from his old combat intelligence unit. By the end of the day, dozens of members had agreed to sign up together.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, he was among those gathered on the curb outside Julis military base near Ashkelon, some in old fatigues, some in shorts and T-shirts. Another car pulled up every few minutes, setting off another set of tight hugs from parents and partners, many of them in tears. Just 12 miles away, air force planes were bombing the Gaza enclave, home to 2 million people and likely the target of an imminent ground war.\n\nReports have circulated all week that the military is struggling to equip the huge numbers of reservists reporting for duty. Army officials say their supplies are keeping up, but civilians have organized equipment and food drives across the country.\n\n\u201cWe need a switchboard, so many people are calling,\u201d Kolinsky-Dover, the mother of two soldiers, said after fielding another cash donation offer. The Venmo account she just set up has already received more than $8,000.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re in our current situation is because Israeli society is not connected,\u201d co-owner Yotam Doktor said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t come to our senses and join forces, the situation will become even worse.\u201d"

    "content": "But any sense of public comity between Washington and its Arab partners was shattered Tuesday as gruesome images emerged at the site of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian authorities say an Israeli airstrike killed up to 500 people in the attack. Israel denies the charge, saying the facility was blown up by errant rocket fire from an Islamist militant group. The White House, citing preliminary U. S. intelligence, has sided with Israel.\n\nThe hospital blast has \u201cderailed a much-needed opportunity to make meaningful progress on the near-term solution to the Gaza crisis,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAnd by inflaming opinion across the Arab world, it has heightened prospects for escalation and a much more dangerous and protracted conflict in the region.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what made him think that, Biden cited the \u201cdata I was shown by my Defense Department,\u201d without elaborating. The National Security Council later issued a statement attributing the U. S. intelligence assessment to \u201coverhead imagery, intercepts and open source information,\u201d though so far it has not publicly disclosed any of those materials.\n\nThe United States switched, for instance, its policy seeking safe passage for Palestinian civilians through Egypt in response to meetings with Abbas and Sisi, who opposed the proposal out of fear that fleeing Palestinians may never be able to return to Gaza.\n\nThat led up to what Biden announced on Wednesday: an agreement with Israel to allow the delivery of aid on the condition that there will be inspections and that the aid won\u2019t go to Hamas. \u201cIsrael agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut a critical player on aid delivery is Egypt, which controls part of the Rafah border crossing, and Hamas, which controls the other half. That is why Arab leaders, who have communication links with Hamas and other key players on the ground, were viewed as a critical part of Biden\u2019s trip."

    "description": "The Israeli army escorted a group of journalists inside the town of Kfar Azza on Tuesday as bodies were recovered. \u201cIt is a big massacre,\u201d a general said. \u201cA catastrophe.\u201d",
    "content": "Military officials said the village was finally secured late Monday after 2\u00bd days of intense fighting. But with regular explosions overhead and black plumes of smoke rising above the Gaza Strip just over a mile away, the battle felt far from over.\n\nThe Israeli army escorted a group of journalists inside the town early Tuesday as the recovery of bodies was beginning. The pastoral community of about 400 is one of the closest to Israel\u2019s sophisticated border fence with Gaza, which Hamas militants breached with apparent ease Saturday before rampaging through town after town. The burned homes and crushed cars here were surrounded by unmarked fields and groves. Water poured down the slope from a busted main.\n\nKfar Azza was still off limits to the residents who had time to flee. So many didn\u2019t survive the shocking invasion, which shattered the peace of a weekend morning so suddenly that full cups of coffee and a jug of milk still sat on the table in one kitchen. The floor was smeared with blood.\n\nOutside, the air was heavy with the smell of smoke and death. Many of these low, boxy houses contained more bodies, said Maj. Gen. Itai Veruv \u2014 those of slain residents and perhaps more of their attackers. He couldn\u2019t say how many.\n\nVeruv was the commander of the huge defensive operation that the Israel Defense Forces scrambled to mount after being caught badly off guard on the last day of the Jewish Sukkot holiday. He was officially retired until he heard the news, just after dawn, that villages in the south had been overrun.\n\nBy 9 a.m., he was in the area, where he stayed for three days, bearing witness to the worst scenes he has seen in 40 years of service. \u201cI never saw anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI never imagined.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers have tried to understand how the attack unfolded by looking at the bullet scars on the wall, and the pattern of a dozen dead infiltrators whose bodies still lay on lawns and sidewalks \u2014 among some 1,500 bodies of Palestinian militants the military says it has found across Israel. There was a crashed paraglider near a bus stop where one of the gunmen had descended from the sky. One of their motorcycles lay on its side near a pickup truck with shattered windows, its emergency lights still flashing.\n\nThe town\u2019s small security squad \u2014 residents with guns \u2014 gathered toward the western edge of the compound when the attackers came, Veruv said. He pointed out a block of houses they called \u201cthe baby section,\u201d because of all the young families who lived here. Those who were armed clearly fought, the soldiers said, but many didn\u2019t survive.\n\nMost of the vehicles in a sandy parking area were heavily damaged, with bullet holes and broken windshields and doors twisted out of shape. The infiltrators apparently went down the line, looking for cars to steal. \u201cThey wanted a way to take hostages,\u201d one soldier said.\n\nOne team loaded white body bags into the back of the truck. Another worked with six black bags, some with the Star of David, gathering them in the shade of a tree. At the entrance to the kibbutz, a crowd of Orthodox volunteers wearing yarmulkes, rubber gloves and safety vests waited  to make sure all remains had been collected, a requirement for Jewish burial.\n\nSome civilians still lay where they fell. Behind one house, a woman with bare feet and red pants had been covered with a cloth; a man in shorts was in the stream of water from the damaged main.\n\nA column of troop carriers rolled into the compound, and then another one. A tank rumbled past the farm equipment that sat idly at the edge of a field. Israel was reinforcing its hold on a community that, for days, it had lost.\n\nThe IDF said Tuesday that it was increasingly confident that the area was secure, and that its forces were preparing to go on the offensive against Hamas."

    "description": "Protesters from Morocco to Iran condemned Israel and the United States for a deadly hospital attack \u2014 dismissing Israeli statements blaming Palestinian militants.",
    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility, or Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201chitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel\u2019s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.\u201d Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached \u2014 or were considering \u2014 deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. \u201cWhere is the Arab army?\u201d university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to \u201cend all forms of normalization and cooperation\u201d with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n\u201cOf course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,\u201d he added. For that to change, \u201cthe Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn\u2019t them, and I don\u2019t think they can do that.\u201d\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments \u2014 such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 \u2014 indicated Israel\u2019s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the \u201cIsrael attack\u201d on the hospital and called for an \u201cimmediate cease-fire\u201d \u2014 a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man \u2014 apparently involved in the aid effort \u2014 yells at the camera: \u201cIf there is bombing, I\u2019ll go in. If there is death, I\u2019ll go in. I came here determined to go in.\u201d\n\nAn accumulation of grievances \u2014 over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel\u2019s hard-right government \u2014 seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza \u2014 barred by Israel and Egypt \u2014 Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, \u201cin real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,\u201d she said."

    "description": "Families had camped near the hospital seeking safety from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip. Israel has said a misfired Palestinian rocket was behind the blast.",
    "content": "Then, in a towering flash of flame and debris, many of those displaced by the war in Gaza became casualties of the conflict. Images after late Tuesday\u2019s strike showed men, women and children, many covered in dust and blood, crowding into the hospital for treatment even as Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, traded accusations over who was to blame.\n\nPalestinian teams combed Wednesday through the blast zone \u2014 an area that radiated from a crater punched into pavement just outside the four-story complex. Cars were flipped over by the force of the explosion. Other vehicles were charred. The blast bent metal fencing and shattered windows.\n\nGaza\u2019s Health Ministry said 471 people were killed and more than 300 were injured, with 28 of the injured in critical condition. The attack is the single deadliest incident for civilians in Gaza in a war that has already killed more Palestinians and Israeli civilians than any previous conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\u201cBecause of the airstrikes everywhere else in Gaza, people left to take shelter in this hospital. Children, women, elders, patients, a huge number of people went to the hospital for refuge, following calls of evacuation and constant bombardment,\u201d said Mahmoud Bassal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who was behind the al-Ahli Hospital blast. Israel\u2019s military said that part of a \u201cbarrage of rockets\u201d fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area. Hamas maintains that an Israeli airstrike hit the site. Neither claim could be immediately verified by The Washington Post.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Security Council reaffirmed President Biden\u2019s comments that the U. S. government does not assess that Israel is responsible for the blast, saying that U.S. officials continue to collect information.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.\n\nHundreds of injured civilians were rushed to Gaza City\u2019s main hospital, al-Shifa, where doctors reported that they had to treat the wounded on the hospital floor after running out of beds.\n\nVideo verified by The Post captured the first sounds of an explosion \u2014 a whirring through the air and then a blast. The camera pans to show fire and orange plumes of smoke.\n\nHospitals in Gaza warned they were already running out of generator fuel, morgues were filling up and overstretched rescue workers reported they were unable to recover more than 1,000 bodies from beneath buildings destroyed by airstrikes.\n\nMore than 10 hospitals have been damaged by airstrikes since war broke out between Hamas and Israel. Medical workers have also been killed in the violence. With the death toll ticking up daily, more than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating campaign of airstrikes against Hamas after militants slipped into Israel on Oct. 7 in a blitz of killing and hostage-taking. About 1,400 Israelis have died \u2014 many in the first hours of the Hamas incursion \u2014 and about 200 people were taken back to Gaza.\n\nRegional leaders also issued calls for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Jordan\u2019s king, Abdullah II, warned that the war \u201chas entered a dangerous phase,\u201d and \u201cwill plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster,\u201d according to a palace statement.\n\nBiden spent Wednesday in Israel in what was supposed to be the first stop on a Middle East tour, but his itinerary began to unravel after mourning periods were announced for victims of the hospital attack."

    "content": "Over the same period, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 60 Palestinians in the West Bank and injured more than 1,300, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has also locked down parts of the West Bank, closing roads and putting up checkpoints to prevent Palestinians from moving between towns and cities.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in 1967. Under the Oslo accords, brokered by President Bill Clinton in 1993, those territories were meant to form a Palestinian state. But the U. S.-led peace process has been dormant for years. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded. Members of Israel\u2019s current government, the most far-right in its history, have called openly for annexation.\n\nSince 2007, when Hamas violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip, Abbas has cracked down on supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza, as well as on his own critics. Long-promised elections have never been held. Despair has deepened in the impoverished refugee camps that still dot the West Bank.\n\nOver the past two years, camps in Nablus, Jenin and elsewhere have become incubators for a new generation of armed groups that have carried out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians. Israel has responded with massive military raids across the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians here since the end of the second intifada in 2005.\n\n\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d said the 38-year-old militant, a father of three, speaking on the condition that he be identified by his childhood nickname to protect his security. Zoufi said he awoke on Oct. 7 to the news of Hamas\u2019s rampage and asked his wife to slap him to make sure he wasn\u2019t dreaming. Then he laughed with joy.\n\nZoufi is affiliated with Fatah but opposes the Palestinian Authority\u2019s nonviolent approach. He founded his militant cell last year. Balata is home to some 30,000 people and has no proper police force. The same is true in other camps in Nablus and Jenin and throughout the northern West Bank. In these communities, the militants are the ones in charge.\n\n\u201cIf Israel will do a stupid thing like the ground invasion, war will break out not only in the West Bank and inside Israel but also around the Arab world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want liberation, not bloodshed. ... I hope it will stop before it comes to that.\u201d\n\nMohamed Hamdan, the secretary general of Fatah in Nablus, defended Abbas and his efforts to revive peace negotiations. He said the authority was doing its best to maintain order and rein in weapons on the street. But the international community had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Palestinians, he said."

    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 A Reuters videographer was killed and six other journalists were wounded Friday in southern Lebanon when the area they were reporting from was struck by Israeli shelling, according to two colleagues who spoke to the injured journalists in the hospital, as well as an eyewitness. Charbel Francis, a cameraman for Al Araby TV, said he was filming a barrage of Israeli shelling on a hill, while standing about 50 feet from the other journalists, when the strike landed. The battle was in the distance, and there was no indication that fire from Lebanon was coming from anywhere near the journalists.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed,\u201d a Reuters statement read, adding that Abdallah was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon providing live coverage of skirmishes along the border. Two other Reuters journalists, Thaer al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh, \u201csustained injuries and are seeking medical care,\u201d the news agency said.\n\nThe statement did not specify who was responsible. Reuters later reported, citing one of its journalists who was at the scene, that missiles \u201cfired from the direction of Israel\" struck the group.\n\nA spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said Saturday that it was \"very sorry\u201d for the journalist\u2019s death but that it was not sure who was responsible and that Israel would investigate.\n\nAl Jazeera said the journalists had all gathered in one area for safety in Alma al-Chaab, a village in south Lebanon. In video posted earlier on Friday by AFP journalist Christina Assi, who was among the injured, several reporters could be seen wearing blue bullet-resistant vests marked with the word \u201cPress.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press \u2014 which had a photographer on the scene \u2014 reported that an Israeli shell landed near the group during an exchange of fire with Hezbollah. The area had previously been a target of Israeli strikes, according to a Lebanese security source cited by AFP.\n\nReporters Without Borders said Abdallah was \u201ckilled by an Israeli strike while covering the situation on the southern border\u201d in Lebanon. The press advocacy group described it as a \u201cheinous crime against journalists\u201d and said it was \u201ccontinuing its investigations into the circumstances of this tragedy.\u201d\n\nAl Jazeera said in a statement that its broadcast vehicle was \u201ccompletely burned,\u201d adding it holds Israel \"responsible for this brutal attack and calls on the international community to take action to ensure the safety of journalists.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a mission set up in 1978 to monitor the border between Lebanon and Israel, said in a statement posted on social media that a \u201cheavy exchange of fire\u201d erupted in the area beginning at 5:20 p.m. Live footage carried on several news channels showed what appeared to be sustained shelling into Lebanese territory that lasted for about an hour.\n\nA live stream from the area showed the hillside as the blast hit. A woman is heard screaming \u201cI can\u2019t feel my legs\u201d before the feed is cut. Lebanese television broadcasts showed a woman in a press vest writhing on the ground, with fire billowing and a car burning in the background.\n\nAbdallah, 37, a video journalist based in Beirut, had covered conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and other major stories, including earthquakes that devastated southern Turkey this year. A wide circle of colleagues, friends and admirers posted tributes to Abdallah on social media Friday, and held a vigil for him in Beirut.\n\n\u201cHe was genuinely one of the most kind and heartwarming people one could know. Totally selfless, a bundle of laughs and an extremely kind individual,\u201d said Tariq Keblaoui, who said that a few weeks ago, Abdallah had helped him escape a protest that was being attacked.\n\nColleagues also remembered him as a \u201cbrave friend\u201d and some journalists recounted during a funeral procession held for him on Saturday that he often told them there was \u201cno story worth your life.\u201d"

    "content": "Return to menu\n\nThe Ottoman Empire had controlled that part of the Middle East from the early 16th century until control of most of the region was granted to the British after World War I.\n\nBoth Israelis and Palestinians were struggling for self-determination and sovereignty over the territory, developing respective movements for their causes.\n\nAs World War I began, several controversial diplomatic efforts \u2014 some contradicting each other \u2014 by the Great Powers tried to shape the map of the modern Middle East, including the Palestinian territories. Palestinians cite a series of letters in 1915 to 1916 between Mecca\u2019s emir and the British high commissioner in Egypt, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, as outlining a promise of an independent Arab state.\n\nIn 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly negotiated between Britain and France planned to carve up the Middle East into spheres of influence, and determined that the land in question was to be internationalized.\n\nIn 1917, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, expressed his government\u2019s support for \u201cthe establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\u201d in a letter to Baron Walter Rothschild, the head of the British wing of the influential European Jewish banking family.\n\nTo Israelis, the missive marks a formal utterance of the Israeli state\u2019s right to exist; to Palestinians, it was an early sign of their dispossession. The declaration also noted that it was \u201cclearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,\u201d nodding to the overwhelming majority Arab population in the region at the time. (About 90 percent of the population was Muslim in 1850, and about 80 percent in 1914.)\n\nLarge-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Both sides continued to assert their right to establish a state."

Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.In conversations with congressional staffers, Biden aides have discussed proposing as soon as this week a major foreign policy package amid numerous international crises, including the war between Hamas and Israel. The legislation is also expected to include substantial funds to bolster U.S. immigration enforcement at the southern border with Mexico, and may include funds for Taiwan to deter aggression from China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations. Money to respond to recent U.S. natural disasters, including wildfires in Maui and various hurricanes, could also be folded into the legislation.\n\nAides stressed that the plans were highly uncertain and subject to change. President Biden previously proposed roughly $20.4 billion in funding for Ukraine, but Congress blocked any additional money for Ukraine when it extended government funding into November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make a strong statement to our enemies and to our friends,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said about the proposed aid package.\n\nOne person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said the request would cover a full fiscal year for the crises it is intended to address.\n\nDemocratic leaders said they expect to receive the proposal at the end of this week.\n\n\u201cWe intend to get the package at the end of this week and it will include the military help Israel needs, the diplomatic and intelligence help Israel needs, as well as humanitarian aid to minimize the loss of innocent human life, of Palestinians and of Israelis,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) told reporters.\n\nThe effort comes as House Republicans struggle to elect a new speaker, which could complicate efforts to pass any bill swiftly. House Republicans have grown increasingly wary of providing taxpayer funds to Kyiv, but may be more likely to do so if a request also includes money for the border and Israel.\n\nBloomberg reported earlier that White House officials were considering a $100 billion request in the aid package. It was unclear how much money would be included for each country."

Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter, while the Israel Defense Forces blamed an errant rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying \u201ca barrage of rockets\u201d was passing near the hospital when it was hit.\n\nThe hospital blast has set off fierce protests in the Middle East, including in Jordan, where the Israeli Embassy was surrounded by protesters Tuesday evening. A planned visit by Biden to Amman on Wednesday was canceled after the strike, forcing the U. S. president to forgo a scheduled meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nSome security experts said the physical risk to Biden would be relatively small despite the chaos in the region. Biden is one of the most protected people on the planet, they said, and Air Force One is equipped with sophisticated air defense systems that can thwart incoming rockets and missiles.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a rarity for a president to travel directly into a region where hostilities are intensifying, with an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza expected within days and fears that the militant group Hezbollah might enter the fray. Biden faces at least some risk when he is on the ground in Tel Aviv, a city Hamas rockets are able to reach. In Amman, which Biden had planned to visit after his stop in Tel Aviv, the situation remains combustible.\n\n\u201cBeing in an active area of hostilities, they have to look very carefully at the threats that Israel is facing now, understanding that the president will be on the ground,\u201d said Jonathan Lord, senior fellow and director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cSo they\u2019re definitely thinking about Israel\u2019s air defense capabilities and protecting the president from Hamas rockets.\u201d\n\nThe crisis erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants broke through Israel\u2019s sophisticated border fence with Gaza and hunted Israeli civilians in their cars and homes, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages into Gaza, including some Americans. Tensions have only grown since then as the brutality and scope of Hamas\u2019s attacks have become clearer and as Israel has launched repeated deadly airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nBiden\u2019s visit comes as Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion that it says is an effort to destroy Hamas, potentially setting off one of the worst conflicts in the region in decades. U. S. officials are deeply concerned that the war could spread and draw in such actors as Hezbollah or Iran.\n\nBiden has stressed his ironclad support for Israel since the Hamas attacks, but in recent days, he has sought to strike a more delicate balance between support for Israel\u2019s right to self-defense and concern about civilians in Gaza, where conditions have rapidly deteriorated.\n\nGaza is a densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. Even without a formal occupation, Israel controls almost all aspects of life in the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, water, electricity and fuel \u2014 tactics that human rights groups have said violate international law.\n\nThe country has also unleashed an unrelenting bombardment campaign and warned more than 1 million Palestinians to flee northern Gaza to avoid being in harm\u2019s way, an order that the United Nations called impossible. Biden and his top aides have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors so that Palestinian civilians can flee and aid can get into the Palestinian territory.\n\nExperts said Biden\u2019s trip to Kyiv this year was in some ways more dangerous than the Israel trip because Russia has a far more sophisticated military than Hamas. Although Hamas is arguably a far more unpredictable entity, its militants are unlikely to have the technology or prowess to launch a targeted attack against an American president.\n\n\u201cThe risk to the president himself is probably pretty minimal. He is surrounded by Secret Service and the Israelis will provide additional protection layers,\u201d Riedel said. He added that Biden flying in and out of the Middle East in one day, rather than staying in an easily identifiable location overnight, further minimizes the risks.\n\n\u201cI think we have seen a significant shift in the administration\u2019s position,\u201d Riedel said. \u201cOn October 7th, it was, \u2018We\u2019re 100 percent behind Israel. We have Israel\u2019s back.\u2019 We\u2019re still behind Israel, we still have Israel\u2019s back \u2014 but we\u2019re also eager to avoid significant civilian casualties in Gaza and we do not want the conflict to spread to other areas.\u201d"

    "description": "Protesters from Morocco to Iran condemned Israel and the United States for a deadly hospital attack \u2014 dismissing Israeli statements blaming Palestinian militants.",
    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility, or Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201chitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel\u2019s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.\u201d Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached \u2014 or were considering \u2014 deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. \u201cWhere is the Arab army?\u201d university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to \u201cend all forms of normalization and cooperation\u201d with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n\u201cOf course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,\u201d he added. For that to change, \u201cthe Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn\u2019t them, and I don\u2019t think they can do that.\u201d\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments \u2014 such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 \u2014 indicated Israel\u2019s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the \u201cIsrael attack\u201d on the hospital and called for an \u201cimmediate cease-fire\u201d \u2014 a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man \u2014 apparently involved in the aid effort \u2014 yells at the camera: \u201cIf there is bombing, I\u2019ll go in. If there is death, I\u2019ll go in. I came here determined to go in.\u201d\n\nAn accumulation of grievances \u2014 over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel\u2019s hard-right government \u2014 seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza \u2014 barred by Israel and Egypt \u2014 Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, \u201cin real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,\u201d she said."

    "description": "The strike on the hospital came as President Biden was set to visit the region and humanitarian aid for Gaza remained stranded on the Egyptian border.",
    "content": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden\u2019s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country\u2019s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza\u2019s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n\u201cWe all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,\u201d Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. \u201cThey go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?\u201d\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid."

    "description": "Authorities say the conflict between Israel and Gaza was a factor in the killing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in Illinois who was stabbed 26 times.",
    "content": "On Saturday, a week after Hamas militants launched a devastating attack on Israel, Czuba allegedly knocked on the Palestinian family\u2019s door just after 11 a.m. When the mother, Hanaan Shahin, answered, Czuba assaulted her with a serrated military-style knife while yelling anti-Muslim statements, forcing her to run to the bathroom to call 911, according to local authorities and the family\u2019s statements at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nWhen Shahin emerged from the bathroom after calling police, according to the accounts, she found Czuba attacking her 6-year-old son, Wadea Alfayoumi, who later died of his wounds. He had been stabbed 26 times, the Will County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement. Shahin, 32, was stabbed at least a dozen times and remains hospitalized in serious condition, the family said.\n\nWhen authorities arrived, Czuba was sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration to his forehead, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. He was taken to a hospital for treatment but did not make any statements to detectives when later questioned, the sheriff\u2019s office added.\n\nPresident Biden said in a statement that he was \u201csickened\u201d to hear of the deadly attack in Illinois, which \u201cstands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.\u201d\n\nBefore the service, speakers implored elected officials and members of the news media to employ greater caution, compassion and clarity in the days ahead because their roles are pivotal in fostering an environment that can give way to hate crimes. Speakers demanded an apology from President Biden for claiming to have seen photos of alleged Hamas-driven atrocities that his administration later clarified he had not seen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more than just a man that stabbed a 6-year-old boy here,\u201d Imam Omar Suleiman said. \u201cI want you to think about what was in his head. What type of hate has to be manufactured in the head of a man for him to stand over a 6-year-old boy and stab him 26 times?\u201d\n\nThe attack came a week after Hamas militants raided communities in southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people there and injuring more than 3,842, authorities said. Palestinian officials said 2,670 people in Gaza have been killed and 9,600 wounded after Israel began a bombing campaign ahead of an expected ground invasion.\n\nThe brutality of the latest outbreak of warfare has unleashed language from all sides that is so hateful and dehumanizing that it has shocked even longtime observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. International peace activists repeatedly have warned that the ugly rhetoric could inspire violent retaliations in the United States, citing dark precedents such as the targeting of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the increase in antisemitic incidents after previous flare-ups involving Israel.\n\nIn the past few days, Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups have documented vandalism or bomb threats at synagogues and mosques, along with hateful messages and swastikas scrawled in their communities. Arab and Muslim rights groups say they have fielded calls from people reporting that they have been fired or silenced for expressing pro-Palestinian views.\n\nAuthorities gave few details about Czuba. As news of his arrest spread, people who live nearby said in community forums on Facebook that Czuba had long alarmed residents with yard signs telegraphing his \u201cextreme\u201d views. One woman wrote that she had alerted local officials about the \u201cunhinged\u201d man. The Post contacted the woman seeking details but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nThe Palestinian tenants had seen the signs but did not understand their symbolism and had not experienced the landlord\u2019s extremist side until recently, said Yousef Hannon, an uncle and family spokesman who was sitting with the slain child\u2019s father, Odai Alfayoumi, during a phone interview.\n\nWadea was born in the United States to Palestinian parents who moved here more than a decade ago and have since divorced. The extended family, which has roots in both the West Bank and Gaza, already was reeling this week from the perils faced by relatives who are fleeing the Israeli siege and retaliatory strikes that followed the Hamas-led attack. Hannon said they never imagined that the tentacles of war would stretch all the way to the Chicago suburbs."

Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.In conversations with congressional staffers, Biden aides have discussed proposing as soon as this week a major foreign policy package amid numerous international crises, including the war between Hamas and Israel. The legislation is also expected to include substantial funds to bolster U.S. immigration enforcement at the southern border with Mexico, and may include funds for Taiwan to deter aggression from China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations. Money to respond to recent U.S. natural disasters, including wildfires in Maui and various hurricanes, could also be folded into the legislation.\n\nAides stressed that the plans were highly uncertain and subject to change. President Biden previously proposed roughly $20.4 billion in funding for Ukraine, but Congress blocked any additional money for Ukraine when it extended government funding into November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make a strong statement to our enemies and to our friends,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said about the proposed aid package.\n\nOne person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said the request would cover a full fiscal year for the crises it is intended to address.\n\nDemocratic leaders said they expect to receive the proposal at the end of this week.\n\n\u201cWe intend to get the package at the end of this week and it will include the military help Israel needs, the diplomatic and intelligence help Israel needs, as well as humanitarian aid to minimize the loss of innocent human life, of Palestinians and of Israelis,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) told reporters.\n\nThe effort comes as House Republicans struggle to elect a new speaker, which could complicate efforts to pass any bill swiftly. House Republicans have grown increasingly wary of providing taxpayer funds to Kyiv, but may be more likely to do so if a request also includes money for the border and Israel.\n\nBloomberg reported earlier that White House officials were considering a $100 billion request in the aid package. It was unclear how much money would be included for each country."

We were too patient, too gentle. I think the nation is now united to do what  should have been done a long time ago.\u201d\n\nIsrael has said it is ready to crush Hamas, and residents here are shipping out as Gaza braces for the force of an all-out assault. Like other communities along the 40-mile fence with Israel, the streets of Sderot now lie largely empty save for security forces, volunteers and the smattering of residents  who have decided to stay. Nine out of  10 people in the working-class southern city of 30,000 people have left.\n\nIn recent days, much of Sderot and its surroundings has been declared a closed security zone as the military prepares staging grounds on the border. New concrete road blocks have been installed to stop traffic as artillery blasts out shells into Gaza.\n\nFrom an overlook in the city, beyond the supposedly impenetrable border fence that Hamas made light work of in  the Oct. 7 assault, the Gazan cities of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia stretch out below. Black plumes rise from the sky as shells from Israeli tanks hit their mark, with the sound of explosions occasionally punctuated by the rattle of machine gun fire.\n\nAn Arabic speaker after having grown up in Morocco before emigrating to Israel, she has fond memories of visiting Gaza to eat fish and attend weddings before the 40-mile-long separation fence was constructed to pen off the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut now she\u2019d like to see it erased. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d go kill them all,\u201d she said, letting out an \u201coy, oy, oy\u201d at the boom of outgoing artillery at the end of a temporary humanitarian cease-fire.\n\nShe\u2019s the first call of the day for Malka Stein, a nurse from Rescuers Without Borders, who had traveled from northern Israel to volunteer. But now she thinks she may be needed more at home, as the Israeli government moved to evacuate 28 communities close to the Lebanese border, amid fears of a broader conflagration with Hezbollah.\n\nAs a second group waited for a ride out, a rocket flashed across the sky and people rushed toward the school shelter, reminding some of their reasons for leaving. About 74 rockets have made direct hits on homes here over the past week.\n\nBut for some, the decision is harder than others. Yossi and Shmurit Edrich\u2019s baby was born on Oct. 6, just hours before Hamas\u2019s incursion into their town. Premature and weighing just over 4 pounds, the baby has to stay in the hospital for a week.\n\nThe city has emptied out before, but people are expecting a longer haul this time, said Ayelet Shmuel, director of the city\u2019s resilience center. \u201cThe city knows how to run,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this time we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we are going for our revenge,\u201d said Capt. Nadav Mizrahi, a reserve officer deployed with a tank brigade. \u201cTo destroy everything from top to bottom,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can do it. It will take time and cost lives.

    "description": "The link between Egypt and Gaza is the only route for aid convoys to enter and foreign citizens to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave.",
    "content": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt\u2019s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel\u2019s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt \u2014 on the conditions they are limited to \u201cfood, water and medicine for the civilian population\u201d and do not reach Hamas."

    "description": "The trip to show support comes as Israel mourns victims of Hamas\u2019s attack and readies a Gaza invasion that some warn could devastate civilians.",
    "content": "Biden will also visit Jordan, where he plans to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has endured Israeli airstrikes that have killed more than 2,700 Palestinians.\n\nHamas has taken scores of hostages into Gaza, including an unknown number of Americans. Biden will work to get as much information about the hostage situation as possible during his trip, White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing with reporters Monday evening.\n\nKirby emphasized that the United States had not sought assurances that Israel would not launch its ground invasion while Biden was visiting the country. \u201cWe\u2019re not dictating terms or operational directions to the Israelis,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see escalation. We want to make sure humanitarian assistance begins to flow.\u201d\n\nStill, U. S. officials waited to announce Biden\u2019s travel to Israel on Monday night until they received commitments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a humanitarian package, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken received assurances during a marathon meeting in Tel Aviv this week and then made the announcement that Biden would be visiting.\n\nDuring the 7\u00bd-hour meeting, Israeli and U. S. officials set up separate rooms and passed papers between the two sides, negotiating over humanitarian issues including getting aid into Gaza and creating safe zones for Palestinian civilians, said a State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.\n\nThough Blinken hailed an agreement on humanitarian issues, his announcement included few details, probably an indication that differences remain between the two allies. The provision of humanitarian aid is sensitive in Israel, especially among far-right politicians tied to Netanyahu who have pressed him to wage a scorched-earth campaign in Gaza in response to the terrorist attack.\n\nThe White House is deeply concerned about the conflict spiraling into a broader regional conflagration, and Biden has warned other actors, particularly Iran, not to jump in. His visit to Israel could underline that message.\n\nOfficials are also worried that anger in Arab countries, where many citizens have deep sympathy for the Palestinian cause, could boil over and create pressure for their leaders to take action against Israel.\n\nBiden has repeatedly emphasized his support for Israel and said the country has a duty to respond to the horrific attack, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas breached Israel\u2019s sophisticated border fence in several places before hunting civilians in their homes and cars and shooting people indiscriminately.\n\nBut the president and his top aides have also sought to draw a distinction between Hamas and Palestinian civilians. In recent days, they have stressed their efforts to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow into Gaza and to secure a humanitarian corridor where Palestinian Americans can leave the densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children.\n\nIsrael has said its goal is to eliminate Hamas and has urged more than 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza to avoid being in harm\u2019s way, an order the United Nations called impossible. It also announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, fuel, electricity and water, which human rights groups have said violates international law.\n\nBiden spoke with Sisi on Monday, the White House said, and the two discussed \u201congoing efforts to alleviate the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the U. N., Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and other regional partners.\u201d\n\nEgypt has helped broker cease-fires between Israel and Palestine during past incursions and plays a critical role in ongoing efforts to secure humanitarian assistance. And on Egypt\u2019s border with Gaza, the Rafah crossing could be the only way out for Palestinians seeking to flee the enclave amid Israel\u2019s bombardment campaign.\n\nBlinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Sisi, Blinken said Rafah \u201cwill be opened\u201d so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave.\n\nBut there was confusion over the agreement and the crossing remained closed, deepening frustration and panic among aid groups, who warn that time is running out for wounded and displaced Gazans to receive critical \u2014 and, in many cases, lifesaving \u2014 supplies.\n\nThe planned trip to Israel is in some ways reminiscent of Biden\u2019s visit in February to Kyiv, as he was seeking to dramatically show his support for Ukraine. That trip, too, was aimed at showcasing Biden\u2019s personal support for an ally that had suffered a bloody attack, in Ukraine\u2019s case at the hands of Russia. That visit was kept secret until Biden\u2019s arrival."

    "description": "As Gazans flee, Israel\u2019s military leadership readies a broad offensive. But experts in urban warfare warn that the terrain is troublesome and the endgame uncertain.",
    "content": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that \u201cevery Hamas fighter\u201d will be \u201cdestroyed,\u201d while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to go back in, heavy, and it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,\u201d said Kenneth \u201cFrank\u201d McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be \u201cdragged out over a much longer period of time\u201d than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities \u2014 including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people \u2014 have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would \u201cend\u201d the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an \u201cintegrated and coordinated attack\u201d by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel\u2019s offensive is \u201cobviously going to be much larger\u201d now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be \u201cexponentially greater\u201d than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in \u201cdog fights\u201d between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has \u201cbecome very efficient\u201d at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces\u2019 advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas\u2019s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn\u2019t sustainable.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to go into Gaza again. They didn\u2019t want to occupy it. They didn\u2019t want to be responsible for administrating it,\u201d Misztal said. \u201cBut now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?\u201d\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel \u201cat this time\u201d \u2014 but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power."

    "description": "Biden walks a fine line as he tries to balance unwavering support for Israel with concern for conditions in Gaza",
    "content": "Democrats have been almost entirely unified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas hunted civilians in their homes and cars, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages, including some Americans, into Gaza. The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.\n\nBiden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel\u2019s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians. On Sunday he named a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, and the White House has begun emphasizing its work to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow through Gaza and that Palestinian civilians can flee areas Israel is targeting.\n\nThis is not the first time Biden\u2019s ironclad support of Israel has put him at odds with the more liberal wing of his party, as Democrats have grown increasingly willing to challenge Israel as its government has become more right-wing. Some Democrats have raised concerns or outright opposition to U. S. military support to Israel, pointing to its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank and its years-long punishing blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also formed the most far-right government in Israel\u2019s history, though that has been replaced since the attacks by a unity government that includes centrist parties.\n\nBiden has said Israel has a duty to respond to the attacks, which he has called as consequential as the Holocaust, but he seemed to impose limits when he said during a television interview airing Sunday that Israel reoccupying Gaza would be \u201ca big mistake.\u201d Israel captured the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war, but it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, leading to a Hamas takeover of the territory two years later.\n\nA White House summary of Biden\u2019s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U. S. coordination with the United Nations, as well as Egypt, Jordan, Israel and other countries to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. \u201cPresident Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,\u201d the readout said.\n\nBiden and his top aides are focused on preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflagration and have repeatedly warned other actors, such as Iran, not to get involved. They are also concerned that anger in Arab countries whose citizens are highly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause could set off such a conflict, according to a senior administration official, who  spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.\n\n\u201cThey know an Israeli ground incursion that has really high casualties could inflame not just the situation among Palestinians but in the broader region,\u201d said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a genuine concern that the threat of Hamas needs to be eliminated \u2026 but at the same time, how do you make sure that innocent Palestinians aren\u2019t targeted?\u201d\n\n\u201cJ Street adamantly rejects the charge that it threatened endorsees,\u201d said the organization\u2019s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. \u201cOver the past 10 days, we\u2019ve spoken to many members of Congress to explain why support for Israel, condemnation of Hamas and recognition of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself are core values of the organization. We want those we support to hear how important it is to us that our partners stand up for Israel even as we also speak out on the crisis now facing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe conflict has inflamed tensions in more direct ways as well. Capitol Police last week had a meeting with nine progressive Democrats, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush, about their safety. A Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said the lawmakers are receiving significantly more threats than they have in the past. The meeting was put together by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N. Y.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.)."

    "description": "The link between Egypt and Gaza is the only route for aid convoys to enter and foreign citizens to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave.",
    "content": "It has also provided the only route for aid convoys to enter the Palestinian territory. Since the first aid delivery reached Gaza nearly two weeks ago, trucks have brought in medicine, food and a limited supply of drinking water. But humanitarian officials warn the aid is nowhere near enough for the more than 2 million Gaza residents in peril, with dwindling supplies and no way to flee.\n\nThe crossing between the southern edge of the Gaza Strip and Egypt\u2019s northern Sinai region is the only link from Gaza that Israel does not control. Palestinians in Gaza have lived under a 16-year blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control of the coastal enclave.\n\nPeople and goods were able to cross through the Rafah border with Egypt for some days after Hamas militants launched the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault on Israel that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Rafah stopped operating on Oct. 10, when retaliatory Israeli strikes damaged the crossing.\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombing of Gaza has since wounded and killed thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces expand a ground assault on the densely populated enclave. Israel has also cut off  electricity to Gaza and blocked fuel from being sent in with the aid trucks.\n\nThe latest movements of foreign nationals and aid at Rafah remains woefully insufficient for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians who remain trapped in the enclave far past the point of desperation, aid workers said. A few dozen aid trucks have entered Gaza at a time, compared with hundreds that rolled in daily from various points before this war.\n\nAs drinking water dwindles in Gaza, the United Nations has sounded the alarm about the potential for disease to spread. Hospitals are overcrowded and running out of fuel and supplies. Israel\u2019s calls for residents of northern Gaza to head south have worsened the crisis, according to aid workers. The United Nations has warned that forcible evacuation could contravene international law.\n\nEgypt, which has its own political and security concerns, is determined to avoid an exodus of Palestinian refugees. The government is concerned about security in its Sinai region and wants to avoid being seen as complicit in a campaign that could force Palestinians out of Gaza for good.\n\nAfter President Biden visited Israel in a show of solidarity in October, he said Egypt would open the crossing for aid deliveries, announcing that a deal was struck with Israel to allow aid trucks through Rafah into Gaza.\n\nThe passage of some foreign citizens this week came after negotiations involving Hamas and the U. S., Egyptian and Israeli governments, which all traded public recriminations over who was to blame for the previous deadlock. The deal that opened the crossing for evacuations was mediated by Qatar, a person familiar with the agreement said.\n\nThose border negotiations have focused largely on aid deliveries and the exit of foreign citizens, as well as the release of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas militants. Previous deals, involving the departure of foreign nationals, have fallen through at the last minute.\n\nWhile U. S. officials have primarily blamed Hamas for the stalemate, they have also alluded to the complexity of talks involving many parties, each with their own interests. Egypt has blamed Israel for not providing guarantees that it will not bomb the crossing or its vicinity if people try to leave.\n\nIsrael has said it will not allow aid in through its own borders with Gaza but will not stop deliveries from Egypt \u2014 on the conditions they are limited to \u201cfood, water and medicine for the civilian population\u201d and do not reach Hamas."

    "description": "The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was also struck Saturday and had braced to be a key support in the war.",
    "content": "The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City \u2014 where authorities suspect an airstrike killed hundreds of people Tuesday \u2014 is owned and operated by a branch of the Anglican Communion, one of the largest Christian groups in the world. The 80-bed hospital normally sees about 3,500 outpatient visits a month, according to the website of the Diocese of Jerusalem, the local branch of the Anglican Communion that runs al-Ahli. It handles about 300 surgeries and roughly 600 radiological visits a month.\n\nEileen Spencer, head of the American fundraising arm for the diocese, told The Washington Post that after the strike Tuesday, \u201cwe don\u2019t know if the hospital will still be standing.\u201d\n\nAl-Ahli is Gaza\u2019s only independent, Christian-led medical facility, Spencer said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what the point of all this is. There are so many casualties, and it seems like it is just going to get worse.\u201d\n\nTuesday had been a day of fasting and prayer for peace in the Holy Land, called for by Pope Francis, the Anglican Communion and other Christian denominations. After the hospital strike, the Diocese of Jerusalem called for a day of mourning Wednesday.\n\nIn a written statement, the diocese said, \u201cThe devastation witnessed, coupled with the sacrilegious targeting of the church, strikes at the very core of human decency. We assert unequivocally that this is deserving international condemnation and retribution. An urgent appeal resonates for the international community to fulfil its duty in protecting civilians and ensuring that such inhumane horrific acts are not replicated.\u201d\n\nThe hospital was founded in 1882, according to the Jerusalem diocese\u2019s website. It runs a free program for breast cancer detection and provides free medical care and food to people in nearby towns and villages.\n\nOn Oct. 8, in the hours after the Hamas attack on Israel, the hospital launched a fundraising appeal, saying it was urgent to get medicine and other supplies for emergencies that the staff predicted would come.\n\n\u201cThe situation is severely critical, and the consequences for people in Gaza are very bad, particularly in the health sector. The Ministry of Health has triggered an emergency situation and asked all health-service providers to increase their emergency response capacity. Life in Gaza is paralyzed, with all institutions and private sectors closed, affecting the people\u2019s access to basic needs, particularly health,\u201d hospital director Suhaila Tarazi wrote in the appeal. \u201cAAH is committed to continuing to provide 24/7 health services for all people in need of medical care.\u201d\n\nAn Israeli rocket hit al-Ahli on Saturday, according to the Anglican Communion\u2019s news service. It landed on the cancer treatment center, severely damaging two floors where the ultrasound and mammography wards are. Four hospital staff were injured.\n\n\u201cThe Diagnostic Centre is the Crown Jewel of Ahli Hospital, providing cancer diagnosis as a prelude to various treatment options both at Ahli and in other facilities,\u201d the Anglican archbishop of Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum, said in a story about the Saturday strike. The hospital was due to open a new chemotherapy center there next month, Naoum said.\n\nHundreds are believed dead after what Palestinian officials say was an Israeli airstrike Tuesday on the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter. The Israel Defense Forces blamed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying \u201ca barrage of rockets\u201d was passing near the hospital when it was hit.\n\nViolence and protests broke out in many Arab cities following the hospital strike, and within hours, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister said his country would not host a summit that had been planned for Wednesday with President Biden, Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n\u201cWe grieve at the continuing loss of innocent lives. The latest news from Gaza is distressing and comes on top of what has been an appalling 10 days for Israelis and Palestinians alike,\u201d Gavin Drake wrote to The Post. \u201cAt the moment, we are monitoring the situation closely and continuing to gather information in this fast moving situation.\u201d\n\nPresiding Bishop Michael Curry, leader of the Episcopal Church, which is the U. S. branch of the Anglican Communion, said in a statement Tuesday that he had visited the hospital in 2018 and saw how \u201cthey were passionately committed to anyone who had need.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask you to pray fervently for the birthplace of the Abrahamic faiths and for all its people. Pray for those who have been hurt, harmed, or killed \u2014 regardless of who they are or who did it,\u201d he continued. \u201cPray also for the leaders and people of the entire region, that they will find the way to a just peace where all may live in safety and security as God intends.\u201d"

    "description": "Mounting Middle Eastern anger overshadowed President Biden\u2019s visit to Israel, at least temporarily disrupting U.S. efforts to de-escalate regional tensions.",
    "content": "Biden announced that a deal had been struck with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to flow from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million people face relentless airstrikes and an Israeli siege. Supplies of food, drinking water and fuel are dwindling by the hour. Despite the apparent breakthrough, Biden said the aid would not start arriving until Friday at the earliest.\n\nConcerned that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a broader regional conflict, the White House has tried to assure Arab partners that it will use its influence to protect innocent Gazans. Conditions in the enclave \u2014 already one of the poorest and most densely populated places in the world \u2014 are deteriorating rapidly. More than 3,000 people have been killed by airstrikes. Local hospitals are collapsing.\n\nBiden spent a little over seven hours in Israel, where he was greeted on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two men \u2014 whose decades-long relationship has been tested this year \u2014 shared a brief hug. Biden spent more than two hours at a meeting of the Israeli war cabinet before speaking with survivors of the attacks and families of victims and hostages.\n\nNetanyahu emphasized Wednesday that Israel would not permit the transfer of any humanitarian aid to Gaza from its own territory, but said it would not thwart the delivery of supplies from Egypt, provided it was limited to \u201cfood, water and medicine for the civilian population\u201d \u2014 and so long as none of it reached Hamas.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday called on residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the town of al-Mawasi, the latest in a series of recent directives urging Gazans to move south, even though most have nowhere to stay. The United Nations has warned that the evacuation orders may violate international law.\n\nThere was little acknowledgment in the region of Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility for the hospital strike, or of Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalizing ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d"

    "description": "For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state.",
    "content": "These and other incidents have rattled Jewish communities on campuses across America as they mourn victims of the Oct. 7 massacres and kidnappings. For decades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has stoked passions and divisions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state. But the outbreak of war has elevated those tensions even further in recent days and raised new alarms about intimidation and antisemitism on campus.\n\nColleges and universities usually take pride in hosting demonstrations and debate, as long as no one gets hurt. Fiery rhetoric is tolerated and often encouraged as students and faculty members engage on politics, the climate, the economy, racism and war. But Jewish leaders say that too often debates over the Middle East take a problematic turn, leading to a threatening atmosphere for Jewish students. For them, that phenomenon is not new.\n\n\u201cThe campus climate for Jewish students has been degrading over several years, and that has been aggravated by broader increases in antisemitism and virulent demonization of Israel on campuses,\u201d Adam Lehman, president and chief executive of the Jewish organization Hillel International, said in an interview. Lehman said the climate in recent days has worsened.\n\nAfter the surprise Hamas attack that left more than 1,400 people dead in Israel and thousands more wounded, the Georgia Tech chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi hung a banner from a balcony that declared solidarity with Israel. On Saturday, its members found the pro-Palestinian message written in shaving cream underneath the banner. The message was washed off, but it left a deeper impression: Their home, the fraternity members felt, had been violated.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the defacing of our property that was committed last weekend,\u201d the chapter said in a statement. \u201cAs a Jewish fraternity, we have all been deeply affected by the current events in Israel, and we are profoundly disheartened to see that this conflict has allowed antisemitism to gain a foothold on our campus. With our fellow Jews under attack in Israel, we feel that it is important to visibly display our support for the Israeli people as Jewish leaders at Georgia Tech.\u201d\n\nAt Stanford, the Jewish news organization the Forward reported last week, an instructor had asked Jewish and Israeli students in a class to identify themselves, take their belongings and stand in a corner. The apparent point of the exercise, according to the article, was to show students how the instructor believed Israel treats the Palestinians.\n\nUniversity leaders acknowledged in an Oct. 11 statement that they had received a report of a class in which an instructor \u201caddressed the Middle East conflict in a manner that called out individual students in class based on their backgrounds and identities.\u201d Stanford President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez said the instructor, who was not identified, \u201cis not currently teaching\u201d while the university in California investigates. \u201cWithout prejudging the matter, this report is a cause for serious concern,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAt Tufts University in Massachusetts, Micah Gritz, 21, a senior from Rockville, Md., who is a leader in a group called Jewish on Campus, said he was horrified to read an email in which a campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine used paraglider emojis to advertise a rally in nearby Cambridge. The email also praised \u201cliberation fighters\u201d \u2014 an allusion to Hamas militants \u2014 who had used paragliders in the cross-border attack and showed \u201ccreativity necessary to take back stolen land.\u201d\n\nCornell was roiled after an associate professor of history, Russell Rickford, spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in Ithaca, N. Y. The Cornell Daily Sun, a student newspaper, and others published video of his remarks. In the speech, Rickford cited \u201cmany Gazans of goodwill, many Palestinians of conscience, who abhor violence \u2014 as do you, as do I.\u201d But he also said many who support the Palestinian cause had strong feelings after learning of the Oct. 7 attack.\n\n\u201cIt was exhilarating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was energizing. And if they weren\u2019t exhilarated by this challenge to the monopoly of violence, by this shifting of the balance of power, then they would not be human. I was exhilarated.\u201d\n\nBut he told the Cornell Daily Sun that he believed the Hamas attack signaled that \u201cthe Palestinian will to resist had not been broken.\u201d He acknowledged that in subsequent days, \u201cwe learned of some of the horrifying realities.\u201d\n\nMartha E. Pollack, Cornell\u2019s president, and Kraig H. Kayser, chairman of the university\u2019s board of trustees, rebuked Rickford in a statement Tuesday and said the university was reviewing the matter. Faculty members at universities, especially those with tenure protections, are often given significant leeway in matters of free speech and academic freedom."

    "description": "Tensions over bloodshed in the Middle East have Palestinian Americans increasingly anxious about the violence they may face here.",
    "content": "The Palestinian boy who had been knifed to death on Saturday was 6 \u2014 the same age as her son \u2014 so Fidaa Elaydi imposed a new rule: No more playing outside. She used to feel safe in Bridgeview, a Chicago suburb full of Middle Eastern eateries and Muslim clothing boutiques that was known as Little Palestine. Then the Palestinian militant group Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history.\n\nIn the 10 days since the rampage by Hamas fighters and Israel\u2019s full-scale counterstrike targeting the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, a spate of headlines has validated her fears. In Boston, somebody spray-painted \u201cNazis\u201d on a sign for a Palestinian cultural center. In Dearborn, Mich., police arrested a man who allegedly urged his Facebook friends to \u201chunt Palestinians.\u201d And barely 25 miles from Elaydi\u2019s house, a landlord is accused of stabbing his tenants, gravely wounding the mother and killing her son, with authorities linking his assault \u201cto them being Muslims and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.\u201d\n\nPalestinians in the United States, half a world away from the carnage in the Middle East, say they are canceling dinners out, taking time off work and staying home. Some are getting ominous emails and messages on social media. Others say the environment seems so charged, they\u2019re afraid to openly express concern for loved ones trapped in Gaza as Israel pushes to eradicate the militants responsible for the Oct. 7 massacre of soldiers and civilians.\n\nAnguish for family members in Gaza only heightened the anxiety after a strike Tuesday set a hospital ablaze. Palestinian and Israeli officials traded blame for the attack. The only certainty: Hundreds may have been killed, adding to the death toll of about 3,000 Palestinians.\n\nThose who argue for a Palestinian state, a decades-old cause, say they are being framed as cheerleading \u201cHamas\u2019s genocidal war,\u201d as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) phrased it in a letter to the Justice Department. Hawley called for an investigation of student groups organizing pro-Palestinian rallies.\n\nThe bloodshed overseas is sowing panic in communities across the country, with the FBI saying it is tracking a spike in threats against both Muslim and Jewish Americans. The agency warned that bad actors could \u201cexploit the conflict\u201d and provoke violence \u201con our own soil.\u201d Mosques and synagogues have beefed up security. Some private Jewish day schools shuttered last week after a former Hamas leader called for a \u201cday of jihad.\u201d\n\nHundreds of Arab Americans gathered at a mosque in Bridgeview on Monday for the funeral of the 6-year-old boy, Wadea Alfayoumi, who had been stabbed 26 times, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Outside, speakers called on lawmakers to address the conflict with context and nuance. Some demanded an apology from President Biden, whom they accused of inflaming tensions with his comment about seeing photos of Hamas fighters beheading children \u2014 a claim the White House later walked back.\n\nOne attended a pro-Palestinian rally on campus last week where strangers started filming the students, Othman said, and she advised her to not engage with anyone who seemed hostile. She doesn\u2019t want her daughters to limit their freedom of speech, though.\n\nRanda Mohammad, a student-support coordinator at a middle school in Dearborn, is following the news with a growing sense of dread. Five of her relatives \u2014 her sister-in-law\u2019s cousins \u2014 were killed in Gaza while trying to help civilians who had been ordered to evacuate, she said. When videos of the hospital attack reached her phone, she hid in the garage so her children wouldn\u2019t see her cry.\n\nMore than half of Dearborn\u2019s residents are Arab American. Familial ties to Gaza and the West Bank run deep. People love to snack on flaky, cheese-layered kunafa at the beloved Palestinian bakery. And, Mohammad said, everyone is on edge.\n\nThe police presence outside her school has been heavier than normal, she noted; officers arrested a 41-year-old man last week who had posted on social media about hunting Palestinians. On Monday, a 12-year-old student came to her with a question.\n\nThe Arab American Political Action Committee canceled a banquet scheduled for Wednesday in Dearborn, accusing American leaders of endorsing bloodshed by not \u201cdoing the bare minimum of calling for a cease fire.\u201d The organizers also harbored security concerns, according to Osama Siblani, a Lebanese journalist on the board of directors. Palestinians as a group, he said, are too often portrayed as the enemy."

    "description": "During a contentious confirmation hearing, Jack Lew sought to fend off GOP attacks on his past defense of the Iran nuclear deal and related policies.",
    "content": "At times contentious, Lew\u2019s hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee coincided with a dramatic appearance in Israel by Biden as furor grips the Middle East and protests over the mounting death toll among Palestinians, who have faced days of Israeli bombardment, spread across the region. The proceedings in Washington centered on what lawmakers overwhelmingly agreed is Israel\u2019s need for a steadfast American ally in the wake of this month\u2019s devastating Hamas attack, though many Republicans signaled it would be difficult for them to support Lew given his past work to implement the now-defunct deal with Israel\u2019s sworn enemy.\n\nOther Republicans on the committee, including Sens. Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) and Mitt Romney (Utah) suggested that the relaxation of sanctions under the nuclear deal allowed Tehran to more seriously fund militant groups such as Hamas. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) accused Lew of misleading the committee in his past testimony and alleged that the Obama administration sought to provide Iran access to U. S. banks.\n\n\u201cWe negotiated with Iran to have them roll back their nuclear program, in exchange for which they would get access to money that was their money that we had frozen. All we did was facilitate that transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cMy team went around the world, telling banks: \u2018... We did not lift the sanctions on terrorism. We did not lift the sanctions on human rights violations. We did not lift the sanctions on regional destabilization. Be careful.\u2019 And Iran thought that kept them from getting what they thought they should get.\u201d\n\nThe landmark nuclear deal restricted Iran\u2019s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the loosening of U. S. sanctions. Obama argued then that the agreement was intended to set back any effort by Tehran to build nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement after taking office, and Iran has since exceeded the deal\u2019s limits on the quantity and quality of its enriched uranium production.\n\nAt the time of the 2015 negotiations, Lew defended the deal publicly to pro-Israel audiences in the United States, where he was once heckled. And because the Treasury Department is charged with implementing sanctions policies, he presided over the loosening of restrictions on Iran. The deal unlocked foreign investment in Iran and eased financing for the government. Backers encouraged that investment as part of ensuring that the agreement functioned as it was envisioned.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to distinguish between the technical details to facilitate implementation of the [Iran nuclear agreement] and more broadly welcoming Iran into the U. S. financial community. We didn\u2019t. And I took no actions that would do that,\u201d Lew said in response to Rubio\u2019s assertions. The senator\u2019s account, he added, was at odds with \u201cmy memory of what I had people out there doing.\u201d\n\nLew, 68, who even before his term as treasury secretary served in the top echelon of the Obama and Clinton presidencies, is an unusually senior appointment for the role. He was Obama\u2019s chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role he also filled for President Bill Clinton, when the federal government last ran a budget surplus. Under Obama, he was also a deputy secretary of state.\n\nWhile several Democrats raised concerns during the hearing about the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where a humanitarian crisis is rapidly unfolding as Israeli forces wage a ferocious response to the Hamas attack, Republicans asked whether Lew was sufficiently supportive of Israel and if he shared their desire for a more hawkish approach to Middle East peace.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for us to be lecturing Israel on what they have to do to establish the security that they have a responsibility to provide,\u201d Lew said. \u201cI think they know they have to do it in a way that is consistent with minimizing the impact on innocent civilians,\u201d he added. But previous U. S. wars have demonstrated that \u201cit is very, very hard for there not to be collateral damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all aware that Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who went on to ask, \u201cWill you, if you are confirmed, work with Israel to make sure that schools and hospitals and power and water systems are not targeted?\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), broached the spread of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying the seizure of \u201cmore and more Palestinian lands\u201d was potentially undermining efforts to broker peace and, in turn, strengthening Hamas. He asked Lew whether the Biden administration\u2019s pursuit of a deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia would need some \u201cattention paid to the Palestinian issues\u201d if it is to succeed.\n\nNow is \u201cprobably not the right time\u201d to address whether Palestinian grievances should be a part of any deal between the Israelis and Saudis, Lew responded. \u201cBut after this war is over, it has to be part of the conversation.\u201d"

    "description": "The strike on the hospital came as President Biden was set to visit the region and humanitarian aid for Gaza remained stranded on the Egyptian border.",
    "content": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden\u2019s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country\u2019s worst crisis in decades.\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza\u2019s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n\u201cWe all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,\u201d Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. \u201cThey go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?\u201d\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid."

    "description": "Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza poses a growing dilemma for the Biden administration.",
    "content": "Palestinian authorities said at least 500 people were killed in a strike on a crowded hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, adding a dramatic escalation to a death toll that already stood above 2,000 since Israeli forces began pounding the densely populated area with airstrikes following Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 assault. As many as 1 million people were ordered to flee south as bombardment reduces much of northern Gaza to rubble and conditions deteriorate following Israel\u2019s suspension of water and electricity to the Hamas-ruled enclave, posing an additional test for Biden as he flies to the Middle East.\n\nBiden, in a statement issued as he travels to Israel, said he was \u201coutraged\u201d by the hospital explosion. The United States, he said, \u201cstands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict.\u201d In turn, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas canceled his planned meeting with Biden, and a summit that was to include Biden and the leaders of Egypt and Jordan also was called off.\n\nBiden himself, a longtime supporter of Israel who has issued an emotional condemnation of Hamas\u2019s \u201cact of sheer evil,\u201d has pledged unqualified support for Israel\u2019s goal of obliterating the group. But the president and his aides, facing pressure from within the Democratic Party to curb the violence, also are warning Israel against reoccupying Gaza and saying they expect Israel to adhere to the laws of war.\n\n\u201cYou have an administration that has made very public commitments to improve how it addresses civilian harm, including with partners,\u201d said Annie Shiel, U. S. advocacy director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. \u201cAnd if the U.S. isn\u2019t going to be firm with Israel about civilian harm and its obligations, then those commitments seem like they go out the window.\u201d\n\nLegal experts said that expanding U. S. military support for Israel meanwhile carries with it weighty considerations for the United States as reported Palestinian casualties mount. Already the administration has positioned two aircraft carriers in the eastern Mediterranean, dispatched an amphibious task force to the area, and expedited shipments of munitions and air defense missiles. How Israel employs U.S.-origin weapons, experts said, may now have new implications for the United States.\n\nBrian Finucane, who served as a State Department attorney during the Obama administration, said the considerations include domestic laws governing arms sales specifying that U. S. weapons can be sold to other countries for the goal of \u201clegitimate self-defense\u201d and international laws that could, in theory, implicate a donor of military aid to a nation that then goes on to violate the laws of war with those arms.\n\nDespite a bargaining session between Blinken and Israel\u2019s war cabinet that went for more than seven hours from Monday evening into the early hours of Tuesday morning, the two sides were only able to agree \u201cto develop a plan\u201d that will include the \u201cpossibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Blinken said after emerging from the meeting."

    "description": "The U.S. president heads into an area subject to rocket and bomb attacks, though experts say he will be heavily protected.",
    "content": "Adding to the risks of Biden\u2019s trip was a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that killed at least 500 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital courtyard where displaced Gazans were taking shelter, while the Israel Defense Forces blamed an errant rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, saying \u201ca barrage of rockets\u201d was passing near the hospital when it was hit.\n\nThe hospital blast has set off fierce protests in the Middle East, including in Jordan, where the Israeli Embassy was surrounded by protesters Tuesday evening. A planned visit by Biden to Amman on Wednesday was canceled after the strike, forcing the U. S. president to forgo a scheduled meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nSome security experts said the physical risk to Biden would be relatively small despite the chaos in the region. Biden is one of the most protected people on the planet, they said, and Air Force One is equipped with sophisticated air defense systems that can thwart incoming rockets and missiles.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a rarity for a president to travel directly into a region where hostilities are intensifying, with an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza expected within days and fears that the militant group Hezbollah might enter the fray. Biden faces at least some risk when he is on the ground in Tel Aviv, a city Hamas rockets are able to reach. In Amman, which Biden had planned to visit after his stop in Tel Aviv, the situation remains combustible.\n\n\u201cBeing in an active area of hostilities, they have to look very carefully at the threats that Israel is facing now, understanding that the president will be on the ground,\u201d said Jonathan Lord, senior fellow and director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cSo they\u2019re definitely thinking about Israel\u2019s air defense capabilities and protecting the president from Hamas rockets.\u201d\n\nThe crisis erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants broke through Israel\u2019s sophisticated border fence with Gaza and hunted Israeli civilians in their cars and homes, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages into Gaza, including some Americans. Tensions have only grown since then as the brutality and scope of Hamas\u2019s attacks have become clearer and as Israel has launched repeated deadly airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nBiden\u2019s visit comes as Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion that it says is an effort to destroy Hamas, potentially setting off one of the worst conflicts in the region in decades. U. S. officials are deeply concerned that the war could spread and draw in such actors as Hezbollah or Iran.\n\nGaza is a densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. Even without a formal occupation, Israel controls almost all aspects of life in the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, water, electricity and fuel \u2014 tactics that human rights groups have said violate international law.\n\nThe country has also unleashed an unrelenting bombardment campaign and warned more than 1 million Palestinians to flee northern Gaza to avoid being in harm\u2019s way, an order that the United Nations called impossible. Biden and his top aides have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors so that Palestinian civilians can flee and aid can get into the Palestinian territory.\n\nExperts said Biden\u2019s trip to Kyiv this year was in some ways more dangerous than the Israel trip because Russia has a far more sophisticated military than Hamas. Although Hamas is arguably a far more unpredictable entity, its militants are unlikely to have the technology or prowess to launch a targeted attack against an American president.\n\n\u201cThe risk to the president himself is probably pretty minimal. He is surrounded by Secret Service and the Israelis will provide additional protection layers,\u201d Riedel said. He added that Biden flying in and out of the Middle East in one day, rather than staying in an easily identifiable location overnight, further minimizes the risks."

Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.In conversations with congressional staffers, Biden aides have discussed proposing as soon as this week a major foreign policy package amid numerous international crises, including the war between Hamas and Israel. The legislation is also expected to include substantial funds to bolster U.S. immigration enforcement at the southern border with Mexico, and may include funds for Taiwan to deter aggression from China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations. Money to respond to recent U.S. natural disasters, including wildfires in Maui and various hurricanes, could also be folded into the legislation.\n\nAides stressed that the plans were highly uncertain and subject to change. President Biden previously proposed roughly $20.4 billion in funding for Ukraine, but Congress blocked any additional money for Ukraine when it extended government funding into November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make a strong statement to our enemies and to our friends,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said about the proposed aid package.\n\nOne person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said the request would cover a full fiscal year for the crises it is intended to address.\n\nDemocratic leaders said they expect to receive the proposal at the end of this week.\n\n\u201cWe intend to get the package at the end of this week and it will include the military help Israel needs, the diplomatic and intelligence help Israel needs, as well as humanitarian aid to minimize the loss of innocent human life, of Palestinians and of Israelis,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) told reporters.\n\nThe effort comes as House Republicans struggle to elect a new speaker, which could complicate efforts to pass any bill swiftly. House Republicans have grown increasingly wary of providing taxpayer funds to Kyiv, but may be more likely to do so if a request also includes money for the border and Israel.\n\nBloomberg reported earlier that White House officials were considering a $100 billion request in the aid package. It was unclear how much money would be included for each country."

    "content": "White House officials are considering asking Congress for an aid package primarily aimed at supporting Ukraine and Israel that could cost as much as $100 billion, although that preliminary estimate may change as planning remains in flux, according to four people briefed on the matter. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.In conversations with congressional staffers, Biden aides have discussed proposing as soon as this week a major foreign policy package amid numerous international crises, including the war between Hamas and Israel. The legislation is also expected to include substantial funds to bolster U.S. immigration enforcement at the southern border with Mexico, and may include funds for Taiwan to deter aggression from China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations. Money to respond to recent U.S. natural disasters, including wildfires in Maui and various hurricanes, could also be folded into the legislation.\n\nAides stressed that the plans were highly uncertain and subject to change. President Biden previously proposed roughly $20.4 billion in funding for Ukraine, but Congress blocked any additional money for Ukraine when it extended government funding into November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make a strong statement to our enemies and to our friends,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S. C.) said about the proposed aid package.\n\nOne person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said the request would cover a full fiscal year for the crises it is intended to address.\n\nDemocratic leaders said they expect to receive the proposal at the end of this week.\n\n\u201cWe intend to get the package at the end of this week and it will include the military help Israel needs, the diplomatic and intelligence help Israel needs, as well as humanitarian aid to minimize the loss of innocent human life, of Palestinians and of Israelis,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) told reporters.\n\nThe effort comes as House Republicans struggle to elect a new speaker, which could complicate efforts to pass any bill swiftly. House Republicans have grown increasingly wary of providing taxpayer funds to Kyiv, but may be more likely to do so if a request also includes money for the border and Israel.\n\nBloomberg reported earlier that White House officials were considering a $100 billion request in the aid package. It was unclear how much money would be included for each country."

    "description": "From Steve Bannon to Sean Hannity, right-wing media stars have had enormous influence over Republicans\u2019 search for a leader.",
    "content": "But the widely watched conservative pundit wasn\u2019t only using his televised bully pulpit to pressure the holdouts. Hannity also spent the weekend personally calling several and having one of his producers reach out to others to lobby them on their vote. He also took to social media to encourage his followers to call wavering members and demand they fall into line.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, when Jordan lost an initial vote of the full House, it was unclear whether the turbulent series of events would end with a congressman long relegated to the hard-right fringe elevated to lead the chamber. But the overall picture of the legislative branch in chaos \u2014 and the allure of the media spotlight helping to drive the dysfunction \u2014 was well-established.\n\nThen House Republicans\u2019 original preferred replacement \u2014 Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) \u2014 had to withdraw from contention after failing to consolidate the support of hard-right members and the media figures who back them. Now Hannity and others are leaning on Jordan\u2019s critics to get behind the Ohio congressman, who has long been a favorite of Fox News and other conservative outlets.\n\nThe campaign by Hannity to boost Jordan, who has also been endorsed for the speaker\u2019s job by former president Donald Trump, began soon after Scalise withdrew from the race. On Friday afternoon, Hannity tweeted that \u201cAny Member of Congress would be crazy to NOT support Jim Jordan for Speaker. He is a natural born principled leader who will lead house Republicans to unite vs the radical left.\u201d Hannity went on to provide the switchboard number for the House of Representatives, and urged his followers to \u201ccall your member and tell them.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Hannity reached out to several holdout lawmakers who were not supporting Jordan, while one of his producers contacted lawmakers with an email asking why they weren\u2019t backing him. The producer\u2019s email, which was first reported by Axios and has been confirmed by The Washington Post, included a leading question: \u201cHannity would like to know why during a war breaking out between Israel and Hamas, with a war in Ukraine, with the wide open borders, with a budget that\u2019s unfinished why would Rep xxx be against Rep Jim Jordan for speaker?\u201d\n\nBut in a measure of the limits of those kinds of pressure tactics, Womack on Tuesday was among the 20 Republicans who declined to support Jordan in the floor vote. Womack, who voted for Scalise instead, said the GOP\u2019s initial nominee had been \u201ckneecapped\u201d before he could get his own vote before the full House.\n\nSome members have been unusually outspoken in blasting their colleagues for playing to the cameras. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) tweeted last week that his fellow members were making decisions based on \u201cegos and TV time.\u201d McCarthy, meanwhile, was unequivocal in identifying what he saw as the reasons Gaetz had moved against him. \u201cIt had nothing to do about spending,\u201d he told reporters shortly after his ouster. \u201cIt all was about getting attention from you.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the speaker fight, the consequence has been a string of firsts that hint at the underlying chaos: the first 15-round speaker election in nearly two centuries when McCarthy was chosen in January; the first ouster of a speaker by a vote of the House when he was deposed this month; and the first vacancy in over half a century to last two weeks or more.\n\nPrevious Republican speakers have had tortured tenures as they have attempted to govern in the face of factions trying to wield outsize power by leveraging their influence on the airwaves. For instance, unlike McCarthy, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) wasn\u2019t voted out of office. But he did step aside under pressure in 2015 after the Freedom Caucus, led in part by Jordan and backed by Fox, made the Republican conference ungovernable.\n\nBut once in power, McCarthy had to make deals with Democrats to keep the government functioning. The cycle eventually caught up with him, as it is likely to do with anyone in his position, even a Fox News regular like Jordan, Stirewalt said.\n\n\u201cJim Jordan used Fox News and the right-of-center media to great effect over the past decade to force his way into the conference, to force his way into leadership and create all these pressure points,\u201d Stirewalt said. \u201cSo after this long struggle, you hear people saying, \u2018We have to stop here. The revolution has to stop here.\u2019 But I don\u2019t see why anyone feels like they have to go along now and behave themselves.\u201d"

    "description": "A top secret intelligence document from February 2023 said longtime enemies Hezbollah and Israel had settled into a posture of \u201cmutual deterrence.\u201d",
    "content": "According to a top-secret U. S. intelligence document, however, a massive attack by Hezbollah, the political party and militant group backed by Iran, would be unlikely. As of early this year, U.S. intelligence analysts saw a predictable if still violent balance between Israel and Hezbollah diminishing the risk of a full-scale war in 2023.\n\nAccording to an analysis prepared in February by the intelligence directorate for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Israel and Hezbollah had settled into a posture of \u201cmutual deterrence\u201d since the conclusion of a historic agreement, in October 2022, in which Lebanon and Israel agreed to demarcate their contested maritime borders. The deal, 11 years in the making, signified a breakthrough and allowed each country to finally explore the lucrative gas fields off their coasts.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah had taken steps to \u201cmaintain readiness\u201d to use force, but had remained \u201cwithin their historical patterns of engagement,\u201d which meant avoiding casualties and responding to provocations in a proportional way, according to the U. S. briefing document, which The Washington Post obtained exclusively after it was shared on the chat platform Discord.\n\nHezbollah is Lebanon\u2019s strongest armed group and political party. Along with its allies, it held the majority in parliament until elections in 2022 when it fell short a few seats. The coalition still maintained the largest number of seats in parliament.\n\nAs Lebanon falls deeper into an economic crisis, and in the absence of state institutions and benefits, Hezbollah has attempted to buttress its position as an alternative patron for much of the country\u2019s historically marginalized Shiite community.\n\n\u201cEven during periods of heightened tensions,\u201d Israel and Hezbollah had intended \u201cto display strength while avoiding escalation,\u201d according to the U. S. analysis. For example, the document explains, Israel might carry out sabotage operations in Lebanon or fire on empty land, while Hezbollah shoots down an Israeli drone or fires rockets into the northern part of the country. The actions are provocative, but they are designed to avoid casualties. Each side can demonstrate to the other that they\u2019re on guard and capable of striking without igniting a wider outbreak of hostilities.\n\nIn April, 34 rockets were launched from southern Lebanon into Israel, an attack that the Israeli military said was carried out by Hamas operatives, whose leaders had met with the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, a day earlier in Lebanon. For months, the U. S. analysis noted, \u201cIsrael perceived a high risk of miscalculation due to Lebanon-based HAMAS plots.\u201d Essentially, while Hezbollah might not be courting a war with Israel, that outcome was not entirely within its control, the U.S. intelligence suggested.\n\nThe State Department estimates that Hezbollah claims tens of thousands of members and supporters worldwide and receives hundreds of millions of dollars in annual support from Iran. Experts have described Hezbollah as the world\u2019s most heavily armed non-state actor. According to public Israeli sources, Hezbollah has expanded its arsenal of rockets and missiles from around 15,000 in 2006 to 130,000 in 2021. Nasrallah has claimed the group commands 100,000 fighters.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people made assumptions about how deterred Hamas and Hezbollah are,\u201d said Matthew Levitt, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. While he broadly agreed with the U. S. intelligence assessment, Levitt said that Hezbollah was now more likely to take advantage of the war in the south, which has consumed much of the Israeli military\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cI do see [Hezbollah] gradually trying to change the rules of the game,\u201d Levitt said. Both sides have exchanged artillery and rocket fire since the Hamas attack Saturday. Israel has deployed reservist troops to towns along the border with Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah leaders\u2019 rhetoric has already begun to shift. In the first speech by a Hezbollah official after the Hamas attack, Hashem Safieddine declared the group is \u201cnot neutral in this battle.\u201d Hezbollah\u2019s fighters \u201chad given their salute to Gaza in Shebaa Farms in their own, special way,\u201d he said, referencing the strikes Hezbollah launched into a contested region on the border between the two countries on Sunday.\n\nBut, as the U. S. intelligence analysis warned, such provocations carry their own risks of escalation, especially if Hezbollah conducts what it intends to be limited strikes that end up killing Israeli forces or civilians."

    "description": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider, more devastating Middle East conflict are growing as clashes with Hezbollah intensify amid warnings from Tehran.",
    "content": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider and more devastating Middle East war are growing as clashes with Iranian-backed Hezbollah intensify along Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon and Israel presses ahead with its plans for a ground incursion into Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas. The fears spiked on Tuesday following a strike on a Gaza hospital that appears to have killed hundreds of people, triggering angry denunciations and calls for vengeance across the region. Demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank, marched to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and converged on Israeli diplomatic missions in Turkey and Jordan, blaming the strike on Israel, which has denied responsibility.\n\nThe bloodshed fueled already rising tensions between Israel and Iran, which backs Hamas along with an array of allied militias and proxies. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned before the strike that Iran\u2019s militia allies in the \u201cresistance front\u201d could take what he called \u201cpreemptive action\u201d to deter an Israeli ground offensive, and the risk is high that an incident such as this could prompt escalatory attacks in revenge. \u201cWe have to retaliate from Lebanon,\u201d the demonstrators chanted in Beirut.\n\nOver the past decade, Iran has built up a formidable array of militias and proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in addition to Hamas, and all or any of them could be called on to open up new fronts. Iran also has to calculate whether it can afford to expend the considerable military leverage it derives from these allies in a potentially ruinous conflict for the purpose of defending one of them, Hamas, in Gaza.\n\nWashington has positioned two aircraft carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah, and could also be drawn into the fight if Hezbollah launches a full-scale assault on Israel. Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah forces there, would almost certainly join in; there have already been exchanges of fire along the Syrian border, and activists report that Iranian-allied fighters have been relocating to southern Syria from the east of the country.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, is the well-armed, battle-trained and highly disciplined Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, said Michael Horowitz, director of intelligence at Le Beck security consultancy. Hezbollah has amassed between 130,000 and 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, some of which could reach deep into Israeli cities or be used to deliver precision strikes against Israeli military facilities such as air bases, curtailing Israel\u2019s fighting capabilities.\n\nBut Israel probably would also inflict massive damage on Lebanon, as it did in the 2006 war and the 1982 invasion of the country. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon that \u201cthe price you will pay will be far heavier\u201d than in any previous war.\n\nIt appears the Iranians do not want an escalation and are keen to find ways to avoid one, according to a regional diplomat familiar with some of the Iranian conversations with that nation\u2019s allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. While making it clear that their allies are prepared to fight, Iran and Hezbollah have not publicly set red lines for what scenario in Gaza would trigger their involvement \u2014 which could range from continued attacks on Gaza, the launch of a ground invasion or only in the event that Hamas is at risk of being completely defeated, the diplomat said.\n\nA senior Hamas official, speaking from Beirut, insisted that Iran was not involved in the Hamas assault, in which at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed and nearly 200 taken hostage. He said Hamas had not anticipated the scale and speed of the collapse of Israel\u2019s defenses and that Hamas was caught off guard also by the ferocity of Israel\u2019s response; over 3,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli airstrikes, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\n\u201cOf course the Iranians help us and train us and give us support, but this operation specifically was very confidential and secret,\u201d said Ali Barakah, who heads Hamas\u2019s international relations department. He described what he said was intended as a \u201climited operation\u201d to trade Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners and said the expectation was that Israel would conduct limited airstrikes against Gaza before embarking on negotiations.\n\nBuilt up over decades since the creation of Hezbollah in 1982, the strategy aims to position enough militia firepower on Israel\u2019s borders to deter an Israeli attack on Iran, a long-standing fear that has grown in recent years as Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. The Palestinian cause is central to the strategy and to Iran\u2019s identity as a revolutionary Islamic state.\n\nOver the past two years, Iran has sought to reinforce the strategy with a concept known as \u201cunity of fronts,\u201d under which Hezbollah, Hamas and other regional allies have pledged closer cooperation and mutual defense, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah and Hamas have set up a joint coordination center in Beirut with a view to collaborating in ways that further deter Israel from attacks on any one of them.\n\nIran almost certainly doesn\u2019t want to risk undermining Hezbollah\u2019s deterrent capabilities for the sake of Gaza, but at the same time it can\u2019t afford to be seen as abandoning its allies if the deterrence is to survive, Knights said."

    "description": "Protesters from Morocco to Iran condemned Israel and the United States for a deadly hospital attack \u2014 dismissing Israeli statements blaming Palestinian militants.",
    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 Israel and its staunch ally the United States were targets of rage, condemnation and protest that surged across the Middle East as demonstrators and regional governments seethed over a blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of people. Protesters took to the streets from Morocco to Iran, in marches held in front of Israeli or U.S. diplomatic missions or those of other Western allies of Israel, including Britain and France. The blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which Palestinian officials blamed on an Israeli airstrike, was branded an outrage and a war crime by protesters. Israel said it had evidence the strike was the result of a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nIn the region, little attention was paid to Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility, or Biden\u2019s agreement that Palestinian militants were responsible. Rather, influential governments such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 which in recent months had been exploring normalized ties with Israel \u2014 immediately condemned what it said was a \u201cheinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government mended relations with Israel recently after a long period of strained ties, posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201chitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel\u2019s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.\u201d Protesters burned Israeli flags in front of the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe protests also reflected mounting public dismay at the soaring Palestinian death toll after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes, analysts said. They also posed a challenge to Arab governments that have reached \u2014 or were considering \u2014 deals normalizing relations with Israel, bargains predicated on the notion that popular expressions of sympathy for Palestinians could be contained.\n\nBut in an outburst as sprawling as any in years, protesters waved Palestinian flags atop mopeds in Beirut, outside the U. S. Embassy in Jordan and on a storied Tunisian boulevard. \u201cWhere is the Arab army?\u201d university students chanted in Minya, an Egyptian heartland town south of Cairo.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official speaking to reporters in Beirut on Wednesday, called on Arab and Muslim states to \u201cend all forms of normalization and cooperation\u201d with Israel and to expel its ambassadors from their countries. The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that at least 3,478 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.\n\nPeople took to the streets late Tuesday, soon after images spread of stricken Palestinians at al-Ahli Hospital. In Beirut, demonstrators marched to the U. S. Embassy, as the army barricaded the site to prevent protesters from reaching the facility. Protesters beat on the barricade, trying to tear it down.\n\n\u201cOf course, the presumption being that this was an Israeli missile strike,\u201d he added. For that to change, \u201cthe Israelis are going to have to produce really ironclad proof to show that it wasn\u2019t them, and I don\u2019t think they can do that.\u201d\n\nThe swift condemnations of the hospital explosion from some Arab governments \u2014 such as the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 \u2014 indicated Israel\u2019s withering assault on Gaza was provoking far more anxiety in the region than in recent conflicts past. The most recent conflict started when Hamas militants staged a brazen attack on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 soldiers and civilians and seizing about 200 hostages.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the Emirates condemned the \u201cIsrael attack\u201d on the hospital and called for an \u201cimmediate cease-fire\u201d \u2014 a step allies Israel and the United States have both ruled out. Israel appears ready for a ground invasion of Gaza that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, leading to fears it could ignite a regional war.\n\nBy Wednesday, the protests had grown. Videos posted on social media showed crowds waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Large crowds of university students took to the streets Wednesday in Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo, according to videos posted on social media.\n\nAnger was mounting, too, near the Egyptian border, where truck drivers organized by the Egyptian Red Crescent have been waiting for days to be given the green light to bring humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.\n\nIn one video posted on TikTok on Tuesday night, a man \u2014 apparently involved in the aid effort \u2014 yells at the camera: \u201cIf there is bombing, I\u2019ll go in. If there is death, I\u2019ll go in. I came here determined to go in.\u201d\n\nAn accumulation of grievances \u2014 over the Arab normalization deals with Israel and incursions onto the holy al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel\u2019s hard-right government \u2014 seemed to be fueling the protests, said Zaha Hassan, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhile many media organizations were unable to enter Gaza \u2014 barred by Israel and Egypt \u2014 Palestinians there were talking to Arab outlets including Al Jazeera, which had correspondents in the enclave, and posting on TikTok and other social media outlets, \u201cin real time as things are happening, with anger and urgency,\u201d she said."

    "content": "The Tribe of Nova trance music festival, near Kibbutz Re\u2019im, was one of the first targets for Hamas militants as they launched their unprecedented attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, overrunning the concert area, shooting into the crowd and grabbing as many hostages as they could. Festivalgoers described how the gunmen blocked roads, ambushed escaping cars and scoured the area looking for people to kidnap.\n\nAt least 260 bodies were recovered from the concert site Sunday, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response group in Israel. Across the country, at least 700 people have been killed. Dozens are still missing, according to the Israel Defense Forces; Israeli media has put the figure at more than 100. Hamas says hostages are being held in tunnels and other secure locations in Gaza.\n\nThe attendees had not been given the exact location of the festival until a few hours before it began at 10 p.m. Friday. \u201cThe event will take place in a powerful natural location full of trees, stunning in its beauty and organized for your convenience, about an hour and a quarter south of Tel Aviv,\u201d ticket buyers were told in the lead-up.\n\nThe festival was held just three miles from the fence that divides Israel from the Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million inhabitants. The ravers were told not to bring firearms or sharp objects onto the festival grounds. They were tired and defenseless when the attack began, trapped in a wide-open area that offered few hiding places.\n\nBen Haim saw the militants in the distance, closing in on foot. \u201cI took the car keys from a friend of mine that was really wasted and got as many people in the car as possible and started driving like crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who stayed, most of them got kidnapped or murdered.\u201d\n\nThey drove on for a few hundred meters and then abandoned the car, running past another with several dead bodies next to it. As he hid, Raz thought about his girlfriend, whom he is planning to marry, and about his family.\n\nOn Saturday, they saw the couple in a video circulating on Palestinian social media. It shows Argamani screaming as she is separated from her boyfriend and driven off on a motorcycle. Or appears to have his hands bound and is pushed along by several young men.\n\nArgamani had debated not going to the festival, but not because of security concerns. \u201cIf she knew it was tense right now, then I think she wouldn\u2019t have gone, but we knew nothing,\u201d Marciano said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t sure because it was far and expensive. I told her, \u2018Go; you\u2019re young.\u2019 I regret that.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the woman is facedown in the bed of the truck with four militants, apparently being paraded through Gaza. One holds her hair while another raises a gun in the air and shouts, \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d A crowd follows the truck cheering. A boy spits in her hair."

Think through what you\u2019re going to do, what implications it\u2019s going to have for the country, for the region, and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia has agreed to free four Ukrainian children \u2014 ranging in age from 2 to 17 \u2014 and allow them to return them to their families in Ukraine after Qatar intervened as a mediator, according to a government official briefed on the matter. Two of the children are now back with relatives and two others are expected to be reunited with their families in the coming days, the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations, said,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n O\u2019Grady reports.\n\n\u201cWith less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses, the 2024 presidential candidates were required to file their third-quarter fundraising reports by midnight Sunday. Former president Donald Trump reported a huge cash advantage over his Republican rivals at the end of September, a haul bolstered by his pleas to his donors to aid his effort as he is set to face multiple legal trials next year,\u201d Maeve Reston, Clara Ence Morse and Hannah Knowles report.\n\n\u201cNow the fates of the two issues may be linked in coming weeks on Capitol Hill, as the Biden administration weighs combining aid for those two countries, as well as funding for Taiwan and the U. S. border, into one complicated package that a still-to-be-named new House speaker would have to shepherd,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui and John McCormick report.\n\n\u201cFred Daibes, the New Jersey real estate tycoon at the center of an international scandal threatening the career of Senator Robert Menendez, has found his way out of more than one tough spot over the course of his tumultuous life,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Elise Young and Tracey Tully report.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s administration sold off more than 40 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last year to help limit rising fuel prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, leaving the stockpile at its lowest levels since the early 1980s. That\u2019s fueling Republican accusations that Biden has left the U. S. vulnerable to a disruption of global oil supplies \u2014 at a time when Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks in Israel are stoking fears of a wider regional war disrupting fuel shipments from the Middle East,\u201d Politico\u2019s Ben Lefebvre reports."

    "description": "Despite reports of a deal to let dual nationals out and aid into Gaza, Israel and Hamas announced that there would be no cease-fire, dashing the hopes of hundreds.",
    "content": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel\u2019s war cabinet when the country\u2019s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah \u201cwill be opened\u201d so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n\u201cIf we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,\u201d said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. \u201cIt fell in the sand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration\u2019s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East \u2014 essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation\u2019s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas\u2019s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza."

    "description": "After a historic level of antisemitic acts in America last year, local Jewish communities are on edge after the attacks in Israel.",
    "content": "\u201cImmediately, as we woke up to the news on Saturday, we talked to law enforcement,\u201d said Meredith Weisel, the regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the D. C. area. \u201cWe have requested that they continue to increase patrols of Jewish institutions.\u201d\n\nAntisemitic incidents in the United States reached historic levels in 2022 \u2014 the highest since the ADL began collecting data in 1979, according to its  audit. (Disturbingly, I wrote a similar line when the Jewish Community Center in Fairfax County was covered in 19 swastikas overnight in 2018. The number of acts is exponentially growing.)\n\nAnd against that backdrop \u2014 a domestic hostility that has steadily increased year after year \u2014 the massacre in Israel feels palpable and even foreboding here in America, where hatred of Jews is very real.\n\nWhile American Jews like her who remember the 1973 Yom Kippur War may have felt an existential threat when Israel was attacked back then, it wasn\u2019t as personal and immediately menacing as the Hamas attack today.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just grew up in a part of Chicago where most people got along,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were signs at restaurants and country clubs that said \u2018Members Only,\u2019 and we knew that meant \u2018No Jews.\u2019 But swastikas? It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, there was no information highway to spread the hate so quickly back then. Already, monitors at the ADL are seeing an uptick in hate speech and threats online, Weisel said. The group\u2019s website has resources for people who want to help.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely worried that here in the U. S. and here in our region,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen something happens in Israel, we see it repeated here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a runner; I happened to be out running early in the morning,\u201d she said, and she saw swastikas and \u201cKKK\u201d scrawled all over the place where her family worships in Gaithersburg, Md., the Shaare Torah synagogue. \u201cIt stopped me dead in my tracks. It was horrible. This is a place that my kids call a second home. They went to preschool there.\u201d\n\nThose are the images that come to mind as her family hears the news from Israel and as the incidents across the nation grow, at the same time books about the Holocaust \u2014 among them \u201cNight\u201d by Elie Wiesel, \u201cThe Diary of a Young Girl\u201d by Anne Frank and \u201cMaus,\u201d the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel by Art Spiegelman \u2014 are being banned from school libraries.\n\nJust days after that massacre, D. C. police arrested a man who said he supported that attack. Jeffrey \u201cRaph\u201d Clark, a guy born in D.C. who went to liberal, local schools, had a basement full of nooses, ammo, armored vests and a sketch of someone with a gun aimed at the head of a bearded man wearing a yarmulke.\n\nClark alarmed his family when he defended the synagogue massacre. On Gab, he called the shooter a hero and said, of those killed, that \u201cevery last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,\u201d according to court documents. (Clark was sentenced to time served after serving almost 10 months for a federal gun charge.)\n\nAccording to a spreadsheet showing hate incidents in Montgomery County in March, kids have found swastikas scrawled on desks, drawers, doors, tables and chairs. A child found one on a piece of paper stuffed into his backpack. There was a tiny one on the edge of a Jenga block. Many in bathrooms. This was just one month.\n\nHe knows there are kids who have family members and friends in Israel who are unaccounted for. He\u2019s hoping the schools will be proactive in helping these students with counseling and messaging, for both Jewish and Muslim students who may be within the emotional blast radius of events happening far from home."

    "description": "The strike on the hospital came as President Biden was set to visit the region and humanitarian aid for Gaza remained stranded on the Egyptian border.",
    "content": "Israel and Hamas traded blame for the bloodshed at al-Ahli Hospital, which appeared to be the deadliest single strike on civilians in Gaza since the conflict began. The fallout was immediate and worrisome, including clashes between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Jordan called off a summit where Biden planned to meet regional Arab leaders to seek ways to keep tensions from spreading.\n\nThe strike on the hospital was certain to loom over and complicate Biden\u2019s planned visit to Israel on Wednesday, meant to be a show of solidarity for Israel after Hamas militants attacked dozens of border communities Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people, taking more than 200 back to Gaza as hostages and setting off the country\u2019s worst crisis in decades.\n\nIn response to the Hamas attack, Israel has throttled Gaza, a 25-mile-long enclave under Hamas control that is home to 2 million people, sealing it off from aid deliveries and cutting off electricity amid blistering airstrikes and an expected ground incursion. The effect has been what a U. N. agency has called a \u201cbone-chilling\u201d humanitarian crisis that has turned the densely populated and besieged enclave into a \u201chellhole.\u201d\n\nPalestinian officials said before the hospital bloodshed that at least 2,778 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 10,000 wounded. The hospital strike came as dwindling fuel supplies were pushing Gaza\u2019s health-care system close to collapse. The only oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip was days away from halting services because of the shortages, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military ordered all civilians in Gaza City and northern neighborhoods to evacuate last week, triggering hundreds of thousands to head south to Gaza. But many refused to go, and some people who stayed in Gaza City moved near hospitals such as Ahli, hoping medical complexes would be safer and less likely to be hit.\n\n\u201cWe all know that all of those hospitals and their courtyards have thousands of displaced people,\u201d Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said at a news conference. \u201cThey go to these hospitals because they expect safe places. If even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?\u201d\n\nBiden is among several world leaders who have visited or announced plans to visit Israel, many of them also trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting that would allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and let in the humanitarian aid."

    "description": "Militants entered Israel in at least five places, videos verified by The Post show.",
    "content": "Palestinian fighters breached the Gaza border in at least five places on Saturday in the deadliest incursion into Israel in decades, and appeared to catch Israeli soldiers by surprise in dawn assaults on fortified installations, according to videos verified by The Washington Post. The videos, released by Hamas on social media, showed militants using explosives and other means to breach Israel\u2019s border fence with Gaza, then driving and jogging, sometimes for several miles, to attack weakly guarded military posts and towns, where they killed and captured Israeli soldiers and civilians.\n\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the assault, which began while Israel was observing a religious holiday that falls the day after the festival of Sukkot. The groups also launched more than 3,000 rockets, the Israel Defense Forces said. At least 700 people in Israel were killed and thousands wounded, Israeli media said on Sunday.\n\nSkip to end of carouselPresident Biden said the U. S. would not support a major Israeli military operation in Rafah without a credible plan for civilian safety. At least 67 Palestinians were killed during strikes Monday in Rafah that the Israeli military described as providing cover for the rescue of two hostages.For context: Understand what\u2019s behind the Israel-Gaza war.The videos verified by The Post showed scores of fighters breaching the border with little opposition, armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. They poured into Israel on the ground, flew in with fan-driven paragliders and used commercial drones to attack Israeli military targets, including tanks and communications infrastructure.One video shows fighters from Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, using explosives against a section of border wall near the Erez crossing, the only one available for Gazans to travel into Israel, located at the northern end of the Gaza Strip. The video shows at least seven gunmen running toward the crossing, moving through a security checkpoint and firing at a guard tower.\n\nIn the video, a fighter shoots a bloodied body on the ground in a hallway as he catches up with a group of other militants, who appear to be capturing two men clothed in only shorts and T-shirts. Later in the video, as the fighters clear hallways and living quarters, several other bodies can be seen on the ground. It was not clear from their clothing if they were in the military.\n\nAnother video filmed at sunrise shows fighters on foot and motorcycles passing through an opening made in the border fence near Kerem Shalom, a kibbutz on Israel\u2019s southern border with Egypt near a major border crossing of the same name. The video then cuts to the fighters storming a military outpost about three miles to the north.\n\nSkip to end of carouselHow we verify videos of the Israel-Gaza warThe Post only publishes verified videos of the Israel-Gaza war. Verification takes rigorous reporting, fact-checking and collaboration to make sure a video hasn\u2019t been manipulated, either through missing context, deceptive editing or malicious transformation. Here\u2019s how we do it:1. We geolocate the video by cross-referencing distinctive landmarks in the footage with reliable source material such as satellite imagery or Google Earth.2. We translate any dialogue in the video to see if there are context clues.3. We investigate when the video was recorded, using metadata, time stamps and the position of the sun. Other visuals, official statements, eyewitness testimony and audio also provide context that help corroborate videos.3. We review the uploader\u2019s account and try to find the original source for the video.4. We consult with military experts when weapons and military equipment may be clues about what transpired.5. We screen for fake videos by examining whether there are jump cuts, interrupted audio, or visuals and audio that doesn\u2019t match.6. We run a reverse-image search and look for other posts on the same topic to make sure it is not an old video \u2014 perhaps even from a different conflict \u2014 that is recirculating.Once the fighters reached Be\u2019eri, nearly three miles from the Gaza border, other videos, including one posted on X (formerly Twitter) showed them dragging at least five people away. Two appear to be older and thinly dressed, and all are barefoot, with their hands tied behind them.\n\nIsraeli and Hamas officials both confirmed that Israeli military personnel and civilians were taken captive across southern Israel during the assault, though the total number and their condition is unknown. A spokesperson for Hamas\u2019s armed wing said there were \u201ctens\u201d of soldiers and officers in the group\u2019s custody, a Reuters journalist in Gaza reported. The Israeli Embassy in the United States posted on X that there were 100 \u201ckidnapped civilians and soldiers.\u201d\n\nIn Nahal Oz, less than a mile from where fighters breached the border fence, they stormed a military base and used a commercial drone to drop an explosive on Israeli soldiers standing near an ambulance. The videos from the base showed fighters taking female prisoners.\n\nPalestinian fighters also managed to reach Sderot, a town of about 30,000 people roughly three miles from the Erez crossing in north Gaza. Images from Sderot showed more than a half-dozen civilians bloodied and slumped around a bus stop in the city, and videos showed armed men in a pickup truck firing at an Israeli police vehicle.\n\nThe Saturday assault took place under the cover of a large rocket barrage that began at about 6:30 a.m. and was aimed at cities across Israel. The Post verified footage taken in the aftermath of several reported strikes, including in Tel Aviv and the southern city of Netivot. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Israeli casualties resulted from close-contact shooting, not rockets.\n\nGaza was plunged into darkness on Saturday evening after Israel cut off its electricity and launched waves of airstrikes into the enclave. The Israeli air force hit what it described as 17 military compounds and four operational command centers belonging to Hamas. Footage taken Saturday showed the destruction of a 14-story residential building in Gaza City known as the Palestine Tower."

    "description": "For many Palestinians and Palestinian Americans, the days following the horrific assault by Hamas militants on Israel last weekend have been filled with worry.",
    "content": "In their waking hours they watch the news or check their phones, hoping for a text message or maybe a brief call. They want some indication that family members or friends are okay. That they have food and water. That they are alive. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning.For many of the Washington region\u2019s Palestinians and Palestinian Americans, including artists, activists, business owners and educators who have made the area their home, the days following the horrific assault by Hamas militants on Israel last weekend have been filled with worry. They knew there would be retribution for the rocket attacks and bloody incursion that included hostage-taking and claimed the lives of more than 1,300 people in Israel, including many civilians.\n\n\u201cI immediately realized the retaliation is going to be unimaginable, given the wars I\u2019ve lived through,\u201d said Ahmed Mansour, 30, a documentary filmmaker in Silver Spring, Md., who grew up in Gaza and left there in 2015. He said he speaks daily with his parents and eight siblings, who live in the central area of the Gaza Strip. Although they have avoided the worst of the bombardment by Israeli forces, other family members have not escaped. Mansour said that two of his uncles\u2019 homes have been bombed and that one of his cousins was killed.\n\nOn Friday, Israel ordered more than 1 million residents of the narrow and densely populated Gaza Strip to move out of its northern region in anticipation of a ground offensive by the Israeli military to remove Hamas from power. The United Nations called for the evacuation order to be rescinded, saying the mass displacement \u201ccould transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.\u201d\n\nMansour said in an interview Friday that he is worried about his family members and that he also is concerned about how the news media are covering the situation in Gaza, saying they fail to convey in their reporting why anger in Gaza continues to fester and boil over. He also criticized U. S. leaders for not pushing urgently for a peaceful solution.\n\n\u201cFor 15 years, the Gaza Strip has been under siege and endured five wars,\u201d he said, referring to Israel\u2019s tight security cordon around Gaza. \u201cFor 75 years, Palestinians have been enduring one catastrophe after another. \u2026 If we\u2019re serious about what\u2019s really happening, I expected American officials would be more considerate about what\u2019s happening and take it as a chance to really solve it rather than calling for an escalation.\u201d\n\nHanna Alshaikh and her husband, who live in the Washington suburbs, have been in contact every few hours with his parents and family members in Gaza. On Thursday they learned that Alshaikh\u2019s husband\u2019s 88-year-old grandmother was injured when a neighboring home was bombed and glass in her windows shattered. Everyone they know in Gaza knows someone who has been killed or injured or whose home has been destroyed, said Alshaikh, 30, a Palestinian American who is pursuing a doctorate in history at Harvard University.\n\n\u201cWe oscillate between feelings of grief and despair and feelings that time is of the essence and is precious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we do not have the luxury of experiencing our own fear and experiencing our own sadness.\u201d\n\nWhile her husband\u2019s family does not live in the area that has been ordered evacuated, she said, \u201cthey do not feel that anywhere is safe in Gaza. They are packed and ready to leave at any moment.\u201d\n\nAlshaikh also worries that Palestinian Americans may become targets of hate crimes in the United States, especially if they speak out against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Asked about the Hamas raid into Israel last weekend, she said, \u201cNobody wants to see civilians harmed.\u201d\n\nNassar grew up on a farm in Bethlehem in the West Bank where his family grows grapes, olives, almonds and figs. He said he does not have relatives in Gaza but worries about a war that could spread to include the West Bank, a patchwork of areas effectively under Israeli control and others governed by the Palestinian Authority, a longtime rival to Hamas, which is dominant in Gaza. As he has watched events unfold, he can only think, he said, that \u201cviolence is not the answer.\u201d\n\nNassar said he has received text messages from several Jewish friends in the United States asking whether he is okay. On Friday, he heard from a rabbi he had befriended who texted to check on him. The opportunity for similar friendships does not exist where he grew up, he said.\n\nChris Habiby, who lives just outside D. C. and whose parents are Palestinian, said he has been checking on cousins who live in Gaza and have been moving from house to house to stay safe. His family has been able to reach them twice this week."

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.\u201cI think it\u2019d be a big mistake,\u201d Biden said in a response to a question from \u201c60 Minutes\u201d host Scott Pelley. \u201cHamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don\u2019t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that \u2026 it would be a mistake \u2026 for Israel to occupy \u2026 Gaza again.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s warning against reoccupying Gaza amounted to one of his firmest efforts so far to impose a limit on Israel\u2019s actions in retaliation for Hamas attacks that have killed at least 1,400 people. Still, he added, \u201cgoing in but taking out the extremists \u2014 the Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south \u2014 is a necessary requirement.\u201d\n\nBiden sought to draw a distinction between Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza and launched a bloody attack on Israel on Oct. 7, and ordinary Palestinians who are now facing dire conditions in the densely populated enclave of over 2 million people, more than half of whom are children.\n\nEven without a formal occupation, Israel controls most aspects of life in Gaza, and most Palestinians are not able to exit the territory. Israel announced a full siege of Gaza after the attacks, cutting off food, water, fuel and electricity, a tactic that human rights groups have said violates the laws of war. Gaza is almost out of fuel, and many residents do not have access to safe drinking water.\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of that has killed more than 2,600 people. The White House is in discussions with Israeli officials about Biden traveling to Israel, potentially as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about private deliberations.\n\nIsraeli media reported that during a phone call on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invited Biden to Israel. Officials of both countries are talking about the feasibility of such a trip, which could present logistical and political difficulties if Biden visits while a fierce Israeli incursion into Gaza is underway.\n\nIsrael last week urged more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours in advance of its incursion, an order the United Nations called impossible. Hundreds of thousands of Gaza civilians have fled south, while others chose to stay in their homes after hearing reports of airstrikes hitting potential exit routes.\n\nAsked whether Israel would pursue a path toward a Palestinian state after the Hamas attacks, Biden said \u201cnot now.\u201d Still, he added, \u201cI think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nPalestinian gunmen from Hamas launched their surprise attack more than a week ago after breaking through Israel\u2019s sophisticated border fence. The militants hunted civilians in their homes and cars and took scores of people hostage into Gaza, including some Americans. At least 30 U. S. citizens were killed in the attacks, U.S. officials said.\n\nBiden and his top officials have said they are working to secure humanitarian corridors into Gaza to enable fuel and food to come in. Israel\u2019s energy minister, Israel Katz, said Sunday that Netanyahu and Biden have reached a deal to restore water supplies to some parts of southern Gaza.\n\nWhen asked whether it was time for a cease-fire, given the number of Palestinian civilians who have already been killed in the aerial counterattack, Biden said Israel has a duty to respond to the horrific attacks.\n\n\u201cIsrael is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIsrael has to respond. They have to go after Hamas. Hamas is a bunch of cowards. They\u2019re hiding behind the civilians.\u201d\n\nBiden, who has spent much of his 50-plus years in politics steeped in foreign policy, has always been firmly pro-Israel even as some parts of the Democratic Party have increasingly questioned the U. S. military and diplomatic support for the country.\n\nSome liberals have raised concerns over Israel\u2019s years-long punishing blockade of Gaza and its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu has also formed the most far-right government in Israel\u2019s history, sought to overhaul its independent judiciary and all but dismissed the idea of a two-state solution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that Israel is going to act under \u2026 the rules of war,\u201d Biden said, a statement he has made multiple times in the past week. \u201cThere\u2019s standards that democratic institutions and countries go by. And so I\u2019m confident that there\u2019s going to be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water.\u201d"

    "description": "Both a shooting in Brussels and a stabbing at a French high school are being treated as terrorist attacks.",
    "content": "BRUSSELS \u2014 Police fatally shot the gunman who killed two people in the Belgian capital in a terrorist attack, authorities said Tuesday, ending a manhunt that had left the city on edge, but doing little to ease fears of an uptick in political violence across Europe. The attack in Brussels came days after a teacher was fatally stabbed at French high school in what authorities are investigating as a terrorist attack. And countries across Europe have been on guard for political violence that might spill over from the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nMonday\u2019s attack in Brussels targeted three Swedish nationals, killing two and wounding one, on an evening when Sweden was playing Belgium in a Europe 2024 qualifier soccer match. That game was suspended and the city put on high alert while police searched for the attacker.\n\n\u201cLast night, three people left for what was supposed to be a wonderful soccer party. Two of them lost their lives in a brutal terrorist attack,\u201d Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said at an early morning news conference. \u201cTheir lives were cut short in full flight, cut down by extreme brutality.\u201d\n\nDe Croo said the attacker was Tunisian and had been \u201cstaying illegally in our country.\u201d Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne said the man had been denied asylum in 2019 and had been previously suspected of involvement in human trafficking and being a risk to state security. He suggested that the attacker may have targeted nationals of Sweden because of Quran burnings there, which have led to threats and protests.\n\nIn a video that emerged after the shooting, a man asserted responsibility for the attack and identified himself as a member of the Islamic State extremist group \u2014 though Belgium\u2019s federal prosecutor said he was probably a lone wolf.\n\n\u201cWe all have a vulnerability. It\u2019s what comes with being a democracy, a rule-of-law state where there are individuals who can decide at a given moment to commit the worst acts,\u201d Macron told reporters while visiting the Albanian capital, Tirana, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nAlthough neither of the attacks appears to have strong links to the war between Israel and Hamas, many European capitals have heightened their security over concern that the conflict will spur violence in their own countries. In recent days, cultural landmarks in France and schools in multiple countries have received bomb threats, while authorities reported a rise in antisemitic hate crimes.\n\nSince Hamas launched its attack on Israel, the European Union has conveyed conflicting messages \u2014 over whether aid to Palestinians should continue, over whether Israel needs to emphasize restraint \u2014 inviting criticism from all sides.\n\n\u201cThe E. U. will have little ability to influence events unfolding in Israel and Gaza but could be seriously impacted by them,\u201d wrote Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.\n\nAlthough Belgian officials said the gunman in Monday\u2019s attack had a criminal record and was known by local authorities, federal prosecutor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Leeuw said, \u201cWe did not have indications that the person needed to be watched.\u201d\n\nThe suspect in France had likewise been known to security authorities \u2014 French intelligence officials had been wiretapping his conversations and had interacted with him a day before, but said they had no evidence on which to detain him before the stabbing.\n\nFor France and Belgium, the attacks are a reminder of a spate of terrorist violence in 2015 and 2016. In July, six men were convicted for their roles in a 2016 attack that killed 32 and injured hundreds in Brussels. A year before that assault, a team of gunmen claiming allegiance to the Islamic State carried out attacks in Paris that killed over 100 people.\n\nDespite measures put in place to stop those kinds of attacks from happening again, the attacker in Brussels managed to kill two people and escape the scene of the crime, sowing fear across the city.\n\nThe Swedish team donned black arm bands in their match on Tuesday and posted on social media: \u201cYesterday we tragically lost two blue-and-yellow supporters, on site in Brussels to do something that should be a matter of course \u2014 to support our Swedish national team in the blue and yellow national team shirt. Our thoughts go out to all the loved ones of the victims.\u201d\n\nThe attacker remained at large overnight. According to the federal prosecutor\u2019s office, a witness called Brussels police at 8 a.m. Tuesday to say the suspect was in a cafe in the Schaerbeek district. \u201cThe police arrived at the scene and during the intervention, the suspect was shot,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe emergency services also arrived at the scene and tried to resuscitate the man.\u201d He was pronounced dead at the hospital."

This past Sunday, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired another interview with the president, offering his most direct answers yet to questions about the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nBiden is hardly the first president to turn to nontraditional sources to reach a different audience. Clinton appeared on an MTV town hall in 1994 (where he was asked if he wore boxers or briefs). President Barack Obama appeared on the comedy show \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d in 2014 (where he was asked, \u201cHow does it feel to be the last Black president?\u201d)"

    "description": "What began as a highly organized stealth attack soon devolved into a chaotic rampage, underscoring Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing.",
    "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the morning of Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas militants switched on their GoPros and cellphones and began live-streaming the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, massacring at least 1,400 people and abducting nearly 200, according to Israeli authorities. What began as a highly organized stealth attack, using drone technology to overtake Israeli military observation points, soon devolved into a bloody and chaotic rampage. It underscored Hamas\u2019s capacity for sophisticated planning and indiscriminate killing; the ability of the group to conceal details of a massive offensive operation; and its struggle to manage fighters once they had bulldozed their way through Israel\u2019s border fence.\n\nHamas\u2019s political leadership in exile said it was shocked at the lack of resistance: \u201cWe were expecting to get a smaller number of hostages and return, but the army collapsed in front of us, what were we to do?\u201d Ali Barakeh, a Beirut-based Hamas representative, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nMiri Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces, said the operation was the result of at least two years of planning, a period that included two conflicts between the IDF and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in Gaza. At the time, Hamas was criticized for standing on the sidelines as PIJ leaders were eliminated by Israeli strikes.\n\nIt was part of a vast con, said Eisin, \u201cto lull Israel into complacency,\u201d while Hamas gathered intelligence and quietly built up its capabilities. The fighters\u2019 apparent knowledge of Israeli border towns could have been gleaned in part from the thousands of Gazans who crossed the Israeli border on a daily basis, Eisin said, earning wages in the same communities that were overrun.\n\n\u201cThose who attacked Israel are not terrorist squads, but a commando brigade belonging to a large army, numbering in the tens of thousands, built over time with funds intended for humanitarian causes,\u201d said Meir Ben Shabbat, a former Israeli national security adviser, adding that some of the militants carried \u201cdata files on the territories and settlements they raided.\u201d\n\nIn a rare all-staff memo made public on Monday, Ronen Bar, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, took responsibility for the failure to foresee the attack: \u201cThe responsibility is mine,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cDespite a series of actions we carried out, unfortunately \u2026 we were unable to establish sufficient deterrence so as to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nThe militants burned corpses, beheaded a wounded man with a garden hoe and fatally shot drivers as they entered residential towns, according to hours of videos gathered by the Israeli military, some of which were shared with journalists on Monday. The images could not be independently verified by The Post.\n\nThe Israeli military is holding a number of gunmen from Gaza whom it captured in the course of the attacks, officials said, and the captives have provided material and information that remains classified.\n\nAs the killing expanded to more than 20 Israeli towns and kibbutzim, one video shows militants trying to cram a large group of wounded hostages, two bodies deep, into the back of a pickup truck. Militants who streamed in on motorcycles scrambled to find vehicles to carry their hostages back to Gaza. In Kfar Azza, militants went down the lines of parked cars, breaking windows and looking for one to steal. Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old grandmother from the community of Nir Oz, was ferried over the border on a golf cart.\n\nBarakeh, the Hamas representative, said the aim of attack was \u201cto free Palestinian prisoners, stop Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque, and to break the siege on Gaza,\u201d Instead, the assault has led to unprecedented Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, killing more than 2,700 people, and has rallied much of the world behind Israel as it prepares for a large-scale land invasion.\n\n\u201cHamas thinks they carried out this operation, this thing that they called an attack for their freedom, and through their framing, they believe that they will win the coming war against Israel,\u201d said Eisin, the former IDF intelligence officer. \u201cBut just as Hamas removed all red lines in targeting civilians, so too will Israel retaliate,\u201d she said, predicting \u201ca war for which we don\u2019t yet have the words to describe.\u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Hamas\u2019s longtime rival \u2014 was teetering on collapse, seen by many as complicit in Israeli raids that have made 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territory in two decades. The authority, and its aging leader Mahmoud Abbas, stood to gain from a U. S. diplomatic push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, efforts that may have been permanently derailed by the attack."

    "description": "As Gazans flee, Israel\u2019s military leadership readies a broad offensive. But experts in urban warfare warn that the terrain is troublesome and the endgame uncertain.",
    "content": "The operation is expected to be the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 most significant in years, pitting them against Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out an unprecedented massacre in Israel beginning Oct. 7 in which more than 1,300 people were killed and up to 150 were kidnapped. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that \u201cevery Hamas fighter\u201d will be \u201cdestroyed,\u201d while the Israeli government has urged civilians in Gaza to evacuate Gaza City.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to go back in, heavy, and it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for everybody,\u201d said Kenneth \u201cFrank\u201d McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general who served as the chief of U. S. Central Command until last year. He predicted that the violence will be \u201cdragged out over a much longer period of time\u201d than the Hamas attack, with the Israelis getting bogged down in the messy unpredictability of urban warfare.\n\nThe IDF has experience with operations in Gaza, a 140-square-mile enclave on the southwest corner of Israel that borders the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt. Limited ground offensives in 2014 and 2009 were designed to punish and degrade Hamas, but the scope and scale of the recent atrocities \u2014 including an assault by gunmen on a music festival that killed at least 260 and the killing of children and elderly people \u2014 have prompted Israeli cries for an invasion that would \u201cend\u201d the  militant group.\n\nIsraeli officials have broadcast their intentions for days, dropping leaflets over Gaza City that instruct civilians to flee south and not return until further notice. More than half the population of more than 2 million has been directed to evacuate, drawing alarm from humanitarian groups and the United Nations, which said doing so will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for many. IDF officials said on Saturday that they would soon launch an \u201cintegrated and coordinated attack\u201d by land, air and sea, and accused Hamas of blocking civilians from departing northern Gaza.\n\nGian Gentile, a retired Army colonel and military historian with the Rand Corp., said that the scope of Israel\u2019s offensive is \u201cobviously going to be much larger\u201d now than operations in recent years, and will come with challenges that the United States was able to avoid in some of its most intense urban combat, such as the November 2004 assault on Fallujah, Iraq. While that city of 250,000 people was isolated in a desert and most civilians left before the U. S. offensive began, it will be more difficult for civilians to flee this time, Gentile said.\n\nBut Hoffman also said that the challenges that Israeli soldiers will find in Gaza will be \u201cexponentially greater\u201d than what U. S. troops faced in Fallujah. Hamas officials have claimed multiyear preparation and planning for their attack on Israel, he noted, and probably expected that the IDF would respond with a ground invasion. Both sides are likely to use aerial drones, he said, possibly resulting in \u201cdog fights\u201d between them with parallels to how crewed aircraft were used in earlier wars.\n\nBut he cited as a counterexample a campaign waged against the Tamil Tigers, a militant group that, for decades, launched suicide attacks on officials and civilians in India and Sri Lanka. It was eventually wiped out in 2009, after a brutal military offensive by Sri Lankan government forces into territory the Tamil Tigers controlled. A U. N. panel later found that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the process, most from shelling by Sri Lankan forces.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and co-founder of the Lobo Institute, said that the IDF has superior troops, weapons and equipment to those of Hamas. But Hamas, he said, has \u201cbecome very efficient\u201d at fighting in urban terrain and has probably prepared for Israeli forces.\n\nMulroy, who served in both the Marine Corps and CIA, said that the IDF is likely gathering intelligence now as it plans the ground offensive and using airstrikes to shape the battlefield to Israeli forces\u2019 advantage. He predicted that the main assault force will come from Israel through the Erez crossing into Gaza, at the far northern end of the strip, and that it will include battle tanks and armored personnel carriers. The IDF also may attempt to punch into Gaza from the east, effectively cutting the territory in two and limiting Hamas\u2019s ability to move fighters and equipment, he said.\n\nBlaise Misztal, vice president for policy at JINSA, said one consideration for Israeli officials is how to extricate the IDF from Gaza after Israeli officials believe they have achieved their goals. Israel has not had a permanent presence within Gaza since 2005, when the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew the IDF, believing that an occupation there wasn\u2019t sustainable.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to go into Gaza again. They didn\u2019t want to occupy it. They didn\u2019t want to be responsible for administrating it,\u201d Misztal said. \u201cBut now what are they going to do, if they have this much more maximalist objective?\u201d\n\nA senior U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Thursday that the Biden administration does not plan to put additional U.S. forces on the ground in Israel \u201cat this time\u201d \u2014 but did not rule out that deployments could occur if the conflict widens. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday that he was deploying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, joining the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group in a rare concentration of U.S. military power."

    "description": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider, more devastating Middle East conflict are growing as clashes with Hezbollah intensify amid warnings from Tehran.",
    "content": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider and more devastating Middle East war are growing as clashes with Iranian-backed Hezbollah intensify along Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon and Israel presses ahead with its plans for a ground incursion into Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas. The fears spiked on Tuesday following a strike on a Gaza hospital that appears to have killed hundreds of people, triggering angry denunciations and calls for vengeance across the region. Demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank, marched to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and converged on Israeli diplomatic missions in Turkey and Jordan, blaming the strike on Israel, which has denied responsibility.\n\nThe bloodshed fueled already rising tensions between Israel and Iran, which backs Hamas along with an array of allied militias and proxies. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned before the strike that Iran\u2019s militia allies in the \u201cresistance front\u201d could take what he called \u201cpreemptive action\u201d to deter an Israeli ground offensive, and the risk is high that an incident such as this could prompt escalatory attacks in revenge. \u201cWe have to retaliate from Lebanon,\u201d the demonstrators chanted in Beirut.\n\nOver the past decade, Iran has built up a formidable array of militias and proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in addition to Hamas, and all or any of them could be called on to open up new fronts. Iran also has to calculate whether it can afford to expend the considerable military leverage it derives from these allies in a potentially ruinous conflict for the purpose of defending one of them, Hamas, in Gaza.\n\nWashington has positioned two aircraft carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah, and could also be drawn into the fight if Hezbollah launches a full-scale assault on Israel. Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah forces there, would almost certainly join in; there have already been exchanges of fire along the Syrian border, and activists report that Iranian-allied fighters have been relocating to southern Syria from the east of the country.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, is the well-armed, battle-trained and highly disciplined Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, said Michael Horowitz, director of intelligence at Le Beck security consultancy. Hezbollah has amassed between 130,000 and 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, some of which could reach deep into Israeli cities or be used to deliver precision strikes against Israeli military facilities such as air bases, curtailing Israel\u2019s fighting capabilities.\n\nBut Israel probably would also inflict massive damage on Lebanon, as it did in the 2006 war and the 1982 invasion of the country. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon that \u201cthe price you will pay will be far heavier\u201d than in any previous war.\n\nIt appears the Iranians do not want an escalation and are keen to find ways to avoid one, according to a regional diplomat familiar with some of the Iranian conversations with that nation\u2019s allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. While making it clear that their allies are prepared to fight, Iran and Hezbollah have not publicly set red lines for what scenario in Gaza would trigger their involvement \u2014 which could range from continued attacks on Gaza, the launch of a ground invasion or only in the event that Hamas is at risk of being completely defeated, the diplomat said.\n\nA senior Hamas official, speaking from Beirut, insisted that Iran was not involved in the Hamas assault, in which at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed and nearly 200 taken hostage. He said Hamas had not anticipated the scale and speed of the collapse of Israel\u2019s defenses and that Hamas was caught off guard also by the ferocity of Israel\u2019s response; over 3,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli airstrikes, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\n\u201cOf course the Iranians help us and train us and give us support, but this operation specifically was very confidential and secret,\u201d said Ali Barakah, who heads Hamas\u2019s international relations department. He described what he said was intended as a \u201climited operation\u201d to trade Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners and said the expectation was that Israel would conduct limited airstrikes against Gaza before embarking on negotiations.\n\nBuilt up over decades since the creation of Hezbollah in 1982, the strategy aims to position enough militia firepower on Israel\u2019s borders to deter an Israeli attack on Iran, a long-standing fear that has grown in recent years as Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. The Palestinian cause is central to the strategy and to Iran\u2019s identity as a revolutionary Islamic state.\n\nOver the past two years, Iran has sought to reinforce the strategy with a concept known as \u201cunity of fronts,\u201d under which Hezbollah, Hamas and other regional allies have pledged closer cooperation and mutual defense, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah and Hamas have set up a joint coordination center in Beirut with a view to collaborating in ways that further deter Israel from attacks on any one of them.\n\nIran almost certainly doesn\u2019t want to risk undermining Hezbollah\u2019s deterrent capabilities for the sake of Gaza, but at the same time it can\u2019t afford to be seen as abandoning its allies if the deterrence is to survive, Knights said."

    "description": "Biden walks a fine line as he tries to balance unwavering support for Israel with concern for conditions in Gaza",
    "content": "Democrats have been almost entirely unified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas hunted civilians in their homes and cars, shot people indiscriminately and took scores of hostages, including some Americans, into Gaza. The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.\n\nBut a small yet growing number of Democrats have begun urging the Biden administration to do more to encourage Israel to limit civilian casualties in its counterattack and ensure that innocent Palestinians are able to receive basic needs and humanitarian assistance. The shifting dynamic could create political and diplomatic complications for Biden amid the announcement late Monday that he will visit Israel.\n\nBiden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel\u2019s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians. On Sunday he named a special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, and the White House has begun emphasizing its work to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow through Gaza and that Palestinian civilians can flee areas Israel is targeting.\n\nThis is not the first time Biden\u2019s ironclad support of Israel has put him at odds with the more liberal wing of his party, as Democrats have grown increasingly willing to challenge Israel as its government has become more right-wing. Some Democrats have raised concerns or outright opposition to U. S. military support to Israel, pointing to its aggressive development of settlements in the occupied West Bank and its years-long punishing blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also formed the most far-right government in Israel\u2019s history, though that has been replaced since the attacks by a unity government that includes centrist parties.\n\nBiden has said Israel has a duty to respond to the attacks, which he has called as consequential as the Holocaust, but he seemed to impose limits when he said during a television interview airing Sunday that Israel reoccupying Gaza would be \u201ca big mistake.\u201d Israel captured the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war, but it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, leading to a Hamas takeover of the territory two years later.\n\n\u201cThis is a special moment where we would really encourage the Biden administration to weigh in with Netanyahu and say that we don\u2019t want to have an even greater humanitarian crisis right now,\u201d Schakowsky, who represents a district in Chicago and its northern suburbs with a significant Jewish population, said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about that.\u201d\n\nA White House summary of Biden\u2019s phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday said that Biden reiterated unwavering support for Israel but also that the two leaders  discussed U. S. coordination with the United Nations, as well as Egypt, Jordan, Israel and other countries to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care. \u201cPresident Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,\u201d the readout said.\n\nBiden and his top aides are focused on preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflagration and have repeatedly warned other actors, such as Iran, not to get involved. They are also concerned that anger in Arab countries whose citizens are highly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause could set off such a conflict, according to a senior administration official, who  spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.\n\n\u201cThey know an Israeli ground incursion that has really high casualties could inflame not just the situation among Palestinians but in the broader region,\u201d said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a genuine concern that the threat of Hamas needs to be eliminated \u2026 but at the same time, how do you make sure that innocent Palestinians aren\u2019t targeted?\u201d\n\n\u201cJ Street adamantly rejects the charge that it threatened endorsees,\u201d said the organization\u2019s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. \u201cOver the past 10 days, we\u2019ve spoken to many members of Congress to explain why support for Israel, condemnation of Hamas and recognition of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself are core values of the organization. We want those we support to hear how important it is to us that our partners stand up for Israel even as we also speak out on the crisis now facing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe conflict has inflamed tensions in more direct ways as well. Capitol Police last week had a meeting with nine progressive Democrats, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush, about their safety. A Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said the lawmakers are receiving significantly more threats than they have in the past. The meeting was put together by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N. Y.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.)."

    "description": "The trip to show support comes as Israel mourns victims of Hamas\u2019s attack and readies a Gaza invasion that some warn could devastate civilians.",
    "content": "Biden will also visit Jordan, where he plans to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has endured Israeli airstrikes that have killed more than 2,700 Palestinians.\n\nHamas has taken scores of hostages into Gaza, including an unknown number of Americans. Biden will work to get as much information about the hostage situation as possible during his trip, White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing with reporters Monday evening.\n\nKirby emphasized that the United States had not sought assurances that Israel would not launch its ground invasion while Biden was visiting the country. \u201cWe\u2019re not dictating terms or operational directions to the Israelis,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see escalation. We want to make sure humanitarian assistance begins to flow.\u201d\n\nStill, U. S. officials waited to announce Biden\u2019s travel to Israel on Monday night until they received commitments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a humanitarian package, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken received assurances during a marathon meeting in Tel Aviv this week and then made the announcement that Biden would be visiting.\n\nDuring the 7\u00bd-hour meeting, Israeli and U. S. officials set up separate rooms and passed papers between the two sides, negotiating over humanitarian issues including getting aid into Gaza and creating safe zones for Palestinian civilians, said a State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.\n\nThough Blinken hailed an agreement on humanitarian issues, his announcement included few details, probably an indication that differences remain between the two allies. The provision of humanitarian aid is sensitive in Israel, especially among far-right politicians tied to Netanyahu who have pressed him to wage a scorched-earth campaign in Gaza in response to the terrorist attack.\n\nThe White House is deeply concerned about the conflict spiraling into a broader regional conflagration, and Biden has warned other actors, particularly Iran, not to jump in. His visit to Israel could underline that message.\n\nOfficials are also worried that anger in Arab countries, where many citizens have deep sympathy for the Palestinian cause, could boil over and create pressure for their leaders to take action against Israel.\n\nBiden has repeatedly emphasized his support for Israel and said the country has a duty to respond to the horrific attack, in which Palestinian gunmen from Hamas breached Israel\u2019s sophisticated border fence in several places before hunting civilians in their homes and cars and shooting people indiscriminately.\n\nBut the president and his top aides have also sought to draw a distinction between Hamas and Palestinian civilians. In recent days, they have stressed their efforts to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow into Gaza and to secure a humanitarian corridor where Palestinian Americans can leave the densely populated enclave of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children.\n\nIsrael has said its goal is to eliminate Hamas and has urged more than 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza to avoid being in harm\u2019s way, an order the United Nations called impossible. It also announced a full siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks, cutting off food, fuel, electricity and water, which human rights groups have said violates international law.\n\nBiden spoke with Sisi on Monday, the White House said, and the two discussed \u201congoing efforts to alleviate the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the U. N., Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and other regional partners.\u201d\n\nEgypt has helped broker cease-fires between Israel and Palestine during past incursions and plays a critical role in ongoing efforts to secure humanitarian assistance. And on Egypt\u2019s border with Gaza, the Rafah crossing could be the only way out for Palestinians seeking to flee the enclave amid Israel\u2019s bombardment campaign.\n\nBlinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Sisi, Blinken said Rafah \u201cwill be opened\u201d so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave.\n\nBut there was confusion over the agreement and the crossing remained closed, deepening frustration and panic among aid groups, who warn that time is running out for wounded and displaced Gazans to receive critical \u2014 and, in many cases, lifesaving \u2014 supplies.\n\nThe planned trip to Israel is in some ways reminiscent of Biden\u2019s visit in February to Kyiv, as he was seeking to dramatically show his support for Ukraine. That trip, too, was aimed at showcasing Biden\u2019s personal support for an ally that had suffered a bloody attack, in Ukraine\u2019s case at the hands of Russia. That visit was kept secret until Biden\u2019s arrival."

    "content": "After the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s 75-year history, which claimed more than 1,200 lives, Israeli officials have vowed to cripple Hamas \u2014 the Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the assault. Israel\u2019s military says it has carried out more than 2,000 strikes across the territory since Saturday. More than 1,100 people have been killed, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nThe Washington Post mapped some of the most devastating strikes. Many were concentrated in heavily populated areas in the north.\n\nIsrael has pledged to focus its fire on Hamas fighters and abide by international law. Hamas said Wednesday that Israeli strikes targeted the head of its military wing, killing his brother. Two members of the group\u2019s political office were killed Tuesday.\n\nBut mosques, hospitals, residential buildings and international aid groups have also been hit. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that 13 health-care facilities were affected by the strikes. Nine U. N. staffers were killed in the strikes.\n\nGazans have lived under an Israeli blockade for 16 years. The 140-square-mile territory is among the most densely populated places on Earth. Of its 2 million people, about half are children \u2014 many have never been outside the strip.\n\nIsrael announced a complete siege of Gaza after the attacks. The country cut off power to the territory, leaving many residents in the dark. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials confirmed Gaza\u2019s sole power plant had run out of fuel. Access to water, sanitation facilities and health care will be affected by the outages, aid groups warned.\n\nAll crossings out of the enclave have been closed, leaving residents with nowhere to go.\n\nMore than 263,000 people are displaced across the strip, according to the U. N. Many have sought shelter in overcrowded U.N. schools. More than 1,000 housing units are estimated to have been destroyed.\n\nThe strikes are the beginning of what Israel has said will be its largest-ever offensive in Gaza, where people have already lived through multiple wars since Hamas seized power. Some 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up, the most in 50 years. Troops are massed on Gaza\u2019s border as Hamas continues to fire rockets into Israel."

The vast majority of the party has remained steadfastly behind Israel as it launches its retaliatory campaign for the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.\n\nBut a small yet growing number of Democrats have begun urging the Biden administration to do more to encourage Israel to limit civilian casualties in its counterattack and ensure that innocent Palestinians are able to receive basic needs and humanitarian assistance. The shifting dynamic could create political and diplomatic complications for Biden amid the announcement late Monday that he will visit Israel.\n\nBiden in recent days has aimed to strike a delicate balance between Israel\u2019s right to respond to a devastating event and the need to draw a distinction between Hamas and ordinary Palestinians.

    "description": "U.S. officials have not presented evidence that Tehran played a direct role in the massacre in Israel, but a bipartisan group is demanding action.",
    "content": "President Biden faces growing pressure from lawmakers in both parties to punish Iran after Hamas\u2019s massacre this month, as the administration tries to support Israel without expanding an already gruesome conflict in the Middle East. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.On Monday night, Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) sent a letter to the White House, signed by more than 110 lawmakers, demanding more aggressive financial sanctions on Iran, pointing to ties between Tehran and the militants who carried out the bloody attack on Israel. Backed by more than 60 House Democrats, the letter said the administration should block Iranian oil sales to other countries such as China, aiming to dry up one of the regime\u2019s key sources of funding.\n\nSo far, the White House has not adopted this approach, though its position could change quickly. Any dramatic move against Iran risks intensifying a regional conflict that the Biden administration wants to calm as much as possible, and restricting Iranian oil sales could send global gas prices skyward ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nHow the administration responds could hinge on what U. S. intelligence agencies ultimately conclude about Iran\u2019s role in Hamas\u2019s attack. U.S. officials previously told The Washington Post that Hamas received weapons and training from Iran, but produced no evidence linking Iran directly to the slaughter. Iran\u2019s foreign minister said Monday that \u201cpreemptive action\u201d against Israel from unspecified \u201cleaders of the Resistance\u201d could be expected and that \u201cwe cannot be indifferent to the war crimes committed against the people of Gaza.\u201d All 100 senators will be briefed about the Hamas attack and Israel\u2019s war in Gaza on Wednesday by senior administration officials.\n\n\u201cIran must be held fully accountable for its continued role in funding Hamas and Islamic terror,\u201d states the congressional letter, which praises Biden for his assistance to Israel thus far in the crisis. \u201cWe urge the Administration to take all necessary steps to cut off Iranian funding sources. This includes maximum enforcement of all U. S. sanctions, and taking any and all steps to end Iran\u2019s oil trade to China.\u201d\n\nIf the United States does decide to punish Iran, the country\u2019s oil revenue would pose an obvious target. (Already, U. S. officials and the Qatari government agreed last week to suspend a $6 billion humanitarian fund for nongovernmental organizations in Iran funded by Iranian oil sales, eliciting a rebuke from Tehran.) Iran is exporting around 1.5 million barrels of oil per day \u2014 the vast majority of it to China \u2014 in a major increase from the nearly 1 million barrels it was exporting per day at the start of Biden\u2019s term, according to Scott Modell, chief executive officer at the Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nThe White House already faces political headwinds from rising gas prices that could threaten Biden\u2019s reelection bid. A sanctions crackdown on Iran, if not offset by more oil from another source, could lead the price of oil to spike by more than $10 a barrel, probably bringing the average price of a gallon of gas from $3.66 to above $4, Modell said.\n\n\u201cIt would fly in the face of where the administration has been. The White House has wanted to keep Iranian oil flowing; they want to build on this working d\u00e9tente,\u201d said Modell, who also cautioned that price fluctuations would depend on how long oil traders expect new sanctions to remain in place. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about taking 500,000, or 1 million, barrels per day out, the market will react to that.\u201d\n\nOn the Senate floor Monday, top Republicans took repeated aim at the Biden administration\u2019s approach to Tehran. The GOP has been demanding a particularly hard line: Former president Donald Trump last week falsely blamed the Hamas attack on Biden\u2019s move to allow the $6 billion humanitarian fund, even though no money from the fund had been spent and it was limited to humanitarian purposes, with U. S. officials getting veto power over each transaction.\n\nIran is under one of the most restrictive U. S. sanctions programs in the world. An almost total economic embargo prevents international firms from doing business with Iranian financial institutions or importing Iranian-origin products, among myriad other economic activities. Further restrictions are likely to face resistance from many Democrats wary of inflaming the region further.\n\n\u201cAt this extremely delicate moment, it is in the U. S. interest to prevent the latest violence from escalating into a full-blown regional conflict,\u201d said one senior House Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe caucus dynamics. \u201cIt would be maddening if hawkish lawmakers with a long-standing goal of fomenting war with Iran succeed in pushing the U.S. into new sanctions and escalation with Iran on this totally fabricated pretext.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran is already under the heaviest sanction of any country in the world, and has been for a long time,\u201d said Duss, now executive vice president of the Center for International Policy, a D. C.-based think tank. \u201cPiling more sanctions on top of sanctions does not seem to be working, especially when there is such an enormous political cost to removing sanctions when Iran does things we want to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of sanctions introduced by Congress are duplicative,\u201d said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign policy think tank, who stressed he had not yet seen the current congressional proposals. \u201cThey have no real additional impact on Iran because the items in question are already under sanction. It can make the lawmakers look like they\u2019re doing something even if what they\u2019re doing is not new or impactful.\u201d"

    "content": "Trailing Trump by huge margins in the GOP presidential primary and running out of time to close the gap, DeSantis has taken an increasingly aggressive approach to his top rival. For months, wary of alienating Trump\u2019s loyal base, DeSantis criticized the former president only when asked and took subtler swings in his stump speeches. But his comments over the past week underscore a shift in posture this fall, with DeSantis routinely knocking Trump by name and sometimes broaching his character.\n\nDeSantis has always pitched himself to voters as a more effective, disciplined version of Trump \u2014 an heir to his agenda who is more likely to follow through, less toxic to swing voters and undistracted by personal drama. Now he\u2019s making that case more forcefully and seizing new opportunities to hit Trump as they arise, blasting the former president\u2019s comments of the day on issues ranging from the Israel-Gaza war to six-week abortion bans.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear the blunter approach will make a difference for DeSantis, who has fallen far behind Trump since launching his campaign in a more competitive standing and is now fighting for a distant second place with rivals. Polling and focus groups have repeatedly found that most attacks don\u2019t work on Trump and can even backfire as voters who like the former president react defensively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna say it in here if I get the opportunity,\u201d Kristine Willets, a retiree long torn between Trump and DeSantis, said before heading into Mario\u2019s Sports Bar & Grill with her grandson. \u201cStop doing that. We don\u2019t care about that.\u201d\n\nWillets came out of the event agreeing with some of DeSantis\u2019s objections: \u201cTrump should have fired [FBI director Chris] Wray,\u201d she said. She raved about DeSantis, declared him \u201cready\u201d to be president and praised his answer to her question about the war in Ukraine (\u201cWe need to end the conflict.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThink of the chaos that was going on in his term,\u201d Willets said. \u201cNo one ever had to put up with this stuff Trump put up with.\u201d\n\nDeSantis\u2019s presidential hopes likely rest on people like Willets: Trump voters in Iowa \u2014 where DeSantis has focused his resources \u2014 who are open to other options in 2024. So far, most Trump supporters have proved difficult to win over.\n\nDeSantis and his allies have sought to criticize Trump as both hard to elect in the general and insufficiently conservative on key issues in the primary \u2014 noting that he once allowed transgender women to compete in his Miss Universe pageant or that he didn\u2019t get rid of Anthony S. Fauci, who helped lead the U. S. coronavirus response under Trump and inspires hatred from many Republicans.\n\nRepublican candidates and groups aiming to defeat Trump have tried many lines of attack and DeSantis is no exception. Asked recently on the campaign trail why someone should vote for him over Trump \u2014 in a moment promoted on social media by a pro-DeSantis super PAC \u2014 the governor ticked swiftly through a list of arguments over five minutes, saying that he has a stronger record of fulfilling policy promises; can serve longer in office; and is more capable of staffing an effective administration.\n\nDeSantis\u2019s support among voters favorable to Trump has steadily dropped from a high point early this year, before he officially joined the presidential race. Many of those Republicans have gravitated back toward Trump as he racks up criminal indictments \u2014 and DeSantis himself has echoed Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that the prosecutions are politically motivated, mostly declining to criticize the former president on that front.\n\nAsked why DeSantis has sharpened his criticisms lately, campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo \u2014 who recently called Trump\u2019s comments on Israel \u201cdisturbing and disqualifying\u201d \u2014 said DeSantis \u201chas simply been pointing out how the former president isn\u2019t the same guy as he used to be\u201d and responding to off-script blunders.\n\nAt first, DeSantis avoided criticizing Trump to the point that even veiled jabs made news. In March, when Trump was indicted in New York, DeSantis made headlines for his pointed allusion to the sordid allegations against Trump \u2014 \u201chush money to a porn star\u201d \u2014 even as he joined broad GOP condemnations of the case.\n\nBut they were less frequent and DeSantis advisers said their priority was introducing DeSantis positively rather than aggressively contrasting with Trump. And DeSantis didn\u2019t criticize Trump by name in his stump speeches, which usually decried a \u201cculture of losing\u201d in the GOP.\n\n\u201cWe have the Donald Trump on the teleprompter, where he\u2019s reading what\u2019s on there,\u201d DeSantis told reporters in New Hampshire last week. \u201cThen you have Donald Trump when he gets off that teleprompter, and that\u2019s the real Donald Trump.\u201d He accused Trump of making the conflict in Israel \u201cabout him\u201d with his criticisms of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."

    "description": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider, more devastating Middle East conflict are growing as clashes with Hezbollah intensify amid warnings from Tehran.",
    "content": "Fears that the Gaza war could trigger a wider and more devastating Middle East war are growing as clashes with Iranian-backed Hezbollah intensify along Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon and Israel presses ahead with its plans for a ground incursion into Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas. The fears spiked on Tuesday following a strike on a Gaza hospital that appears to have killed hundreds of people, triggering angry denunciations and calls for vengeance across the region. Demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank, marched to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and converged on Israeli diplomatic missions in Turkey and Jordan, blaming the strike on Israel, which has denied responsibility.\n\nThe bloodshed fueled already rising tensions between Israel and Iran, which backs Hamas along with an array of allied militias and proxies. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned before the strike that Iran\u2019s militia allies in the \u201cresistance front\u201d could take what he called \u201cpreemptive action\u201d to deter an Israeli ground offensive, and the risk is high that an incident such as this could prompt escalatory attacks in revenge. \u201cWe have to retaliate from Lebanon,\u201d the demonstrators chanted in Beirut.\n\nOver the past decade, Iran has built up a formidable array of militias and proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in addition to Hamas, and all or any of them could be called on to open up new fronts. Iran also has to calculate whether it can afford to expend the considerable military leverage it derives from these allies in a potentially ruinous conflict for the purpose of defending one of them, Hamas, in Gaza.\n\nWashington has positioned two aircraft carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah, and could also be drawn into the fight if Hezbollah launches a full-scale assault on Israel. Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah forces there, would almost certainly join in; there have already been exchanges of fire along the Syrian border, and activists report that Iranian-allied fighters have been relocating to southern Syria from the east of the country.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, is the well-armed, battle-trained and highly disciplined Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, said Michael Horowitz, director of intelligence at Le Beck security consultancy. Hezbollah has amassed between 130,000 and 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, some of which could reach deep into Israeli cities or be used to deliver precision strikes against Israeli military facilities such as air bases, curtailing Israel\u2019s fighting capabilities.\n\nBut Israel probably would also inflict massive damage on Lebanon, as it did in the 2006 war and the 1982 invasion of the country. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon that \u201cthe price you will pay will be far heavier\u201d than in any previous war.\n\nIt appears the Iranians do not want an escalation and are keen to find ways to avoid one, according to a regional diplomat familiar with some of the Iranian conversations with that nation\u2019s allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. While making it clear that their allies are prepared to fight, Iran and Hezbollah have not publicly set red lines for what scenario in Gaza would trigger their involvement \u2014 which could range from continued attacks on Gaza, the launch of a ground invasion or only in the event that Hamas is at risk of being completely defeated, the diplomat said.\n\nA senior Hamas official, speaking from Beirut, insisted that Iran was not involved in the Hamas assault, in which at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed and nearly 200 taken hostage. He said Hamas had not anticipated the scale and speed of the collapse of Israel\u2019s defenses and that Hamas was caught off guard also by the ferocity of Israel\u2019s response; over 3,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli airstrikes, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\n\u201cOf course the Iranians help us and train us and give us support, but this operation specifically was very confidential and secret,\u201d said Ali Barakah, who heads Hamas\u2019s international relations department. He described what he said was intended as a \u201climited operation\u201d to trade Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners and said the expectation was that Israel would conduct limited airstrikes against Gaza before embarking on negotiations.\n\nBuilt up over decades since the creation of Hezbollah in 1982, the strategy aims to position enough militia firepower on Israel\u2019s borders to deter an Israeli attack on Iran, a long-standing fear that has grown in recent years as Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. The Palestinian cause is central to the strategy and to Iran\u2019s identity as a revolutionary Islamic state.\n\nOver the past two years, Iran has sought to reinforce the strategy with a concept known as \u201cunity of fronts,\u201d under which Hezbollah, Hamas and other regional allies have pledged closer cooperation and mutual defense, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah and Hamas have set up a joint coordination center in Beirut with a view to collaborating in ways that further deter Israel from attacks on any one of them.\n\nIran almost certainly doesn\u2019t want to risk undermining Hezbollah\u2019s deterrent capabilities for the sake of Gaza, but at the same time it can\u2019t afford to be seen as abandoning its allies if the deterrence is to survive, Knights said."

    "description": "GOP rival Ron DeSantis criticized the remark as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
    "content": "\u201c[I]t is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as \u2018very smart,\u2019\u201d said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung defended the former president\u2019s comments as meant to criticize unspecified U. S. officials for giving Hezbollah the idea to attack from the north. He said Trump was referring to a briefing by a senior U.S. defense official on Monday that expressed concern about Hezbollah opening a second front. In fact, Hezbollah started bombardments a day earlier, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was clearly pointing out how incompetent Biden and his administration were by telegraphing to the terrorists an area that is susceptible to an attack,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cSmart does not equal good.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely lost on us why any American would ever praise an Iran-backed terrorist organization as \u2018smart.\u2019 Or have any objection to the United States warning terrorists not to attack Israel,\u201d deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates said. \u201cThis is a time for all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel against \u2018unadulterated evil.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is reckless and irresponsible for Trump to have made negative comments about Israel \u2014 this is a time for unified support, not irrelevant comments that could give succor to Israel\u2019s enemies,\u201d Klein said. \u201cI\u2019m so ashamed of what he said. How does he expect support from people who care about Israel after making statements like this?\u201d\n\nHis remarks also drew a rebuke Thursday from the Israeli government\u2019s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi. \u201cShameful that a man like that, a former U. S. president, abets propaganda and disseminates things that wound the spirit of Israel\u2019s fighters and its citizens,\u201d Karhi told the country\u2019s Channel 13. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to bother with him and the nonsense he spouts.\u201d\n\nIn a New Hampshire town hall hosted by Gannett on Thursday, former U. N. ambassador Nikki Haley called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cdangerous,\u201d saying that this is what she refers to when she says her party needs to chart a new path forward.\n\nEven as Trump made his remark about Hezbollah, he acknowledged that it could be controversial, immediately adding, \u201cThe press doesn\u2019t like when they say it.\u201d He went on to repeat that he views Xi as a \u201cvery smart man\u201d because \u201c1.4 billion people, he controls it with an iron fist.\u201d\n\nIn a speech Wednesday delivered to an auditorium of supporters in West Palm Beach, Fla., Trump elaborated that he had \u201ca bad experience with Israel as president,\u201d telling a story about the U. S. operation to assassinate Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. In Trump\u2019s account, Israeli intelligence helped the United States locate Soleimani and plan the drone strike that killed him, but on the eve of the operation withdrew its participation.\n\nThe accuracy of Trump\u2019s account could not immediately be confirmed. At the time of the assassination, the Israeli government reacted with restraint to avoid fanning tensions with Iran. In 2021, a retired Israeli military officer acknowledged that his country\u2019s intelligence contributed to the U. S. airstrike.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing,\u201d Trump said in Wednesday\u2019s speech. \u201cSo we were disappointed by that. Very disappointed. But we did the job ourself. It was absolute precision, magnificent, beautiful job. And then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That didn\u2019t make me feel too good. But that\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\nAs Trump told the story, he suggested that he was recounting it publicly for the first time and that it possibly included classified information. He was indicted earlier this year by special counsel Jack Smith on 40 counts arising from allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House."

    "content": "Return to menu\n\nThe Ottoman Empire had controlled that part of the Middle East from the early 16th century until control of most of the region was granted to the British after World War I.\n\nBoth Israelis and Palestinians were struggling for self-determination and sovereignty over the territory, developing respective movements for their causes.\n\nAs World War I began, several controversial diplomatic efforts \u2014 some contradicting each other \u2014 by the Great Powers tried to shape the map of the modern Middle East, including the Palestinian territories. Palestinians cite a series of letters in 1915 to 1916 between Mecca\u2019s emir and the British high commissioner in Egypt, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, as outlining a promise of an independent Arab state.\n\nIn 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly negotiated between Britain and France planned to carve up the Middle East into spheres of influence, and determined that the land in question was to be internationalized.\n\nIn 1917, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, expressed his government\u2019s support for \u201cthe establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\u201d in a letter to Baron Walter Rothschild, the head of the British wing of the influential European Jewish banking family.\n\nTo Israelis, the missive marks a formal utterance of the Israeli state\u2019s right to exist; to Palestinians, it was an early sign of their dispossession. The declaration also noted that it was \u201cclearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,\u201d nodding to the overwhelming majority Arab population in the region at the time. (About 90 percent of the population was Muslim in 1850, and about 80 percent in 1914.)\n\nLarge-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Both sides continued to assert their right to establish a state."

    "description": "In recent years, Hamas made moves that led some observers to believe the threat to Israel was contained. They were wrong.",
    "content": "Longtime observers of Hamas debate how much the Palestinian militant group truly evolved over the last decade, particularly during the period sometimes known as its \u201cpragmatic era.\u201d There is no argument, however, about when that era ended: Just after sunrise Saturday with the launch of a devastating attack on Israel. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics.Since it seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, Hamas, while steadfast in its rejection of Israel\u2019s right to exist as a state, nevertheless had made small overtures, analysts say, such as signaling support for a long-term cease-fire and opening diplomatic back channels. As the years ticked by, some Middle East analysts even began speaking of Hamas as \u201ccontained,\u201d though they reserved skepticism for the militants they knew as among the most strategic and protean in the region.\n\nThen came the eventual \u2014 many would say inevitable \u2014 break from that position last weekend with a Hamas operation that stunned the world in its brazenness and brutality. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 100 were captured as hostages. The atrocities inflicted upon civilians, including children, analysts said, signals a dark new chapter for a group that likes to boast of striking Israeli military and police targets, distinguishing its conduct from the bloodlust of Islamic State extremists.\n\nThat\u2019s the question researchers and policymakers who for years have monitored Hamas are trying to answer as they revisit the group\u2019s trajectory to understand the motivations for an attack so extraordinary in its scope and lethality that Hamas surely realized it was risking its own annihilation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to \u201ccleanse\u201d the area of Hamas in a war of vengeance whose toll on the militants \u201cwill reverberate with them for generations.\u201d\n\nHamas\u2019s official line is that the attack was in response to Israel\u2019s long-running blockade and violence against Palestinians, but researchers said a host of other factors shaped the timing and methods. They also cautioned that the conflict remains fluid, with little verified information about the genesis of the operation and whether Hamas had help from Iran or other regional backers to execute it.\n\nAnother factor is the internal Israeli political crisis. Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition government has continued apace with settlement construction while pushing controversial judicial overhauls that would hobble the courts\u2019 role as a check on executive power. With thousands of Israelis protesting in the streets, analysts said Hamas may have seen the Israeli state in a vulnerable position and Palestinian voices once again sidelined in a political fight that could shape their future.\n\nAmid the chaos, a group of Islamist militants saw an opening. They issued leaflets offering themselves as an alternative to both oppression by Israel and corruption from mainstream Palestinian leaders. Founders of the group, a Muslim Brotherhood spinoff that came to be known as Hamas, \u201cviewed the intifada as an opportune time to leverage all the preparation that had been taking place clandestinely for years\u201d to create an Islamist resistance movement, Baconi wrote in his book.\n\nLike other Islamist groups, Hamas initially gained popularity among Palestinians by creating local charities and programs to tackle health care and education. That translated into political power in 2006 when the Hamas bloc known as \u201cChange and Reform\u201d won legislative elections, posing an existential threat to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority. As in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere, the White House had pushed for elections, then balked when voters picked militant Islamists over secular leaders who were seen as ineffectual and beholden to Western interests.\n\nLigon said Hamas stood out among regional militants because its leaders put a premium on enlisting recruits with military skill and technological expertise, \u201cnot just guys that were willing to fight and die for the cause.\u201d She said Hamas fighters looked back at the history of World War I tunnellers as they dug their own underground warrens to circumvent the blockade. They also looked forward, she said, encouraging innovation."

She was frantically packing a bag so she could flee south, she said, perhaps by foot, because she had no car.\n\nIsrael on Friday urged more than a million residents to evacuate northern Gaza, including Gaza City, where Israeli strikes have wiped out families and laid waste to its once-bustling commercial center. The warning prompted a chaotic exodus along treacherous routes to the south, where at least one convoy was bombed on Friday, according to video footage verified by The Washington Post.\n\nThe Israeli military said Sunday that it would \u201cnot carry out any operations\u201d along a stretch of the main road that runs the length of the Gaza Strip. \u201cYour safety and that of your families matters,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces said in a message shared on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAn estimated 1 million residents are displaced inside Gaza, according to UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees. Residents said Sunday that they did not trust Israel\u2019s assurances that it would refrain from military operations on the road out of Gaza City.\n\nThe ministry also issued an \u201curgent appeal\u201d for countries to send medical delegations to help treat the wounded. It said medical workers in Gaza are among those who have been killed, injured and displaced.\n\nAt Gaza\u2019s overwhelmed hospitals, doctors said they were moving patients to the floor to make room for the newly injured, while bodies piled up outside. At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the territory\u2019s largest medical complex, about 30,000 people crowded into the buildings and surrounding parking lot, in the hopes it would keep them safe.\n\nAccording to several residents, some families were debating whether to stay all in one room, so that they would die together in the event of a strike, or to spread the children out in different homes and in convoys heading south. That way, they said, at least some members of the family might survive.\n\nIsrael has vowed to \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas and its senior leadership in Gaza, where it said it was preparing for a \u201cwide range\u201d of offensive plans, including a possible ground invasion. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 \u2014 and the enclave is one of two territories, including the occupied West Bank, that Palestinians envisioned as part of a future state.\n\nHumanitarian aid piled up in Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, which borders Gaza, and residents flocked to the Rafah crossing in the south. But the border remained closed, despite reports that it would open to allow the evacuation of foreign nationals, including U. S. citizens.\n\nAhmed, who declined to give his full name for security reasons, fled his home near the border in southeastern Gaza, along with his wife and three children. First, they moved to the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood, but they had to flee again as the strikes intensified. Now they are staying at a UNRWA storage facility in Rafah city.\n\nIn Khan Younis on Friday, an Israeli strike hit the home where members of the Ola family had fled. It killed at least 10 members of the family, including Toqa Abu al-Ola, who was eight months pregnant. Ola\u2019s 3-year-old son, Issam, was the only survivor, according to his uncle, Issam Abu Youssef.\n\n\u201cI swear to you: Death is easier than what we are experiencing,\u201d said Haneen Abu Youssef, the child\u2019s aunt. \u201cWhen you see a child like this, who lost his mother, father, uncle, grandmother and grandfather, the whole family, uncles and aunts. Nothing is left.\u201d"

    "description": "\u201cWe must not lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas\u2019s appalling attacks,\u201d President Biden said Sunday.",
    "content": "That emphasis represented a shift for the Biden administration, which has given blanket support to Israel\u2019s military operations in advance of a ground invasion that human rights groups say will result in large-scale civilian casualties. But there was little sign Sunday of any substantive steps toward easing the situation in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israeli soldiers were \u201cready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.\u201d\n\nAs Secretary of State Antony Blinken touched down in Egypt on Sunday, relief supplies sat at an airport in Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, less than an hour\u2019s drive from the border with Gaza. Some of the aid supplies \u2014 delivered by regional countries such as Turkey, as well as the United Nations \u2014 have been stranded on Egypt\u2019s side of the border for days.\n\nDiplomats and others familiar with the discussions said one of the main obstacles to the delivery of that aid is the Israeli government\u2019s refusal to guarantee that it will not bomb relief trucks. One diplomatic official said negotiations were underway to allow Israel to inspect trucks entering Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on all parties to open the humanitarian corridor \u2014 to have a humanitarian pause in the conflict and to open the border, to allow supplies to go into children who need them right now,\u201d Jeremy Hopkins, Egypt representative for UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nTouma said her agency had not been able to confirm that water, or some water, had been restored. Gaza receives water through a variety of sources, aside from the public water network, including from private vendors. Desalination plants and pumping stations require fuel, which Israel was still blocking.\n\nOther diplomats were less optimistic than the Biden administration that progress was being made on the humanitarian front. \u201cGaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies\u201d even as aid stockpiled in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel itself could be \u201cdispatched with hours,\u201d U. N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a late afternoon statement. \u201cWe are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,\u201d he said, and neither the hostages being held by Hamas nor humanitarian aid to Gaza \u201cshould become bargaining chips.\u201d\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 2,600 people. Israel also warned more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, an order human rights groups have called impossible.\n\nBiden also said in the interview that Hamas needs to be eliminated entirely but that there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. But the president said he did not think Israel would pursue that path right now.\n\nIt said it shut access to an \u201carea up to four kilometers from the northern border with Lebanon\u201d on Sunday morning in response to an \u201cincident\u201d in northern Israel. It asked residents not to enter or approach the area and warned that GPS signals would be restricted."

    "description": "A flood of misinformation in the Israel-Gaza war is shaping how panicked citizens and a global public view the conflict with Hamas.",
    "content": "Posts, videos and memes falsely claim that the attack stemmed from collusion between Hamas and Israel. In the 24 hours after the Hamas attack, the hashtag \u201cTraitorsFromWithin\u201d became the top trend on X, formerly Twitter, in Hebrew. Some threads posited that workers who were Palestinian citizens of Israel were stationed at the border fence, while others claimed the attack was orchestrated to push a peace deal with Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne viral TikTok video featured a woman who identified herself as a former soldier on the Gaza Strip. She claimed that the border was so tightly controlled that even \u201ca cockroach\u201d would have been detected in advance \u2014 a description many commenters took to mean that Israel would have had to have aided Hamas in penetrating it.\n\nHamas and its supporters have taken advantage of Israel\u2019s disunity: On Monday a pro-Hamas account called Gaza Now shared an image suggesting that former left-wing Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was fleeing the country. The image was undated and showed him in the baggage claim at an airport. The Gaza Now account had picked it up from a Jewish Israeli influencer who supports the far-right government of Netanyahu, and had shared the content to criticize Israel\u2019s left. The influencer ultimately issued an apology on X.\n\nA Palestinian digital rights organization called 7amleh says it has detected more than 19,000 cases of hate speech and violent incitement against Palestinians in the Hebrew language on X since Oct. 7, the first day of escalations. The organization\u2019s executive director, Nadim Nashif, said he wasn\u2019t able to flag the content to X because the organization\u2019s former points of contact at the company had been fired by Elon Musk, who has dramatically shrunk the company\u2019s workforce since he took ownership last year.\n\nBut over the past year, tech companies\u2019 abilities to field these complaints has been compromised by waves of layoffs in units responsible for policing problematic content. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has laid off many members of a global operations team that monitors the platform, including Arabic speakers, according to a person familiar with the layoffs who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them. Under the leadership of Musk, X has fired the teams that acted as point people on the ground for advocates in the region. On Wednesday the European Union announced a probe into X for failures to moderate potentially illegal content and disinformation on its service.\n\nSchatz said there is little communication from Meta-owned WhatsApp because the messaging platform is viewed as a private, encrypted service. And at X, he echoed Nashif\u2019s account that, over the last year, \u201cthere has been no one to talk to\u201d due to the firings. He said the company had reached out for the first time this week."

    "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 A Reuters videographer was killed and six other journalists were wounded Friday in southern Lebanon when the area they were reporting from was struck by Israeli shelling, according to two colleagues who spoke to the injured journalists in the hospital, as well as an eyewitness. Charbel Francis, a cameraman for Al Araby TV, said he was filming a barrage of Israeli shelling on a hill, while standing about 50 feet from the other journalists, when the strike landed. The battle was in the distance, and there was no indication that fire from Lebanon was coming from anywhere near the journalists.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed,\u201d a Reuters statement read, adding that Abdallah was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon providing live coverage of skirmishes along the border. Two other Reuters journalists, Thaer al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh, \u201csustained injuries and are seeking medical care,\u201d the news agency said.\n\nThe statement did not specify who was responsible. Reuters later reported, citing one of its journalists who was at the scene, that missiles \u201cfired from the direction of Israel\" struck the group.\n\nA spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said Saturday that it was \"very sorry\u201d for the journalist\u2019s death but that it was not sure who was responsible and that Israel would investigate.\n\nAl Jazeera said the journalists had all gathered in one area for safety in Alma al-Chaab, a village in south Lebanon. In video posted earlier on Friday by AFP journalist Christina Assi, who was among the injured, several reporters could be seen wearing blue bullet-resistant vests marked with the word \u201cPress.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press \u2014 which had a photographer on the scene \u2014 reported that an Israeli shell landed near the group during an exchange of fire with Hezbollah. The area had previously been a target of Israeli strikes, according to a Lebanese security source cited by AFP.\n\nReporters Without Borders said Abdallah was \u201ckilled by an Israeli strike while covering the situation on the southern border\u201d in Lebanon. The press advocacy group described it as a \u201cheinous crime against journalists\u201d and said it was \u201ccontinuing its investigations into the circumstances of this tragedy.\u201d\n\nAl Jazeera said in a statement that its broadcast vehicle was \u201ccompletely burned,\u201d adding it holds Israel \"responsible for this brutal attack and calls on the international community to take action to ensure the safety of journalists.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a mission set up in 1978 to monitor the border between Lebanon and Israel, said in a statement posted on social media that a \u201cheavy exchange of fire\u201d erupted in the area beginning at 5:20 p.m. Live footage carried on several news channels showed what appeared to be sustained shelling into Lebanese territory that lasted for about an hour.\n\nA live stream from the area showed the hillside as the blast hit. A woman is heard screaming \u201cI can\u2019t feel my legs\u201d before the feed is cut. Lebanese television broadcasts showed a woman in a press vest writhing on the ground, with fire billowing and a car burning in the background.\n\nAbdallah, 37, a video journalist based in Beirut, had covered conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and other major stories, including earthquakes that devastated southern Turkey this year. A wide circle of colleagues, friends and admirers posted tributes to Abdallah on social media Friday, and held a vigil for him in Beirut.\n\n\u201cHe was genuinely one of the most kind and heartwarming people one could know. Totally selfless, a bundle of laughs and an extremely kind individual,\u201d said Tariq Keblaoui, who said that a few weeks ago, Abdallah had helped him escape a protest that was being attacked.\n\nColleagues also remembered him as a \u201cbrave friend\u201d and some journalists recounted during a funeral procession held for him on Saturday that he often told them there was \u201cno story worth your life.\u201d"

    "content": "Blinken stood beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who offered his gratitude to Blinken and the American public for its \u201cincredible support for Israel in our war against the barbarians of Hamas.\u201d\n\nThe top U. S. diplomat is on a multicountry swing through the Middle East in an effort to manage the swirling crisis as Israel vows to annihilate Hamas in response to the group\u2019s devastating assault on Israeli communities.\n\nGaza will not receive water or electricity until hostages are set free, Israel\u2019s Energy Minister Israel Katz said Thursday. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, this past weekend is believed to have taken more than 100 hostages from Israel over the border. Their fate remains unclear.\n\nOn his visit, Blinken brought one of his top aides for hostage negotiations, Steven Gillen, who will remain in Israel to keep working to free the U. S. hostages, Blinken told reporters at a news conference.\n\nAt least 25 Americans have been killed following Hamas\u2019s assault on Saturday, said Blinken, but U. S. officials have declined to say how many Americans have been taken hostage.\n\nDuring his visit, Blinken met Lior Gelbaum, 24, a dual U. S.-Israeli citizen who survived the dance rave in southern Israel that was attacked by Hamas militants. In an emotional exchange, Gelbaum told Blinken it was a \u201cmiracle\u201d she survived, and urged the United States and Israel to focus on saving the hostages.\n\nBlinken said the Biden administration is also in conversations with the Israelis and Egyptians to provide safe passage to civilians in Gaza before a widely expected Israeli ground invasion of the enclave.\n\nThe densely populated Gaza Strip relies on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Severing gas and power from the territory could leave many residents without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care.\n\nEgypt urged Israel to refrain from targeting the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing \u2014 the only entry into Gaza not controlled by Israel \u2014 with airstrikes so it could be reopened for deliveries of food, water and emergency services.\n\n\u201cYou may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cWe will always be there by your side.\u201d\n\nBlinken assured Israelis that there was bipartisan support for Israel in the U. S. Congress, which is preparing to approve more military aid to Israel amid competing demands for aid to Taiwan, Ukraine and the U.S. southern border.\n\n\u201cWe democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard, even when it\u2019s difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said he showed Blinken graphic images of babies allegedly mutilated and burned by Hamas. U. S. officials said they were not in a position to authenticate the images, but Blinken described what he saw in the pictures as \u201cdepravity in the worst imaginable way.\u201d\n\nU. S. officials are also working to provide safe passage to some of the estimated 500 to 600 Palestinian American residents of Gaza who are seeking to flee, said a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.\n\nBlinken did not confirm or deny a Washington Post report that the United States and Qatar have quietly agreed not to allow the release in the near term of Iranian oil revenue held in Doha. \u201cWe have strict oversight of the funds and we retain the right to freeze them,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nFollowing his lighting round of meetings on Thursday, Blinken will fly to Jordan to meet King Abdullah II and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. He also plans to travel to Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia \u2014 continuing to urge countries with diplomatic relations with Hezbollah, Iran and the Palestinians in the West Bank to persuade them to stay out of the conflict."

In Israel and Gaza, people brace for a long and costly war\u201cNo power, no food, no gas,\u201d Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. \u201cWe are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.\u201d Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, orchestrated the ambush over the weekend, when militants took more than 100 hostages to Gaza.\n\nIsrael has bombarded the densely populated enclave in retaliation, killing at least 1,100 people. On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that the border with Gaza was secured and that it was preparing for an offensive.\n\nThe Gaza Strip, a 140-square-mile stretch of land with more than 2 million people, depends on Israel for most of its electricity and other basic services. Cutting off gas and power from the territory could leave many residents not only without power, but without clean drinking water, proper sanitation and health care. On Wednesday, Palestinian authorities said Gaza\u2019s only power plant has run out of fuel and stopped operating.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the siege Monday. \u201cThe humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIsrael provides Gaza with power in two ways. Gaza\u2019s sole power plant is operated by diesel fuel, which enters Gaza from the Karem Shalom crossing. There are also 10 direct power lines from Israel to Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli siege could also \u201cresult in a severe shortage of already scarce drinkable water,\u201d the United Nations said. The territory has several major desalination plants, which transform water from the Mediterranean Sea into drinkable water, but they need power to operate.\n\nSanitation facilities, too, could be crippled by the outages, increasing concerns about disease. Past fuel shortages in Gaza have caused sewage from the strip to contaminate agricultural land and spill into Israel.\n\nGaza \u201cwas on the edge of a humanitarian crisis for a very long time,\u201d said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East regional director of Mercy Corps. \u201cSo this additional shock is going to turn this into a full-blown crisis very quickly.\u201d\n\nIsrael withdrew its civilian population and military forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but has continued to control the flow of goods and people. When Hamas assumed political power of the territory in 2007, Israel imposed an air and sea blockade, which is also enforced by Egypt to the south.\n\nOver the course of the 16-year blockade, Israel has imposed shutdowns during key moments in the conflict, including Operation Cast Lead, which began in December 2008, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014. Those military campaigns killed more than 3,500 Palestinians in total.\n\n\u201cIsrael used its control over the access to goods and infrastructure needs as a way of creating a carrot-and-stick approach to the governing body in Gaza, Hamas,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf things are calm, things are opened up. If things get tense, Israel shuts the spigot.\u201d\n\nThe siege could also affect hospitals, which can run on generators but need fuel to power them. Several health-care facilities were already hit by Israeli strikes.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned to see that medical facilities have not been spared,\u201d L\u00e9o Cans, Doctors Without Borders\u2019 head of mission in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement. \u201c[An] airstrike destroyed an ambulance carrying the wounded, right in front of the hospital where we work.\u201d\n\nIsrael has justified its overwhelming use of force by saying it must destroy Hamas\u2019s military capabilities to prevent any future assaults on the country."

    "content": "The main roads running north to south were crowded for a second day Saturday after the Israeli military announced a six-hour window for civilians to move along designated streets to parts of Gaza south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands here. In some areas traffic came to a standstill with trucks, buses, overpacked cars and people on foot all crowding on to the same narrow roads to head south.\n\n\u201cI am definitely afraid, very afraid, but I will not risk the lives of my wife and children on the way to the south,\u201d he said, referring to reports that some of those fleeing were killed in an airstrike. \u201cLet us die inside our homes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe road is dangerous.\u201d\n\nRawan Abu Hamda, 41, also from Gaza City, started out on an evacuation route but quickly returned home after hearing reports of a strike that hit civilians on the road. She said hundreds of other families have also stayed in her neighborhood, many sheltering near al-Shifa hospital, in hopes the building won\u2019t be hit by airstrikes \u2014 although the ceiling of the nursery department collapsed on Oct. 9 after shelling nearby.\n\nReports emerged Friday of a strike on cars packed with fleeing civilians. The Washington Post verified a graphic video of the aftermath recorded along Salah Al-Deen Road. The video shows bodies, including several young children, strewn along the road as black smoke rises from vehicles engulfed in flames. On the north-facing side of the road, bodies are laid out amid personal belongings, including a bicycle, on flatbed trailers attached to a truck.\n\n\u201cWe had no choice, we have kids, they sent us papers that said \u2018you must move or you will be responsible for what may happen,\u2019\u201d she said, speaking to The Post through a messaging app because cellphone signals in the area were too weak to make calls.\n\nThe evacuation orders appear to signal that Israel plans to significantly escalate its war against Hamas ahead of, or in tandem with, an expected ground invasion. But human rights groups and aid organizations are warning that civilians must continue to be protected, regardless of the orders to move out.\n\nThe hospital is providing care to a \u201clarge number\u201d of patients, including children in incubators, and people in the intensive care unit, the Red Crescent said in a statement. The group said tens of thousands of civilians remain in the area and hundreds of people are also sheltering at or near the hospital.\n\nWith the conflict entering its second week, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said that 2 million people in Gaza are now at risk of running out of water. \u201cIt has become a matter of life and death,\u201d the agency said in a statement Saturday."

He had been stabbed 26 times, the Will County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement. Shahin, 32, was stabbed at least a dozen times and remains hospitalized in serious condition, the family said.\n\nWhen authorities arrived, Czuba was sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration to his forehead, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. He was taken to a hospital for treatment but did not make any statements to detectives when later questioned, the sheriff\u2019s office added.\n\nPresident Biden said in a statement that he was \u201csickened\u201d to hear of the deadly attack in Illinois, which \u201cstands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.\u201d\n\nBefore the service, speakers implored elected officials and members of the news media to employ greater caution, compassion and clarity in the days ahead because their roles are pivotal in fostering an environment that can give way to hate crimes. Speakers demanded an apology from President Biden for claiming to have seen photos of alleged Hamas-driven atrocities that his administration later clarified he had not seen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more than just a man that stabbed a 6-year-old boy here,\u201d Imam Omar Suleiman said. \u201cI want you to think about what was in his head. What type of hate has to be manufactured in the head of a man for him to stand over a 6-year-old boy and stab him 26 times?\u201d\n\nThe brutality of the latest outbreak of warfare has unleashed language from all sides that is so hateful and dehumanizing that it has shocked even longtime observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. International peace activists repeatedly have warned that the ugly rhetoric could inspire violent retaliations in the United States, citing dark precedents such as the targeting of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the increase in antisemitic incidents after previous flare-ups involving Israel.\n\nIn the past few days, Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups have documented vandalism or bomb threats at synagogues and mosques, along with hateful messages and swastikas scrawled in their communities. Arab and Muslim rights groups say they have fielded calls from people reporting that they have been fired or silenced for expressing pro-Palestinian views.\n\nAuthorities gave few details about Czuba. As news of his arrest spread, people who live nearby said in community forums on Facebook that Czuba had long alarmed residents with yard signs telegraphing his \u201cextreme\u201d views. One woman wrote that she had alerted local officials about the \u201cunhinged\u201d man. The Post contacted the woman seeking details but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nWadea was born in the United States to Palestinian parents who moved here more than a decade ago and have since divorced. The extended family, which has roots in both the West Bank and Gaza, already was reeling this week from the perils faced by relatives who are fleeing the Israeli siege and retaliatory strikes that followed the Hamas-led attack. Hannon said they never imagined that the tentacles of war would stretch all the way to the Chicago suburbs."

    "description": "Despite reports of a deal to let dual nationals out and aid into Gaza, Israel and Hamas announced that there would be no cease-fire, dashing the hopes of hundreds.",
    "content": "U. S. officials said they were attempting to create safe zones and limit civilian casualties, while also trying to deter Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from entering the conflict, using diplomatic back channels to warn adversaries against opening a new front. The Pentagon is sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East. Biden will arrive in Israel as early on Wednesday, Blinken said late Monday, offering a high-stakes demonstration of support for its ally.\n\nBlinken then joined a meeting of Israel\u2019s war cabinet when the country\u2019s commercial capital came under rocket fire. The meeting, which stretched for more than seven hours, was one of several the secretary has had during his second visit to the Jewish state in the span of four days aimed at conveying Washington\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nEarlier, Blinken sought to negotiate a deal to open the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, to allow much-needed aid in and foreigners and dual nationals out. Following his meeting Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Blinken said Rafah \u201cwill be opened\u201d so that hundreds of U. S. citizens could have the chance to leave. He added that the United States was in talks with the United Nations, Egypt, Israel and others to agree on a mechanism to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on the Palestinian side of the gate Monday in anticipation of the border reopening, television footage from the crossing showed. Palestinians who have been waiting for days on the Egyptian side of the border to cross back to their families in Gaza piled into buses on Monday to wait, according to Ahmed Salem, head of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, which has a team monitoring the border.\n\n\u201cIf we run out of fuel, then we will lose all of the patients in the ICU, the babies in the incubators, and the patients who need surgery,\u201d said a doctor at the hospital, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety.\n\nOne resident, Mohamed Youssef Abutaha, described through tears how he had been stocking up on groceries with his son and his sister Monday morning when an Israeli airstrike slammed into the street up ahead of them. \u201cIt fell in the sand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it had hit the building, we would instantly have died.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a U. S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public, said that the Pentagon had issued prepare-to-deploy orders this week for roughly 2,000 service members as part of the Biden administration\u2019s evolving response to the crisis in the Middle East \u2014 essentially shortening the time period in which that personnel must be ready to deploy if military leaders make that decision.\n\nIn Israel, the director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, said in an all-staff memo published Monday that he took responsibility for failing to thwart the attack by Hamas militants. The brazen, multipronged assault in southern Israel sent shock waves across the country, puncturing the widespread view among Israelis that the nation\u2019s extensive surveillance apparatus would detect plans for an attack before it was carried out.\n\nIn Gaza, about 200 to 250 Israeli captives are also being held, the spokesman for Hamas\u2019s armed wing said in an audio recording Monday, which was broadcast by the Al Jazeera news network. At least 200 captives are held by Hamas, the spokesman, Abu Obaida said, while the rest are being held by different armed factions in Gaza."

    "description": "From Israel\u2019s military response to whether China will mediate",
    "content": "Welcome to The Daily 202! Tell your friends to sign up here. In Israel, more than 1,000 people have been killed since Saturday's attacks, according to the Associated Press. Palestinian authorities say that in Gaza, at least 830 people have been killed. Four things to watch in the Israel-Hamas warThe eyes of the world are once again on the Middle East after Hamas \u2014 which America and the European Union formally brand a terrorist group \u2014 carried out a sophisticated, large-scale surprise attack on Israel that has left hundreds dead and is drawing comparisons to 9/11 in terms of national trauma.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the bloody events of this weekend and the Israeli retaliation will dramatically reshape the region. But it certainly has the potential to be a once-in-a-generation crisis that fundamentally alters the dynamics of the decades-old conflict between the Palestinians and Israel and changes that close U. S. ally\u2019s relationship with its neighbors.\n\nIsraeli warplanes have pounded Gaza, while Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the enclave would be cut off from vital services, vowing there would be \u201cno electricity, no food, no fuel\u201d for its estimated 2.3 million residents. (Some supplies may still get in through the Rafah crossing Gaza shares with Egypt.)\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about Hezbollah making the wrong decision and choosing to open a second front to this conflict,\u201d the official said. \u201cIran backed adversaries like Lebanese Hezbollah should not question the commitment of the U. S. government to support the defense of Israel.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden has spoken several times to Netanyahu in recent days, and promised American help in the form of replenishing Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d anti-rocket defenses and intelligence cooperation. Biden has also sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean. Biden is scheduled make remarks on the crisis at 1 p.m. today.\n\nBut when it comes to aid that Congress must approve, things are less clear. The House of Representatives currently lacks an elected Speaker, raising questions about what the chamber can actually pass.\n\nEven as the United States has taken steps to extricate itself from the Middle East, Beijing has taken a more assertive diplomatic role in a region from which it gets the bulk of its oil.\n\nBut the invocation of 9/11 should give everyone pause. Twenty-two years after those attacks, key al-Qaeda plotters are dead or in prison, but Afghanistan is back in the hands of the Taliban. Iraq, invaded despite not having a role in the attacks, is a fragmented country under greater Iranian influence than before the war.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s military announced that the country\u2019s border is under control after hours of fighting and airstrikes Tuesday. Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss of the 98th Division said that the military is now \u2018moving into the offensive \u2026 to change the reality within Gaza to prevent such a thing from happening again,\u2019\u201d our colleagues report.\n\n\u201cMomtaj Mansur is one of more than 50 current and former workers who said they were misled and exploited by firms that supply labor to Amazon in Saudi Arabia and by their network of recruiting agencies in Nepal,\u201d NBC News, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and the Guardian report.\n\n\u201cThe White House is considering a move to attach Ukraine funding to a request for urgent aid to Israel, according to several people familiar with the deliberations, in the hopes that such a pairing would increase the chance that Congress would approve aid to Kyiv despite growing opposition from House Republicans,\u201d Yasmeen Abutaleb, John Hudson, Jeff Stein and Leigh Ann Caldwell report.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, the moon will pass in front of the sun, obscuring much of it but leaving behind a brilliant ring, or annulus, of unfiltered sunlight in parts of the western United States. This is known as an \u2018annular\u2019 or \u2018ring of fire\u2019 solar eclipse,\u201d Matthew Cappucci reports."

    "description": "\u201cWe must not lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas\u2019s appalling attacks,\u201d President Biden said Sunday.",
    "content": "That emphasis represented a shift for the Biden administration, which has given blanket support to Israel\u2019s military operations in advance of a ground invasion that human rights groups say will result in large-scale civilian casualties. But there was little sign Sunday of any substantive steps toward easing the situation in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israeli soldiers were \u201cready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.\u201d\n\nAs Secretary of State Antony Blinken touched down in Egypt on Sunday, relief supplies sat at an airport in Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, less than an hour\u2019s drive from the border with Gaza. Some of the aid supplies \u2014 delivered by regional countries such as Turkey, as well as the United Nations \u2014 have been stranded on Egypt\u2019s side of the border for days.\n\nDiplomats and others familiar with the discussions said one of the main obstacles to the delivery of that aid is the Israeli government\u2019s refusal to guarantee that it will not bomb relief trucks. One diplomatic official said negotiations were underway to allow Israel to inspect trucks entering Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on all parties to open the humanitarian corridor \u2014 to have a humanitarian pause in the conflict and to open the border, to allow supplies to go into children who need them right now,\u201d Jeremy Hopkins, Egypt representative for UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nTouma said her agency had not been able to confirm that water, or some water, had been restored. Gaza receives water through a variety of sources, aside from the public water network, including from private vendors. Desalination plants and pumping stations require fuel, which Israel was still blocking.\n\nOther diplomats were less optimistic than the Biden administration that progress was being made on the humanitarian front. \u201cGaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies\u201d even as aid stockpiled in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel itself could be \u201cdispatched with hours,\u201d U. N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a late afternoon statement. \u201cWe are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,\u201d he said, and neither the hostages being held by Hamas nor humanitarian aid to Gaza \u201cshould become bargaining chips.\u201d\n\nBiden has stood steadfastly by Israel since the Hamas attacks just over a week ago, even as Israel has launched a bombardment of airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 2,600 people. Israel also warned more than 1 million people in Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, an order human rights groups have called impossible.\n\nBiden also said in the interview that Hamas needs to be eliminated entirely but that there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. But the president said he did not think Israel would pursue that path right now.\n\nIt said it shut access to an \u201carea up to four kilometers from the northern border with Lebanon\u201d on Sunday morning in response to an \u201cincident\u201d in northern Israel. It asked residents not to enter or approach the area and warned that GPS signals would be restricted."

Their Egyptian counterparts, the officials said, have been cooperative, but are concerned that any opening would unleash a flood of Palestinian refugees seeking to escape. They\u2019ve sought U.

    "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin was accused of war crimes over the forced relocation of Ukrainian children. Qatar\u2019s successful intervention could lead to other reunifications.",
    "content": "KYIV \u2014 Russia has agreed to free four Ukrainian children \u2014 ranging in age from 2 to 17 \u2014 and allow them to return them to their families in Ukraine after Qatar intervened as a mediator, according to a government official briefed on the matter. Two of the children are now back with relatives and two others are expected to be reunited with their families in the coming days, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe welcome today\u2019s positive news, about the reunification of children with their families in Ukraine through Qatari mediation efforts,\u201d Lolwah Al-Khater, Qatar\u2019s minister of state for international cooperation said in a statement. In recent weeks, Qatari officials have been in \u201ccontinuous dialogue with our Ukrainian and Russian counterparts,\u201d she said.\n\nThey also shine a diplomatic spotlight on Qatar. The small Persian Gulf country has often served as a key negotiator in global crises and could play an outsize role in negotiations regarding the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.\n\nSome senior Hamas leaders also live in Qatar, giving Doha incentive to show it is an effective diplomatic intermediary and not a safe haven for alleged terrorists. \u201cQatar\u2019s role appears contradictory because it is one of the United States major non-NATO allies but it also retains ties to entities that the U. S. sanctions like Hamas, the Taliban and Iran,\u201d said Elham Fakhro, a research associate at Chatham House, the London-based think tank.\n\n\u201cQatar aims to use its diplomacy to mediate between these different actors and grow its reputation as a global diplomatic broker, with some success,\u201d Fakhro said. At this moment, \u201cthey\u2019ll be trying to remind Western states and the U. S. of why their role is useful [and] needed.\u201d\n\nIn March, judges of the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s commissioner for children\u2019s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, and accused them of war crimes, saying the two bear individual responsibility for the \u201cunlawful deportation\u201d and \u201cunlawful transfer\u201d of Ukrainian children to Russia.\n\nThe full scope of the transfer of children to Russia is not clear. The official said a Ukrainian list contains the names of thousands of children while a Russian list merely has hundreds \u2014 a discrepancy that may make it difficult to find and return all of the children sought by Ukraine.\n\nForcibly moving children or stripping them of their identity is generally considered to be a war crime, but the ICC warrants are unlikely to result in any court appearances unless Putin or Lvova-Belova travel to a country willing to arrest them.\n\nThe four Ukrainian children returning home this week are the first to be released as part of Qatar\u2019s negotiations because \u201call parties agreed they found their parents, documents all matched [and] they could be reunited,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe 2-year-old, who will return to the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine, was in the hospital \u2014 and just 6 months old \u2014 when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and \u201clost contact with his mother,\u201d according to the official.\n\nThe two have since been reunited in Russia and are expected to travel to Ukraine this week. Details of how or when the then-infant was transferred to Russian custody are unclear. Russian forces occupied some parts of Zhytomyr region in the first weeks of the war before being forced to retreat.\n\nA 7-year-old boy, who has been staying in a children\u2019s home in Russia, was recently reunited with his grandmother, who traveled to Russia through Estonia, the official said. The pair is now on their way back to Ukraine. The boy\u2019s mother, who was arrested in Russia, remains in custody there. It was not clear when or why she was detained.\n\nSome other Ukrainian children held in Russia have also been released to their parents on a case-by-case basis, usually after a relative traveled to Russia and personally escorted them home, a task that can be difficult, dangerous and financially impossible for many Ukrainian families."
