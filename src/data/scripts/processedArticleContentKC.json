    "description": "One woman was killed and more than 20 others wounded as gunfire exploded after a rally held to honor the Chiefs\u2019 Sunday victory over the San Francisco 49ers",
    "content": "LAWRENCE, Kan. \u2014 Two juveniles held after gunfire exploded at the end of a crowded rally for the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl victory \u2014 killing one and injuring nearly two dozen others \u2014 have been criminally charged, authorities said Friday. They were charged Thursday with gun-related offenses and resisting arrest, Jackson County family court officials said in a statement. The two were being held in a juvenile detention facility.\n\nWhat police described as a dispute among several people outside the city\u2019s Union Station on Wednesday sent fans scattering and fleeing over barricades as police and first responders \u2014 some 800 were on hand \u2014 descended upon the chaotic scene. Three people were taken into custody \u2014 including one who was tackled by Chiefs fans \u2014 a short time later. An adult detainee was later released.\n\nSgt. Jacob P. Becchina, a spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department, said in an email Friday that the teens had been held as authorities worked with juvenile prosecutors to determine the charges. The juvenile court system will determine their custody status, Becchina said.\n\nThe statement said that while the juveniles had been detained on \u201cgun-related and resisting arrest\u201d charges, \u201cadditional charges are expected in the future as the investigation by the Kansas City Police Department continues.\u201d\n\nPolice have not revealed details about guns used in the shooting, besides saying several weapons were recovered. Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Washington Post in an interview Thursday that the \u201cbiggest challenge\u201d for police in his Missouri city is the modification of firearms as well as \u201cthe ongoing presence of semiautomatic weapons.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, musician Taylor Swift \u2014 who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 donated $100,000 to the family of Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Lopez-Galvan, the Johnson County woman who was killed Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two adult children, was a popular local DJ who hosted a program called \u201cA Taste of Tejano\u201d on the Kansas City radio station KKFI. The trade publication Variety first reported the donation, and the Associated Press verified the posts.\n\n\u201cSending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss. With love, Taylor Swift,\u201d the singer wrote on the Lopez-Galvan\u2019s memorial GoFundMe page.\n\nThe shooting devastated the Kansas City community, and came at the end of what was a storybook season for the Chiefs, after the team overcame initial struggles to take its second consecutive Super Bowl title in an overtime victory against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nOn Friday, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, visited some of the injured children at a hospital, according to photos posted on social media.\n\nMahomes announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the Chiefs had established an emergency response fund for \u201cvictims and their families, violence prevention and mental health services, and first responders.\u201d"

    "content": "As Trey Filter\u2019s family left the rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl win Wednesday, his son asked him if the loud bangs they were hearing were gunshots. Filter said no, figuring they were celebratory firecrackers. Moments later, Filter heard someone in the crowd yell, \u201cGet him!\u201d He saw a flash to his left, a man running by. Filter jumped on him, hoping it was the right person.\n\nHe and other bystanders tackled one of the three people detained by police for the shooting, and Filter\u2019s wife, Casey, picked up a gun that landed near the suspect and moved it away, the couple recounted Thursday on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d They, fellow fast-acting Chiefs fan Paul Contreras and other bystanders are being credited with springing into action as the celebration turned to chaos.\n\nThe gunfire broke out as the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl victory parade was wrapping up. One person, a radio DJ and mother of two, was killed and 22 were wounded by gunshots.\n\nThe shooting appeared to have resulted from a dispute among several people and was not an instance of terrorism or extremism, authorities said Thursday. Three people were detained by police, two of whom are minors, and are under investigation in the incident. No arrests have been made so far.\n\nWitness video verified by Storyful showed a small crowd fleeing as the suspected gunman ran down a grassy sideline area while bystanders pursued and then tackled him. The bystanders appeared to bring down one of the suspected gunmen, wrestling him to the ground and pinning him down until police arrived moments later.\n\n\u201cThey helped one another and even physically stopped a person who was believed to be involved in the incident,\u201d Graves said. \u201cI want to thank the people who acted bravely yesterday alongside law enforcement. \u2026 Your selfless act did not go unnoticed.\u201d\n\nThe Filters, Contreras and Contreras\u2019s daughter, Alyssa Marsh-Contreras, have given multiple interviews on local and national television recounting their stories since the incident Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment Thursday.\n\nContreras and his three daughters were walking back to their car when they heard the gunshots, which they also thought were fireworks until they heard shouts, he recounted. Contreras jumped on the man, like others nearby. It all happened in seconds.\n\nAs he tackled the man, Contreras told local television station KETV, \u201cI see his weapon either fell out of his hand or his sleeve.\u201d\n\nStanding next to them, Casey Filter saw the gun on the ground. At first, she thought it was a toy.\n\n\u201cBut then, once I picked it up, I realized it definitely was not,\u201d she told GMA. She described it as \u201can AK\u201d to Fox News.\n\nThose crowded around the man waited for police to arrive, still in shock. Marsh-Contreras said she thought the suspect was in his late teens.\n\n\u201cThey just kept him down\u201d until the police came, she said, describing the situation as \u201cvery scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be scared,\u201d he said. \u201cNot saying that you want it to happen, but there\u2019s always that chance. It could happen at work, anywhere, the grocery store.\u201d"

    "description": "One person was killed and at least 21 injured in Kansas City, Mo., during celebrations for the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl win.",
    "content": "One person was killed and at least 22 were injured at a rally after a parade Wednesday celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 win at the Super Bowl. Shots were fired near Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., where Chiefs players had addressed the fan rally. Video showed people running from the site and police entering the building.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among \u201cseveral\u201d people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLisa Lopez-Galvan, a radio DJ and host of \u201cA Taste of Tejano\u201d on Kansas City radio station KKFI, was killed in the shooting, Tommy Andrade, a family friend and co-host of the show, told The Washington Post. Andrade said Lopez-Galvan\u2019s husband, Mike, informed him of her death. In a statement, the station called her death a \u201csenseless act.\u201d\n\nAndrade described Lopez-Galvan, a mother of two, as a kind person with an infectious smile. \u201cShe treated everyone she knew and loved as close family. She will be missed,\u201d he said.\n\nEight of those injured had immediately life-threatening injuries, and seven others had life-threatening injuries, Kansas City interim fire chief Ross Grundyson told reporters. Six others were considered to have minor injuries, he said.\n\nPolice have taken three people into custody and recovered firearms but have not yet disclosed a motive. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said the shooting happened despite a heavy police presence because of \u201cbad actors.\u201d Hundreds of law enforcement officers were policing the parade, she said, which allowed for a quick response.\n\nLaw enforcement has asked anyone who might have video of the shooting or of alleged shooters fleeing the scene to submit it to an FBI portal as authorities work to investigate the motive.\n\nThe shooting is the latest high-profile example of the entrenched problem of gun violence in the United States. President Biden said Wednesday that the shooting in Kansas City should \u201cshock us\u201d into acting to limit gun violence.\n\n\u201cThis is difficult for our community,\u201d Lucas said in a statement posted to social media. \u201cWe will continue to work hard to ensure assailants are brought to justice, our victims receive exceptional care, all families impacted receive our support and that we as a city and country do all we can to prevent tragedies like this from ever occurring again.\u201d\n\nTravis Kelce, the celebrated Chiefs tight end, also said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the parade shooting. \u201cMy heart is with all who came out to celebrate with us and have been affected. KC, you mean the world to me,\u201d he said in a post on social media."

    "description": "The shooting, which police say stemmed from a personal dispute, left one woman dead and 22 people injured as the celebration for the Super Bowl champion Chiefs ended.",
    "content": "The deadly shooting that turned a celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs into a tragedy on Wednesday appeared to stem from a dispute among several people and had \u201cno nexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism,\u201d officials said Thursday morning. Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a briefing that two of three people detained are juveniles. None has been charged yet, and additional detentions or arrests are possible, she said.\n\nThe shooting occurred about 2 p.m. amid a crowd of fans outside the city\u2019s Union Station as the parade and rally for the Super Bowl champions drew to a close. At the sound of gunfire, people fled in every direction while police and first responders began swarming the scene. The three people were taken into custody a short time later.\n\nOne woman was killed and 22 people were injured in a matter of minutes. The victims\u2019 ages range from 8 to 47, Graves said, and at least half are younger than 16.\n\n\u201cThis incident is still a very active investigation,\u201d she noted. Authorities must charge the people in custody within 24 hours or release them, she said, adding that \u201cwe have all intentions of presenting charges.\u201d\n\nA statement from the University Health hospital in Kansas City said three gunshot victims remained there Thursday, including two in critical condition. Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital of Kansas City was continuing to treat one victim, who was still listed as in critical condition Thursday. Children\u2019s Mercy had received a dozen victims, nine with gunshot wounds, in the aftermath of the rally. All are expected to recover, according to a hospital spokesperson.\n\nThe city continued to clean up the scene, which was still littered Thursday morning after with fans\u2019 folding chairs, Chiefs regalia, and red and yellow confetti. The Jackson County prosecutor\u2019s office was offering counseling services for members of the public feeling traumatized by what they had witnessed.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more things with a lot of people getting hit, even unintentionally. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the facts here, but it is something that I think is a very real concern,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I didn\u2019t say that we\u2019ll probably evaluate in the event that we\u2019re blessed to have another Super Bowl championship,\u201d Lucas said in an interview Thursday morning, wondering whether future gatherings would need to be held at a stadium or other location where attendees would be wanded at security checkpoints.\n\nThe shooting was the latest to upend a community\u2019s celebration with deadly violence. And with parades coming up on St. Patrick\u2019s Day next month, \u201cmy city and many American cities will be tested,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIs this just something we live with in the same way that we\u2019re living with school shootings and the threat to movie theaters and the threat to bowling alleys?\u201d\n\nLucas said he had spoken Thursday morning with Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) about a 2022 shooting \u2014 allegedly by a 21-year-old man armed with an semiautomatic rifle \u2014 that left seven people dead and several dozen wounded at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill. Lucas said he told Pritzker that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.\u201d\n\nOne security expert, Michael Chertoff, former secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security, also raised the issue of ensuring safety with such open events. In a stadium, he noted, \u201cyou can screen people for bringing in weapons or things that are dangerous, potential bombs. And you also can funnel them in through a portal that gives you control over everybody who comes in. Obviously, when you\u2019re dealing with the street, you don\u2019t have that capability.\u201d\n\nOfficials declined Thursday to comment on the kinds of weapons used in the parade shooting. Missouri, which has some of the nation\u2019s laxest gun laws, has no age minimum for possession of a firearm, though federal law prohibits minors from possessing handguns except in rare circumstances. A bill that Missouri legislators passed three years ago declared federal gun laws invalid and prohibited state and local authorities from enforcing them, but that law is tied up in court.\n\nThe Kansas City Council last August passed two ordinances to strengthen gun laws in the city. One measure banned specific weapons, including machine guns, firearm silencers and components, such as bump stocks, that turn semiautomatic guns into fully automatic weapons. The other prohibited the transfer of weapons, including ammunition, to minors. The mayor said at the time that he believed the ordinances complied with state law."

The program features Tejano music, a \u201cTex-Mex\u201d fusion of Mexican and American musical influences.\u201cLet us know if you have a birthday, anniversary or special announcement!\u201d Lopez-Galvan wrote on Facebook before her show, as she often did.\n\nOnce the show was over, she and her co-host, Tommy Andrade, parted ways \u2014 not knowing that it would be their last time together.\n\nPolice said one person was killed and 22 were injured but have not named any of the victims. Their ages range from 8 to 47 years old.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a dispute among \u201cseveral\u201d people and spilled into the crowd, police said in a news conference Thursday. Two of those in custody are minors. Police said the shooting had no connection to terrorism.\n\nLopez-Galvan, 43, a mother of two, volunteered on the show before joining as a full-time programmer and co-host about two years ago, said Andrade, her co-host and family friend, remembering her as a kind person with an infectious smile. \u201cShe treated everyone she knew and loved as close family,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cShe will be missed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lopez-Galvan\u2019s radio station, her adult son was shot in the leg at the rally but had been released from the hospital.\n\nIn a statement, the Lopez-Galvan family said: \u201cWe thank the community for their prayers and support during this difficult time. We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one \u2026 who was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ask to please keep our family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of Lisa\u2019s death while also supporting our other loved ones who were impacted in this senseless act,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAbarca choked up as he recalled his conversation Wednesday with one of Lopez-Galvan\u2019s cousins. Both broke down in tears. Then the cousin told him: \u201cWhat you need to do is do your job and change this.\u201d\n\nThroughout her life, serving others was a key part of Lopez-Galvan\u2019s life \u2014 from assisting people who didn\u2019t speak English as a court clerk, to helping people in her community find jobs, according to a 2021 profile in the local newspaper Dos Mundos. She was bilingual in English and Spanish, her profile on KKFI said.\n\nIn an interview with Kansas City Hispanic News late last year, Lopez-Galvan credited her father, who played in local Mexican bands after arriving in Kansas City in his youth, for her love of music.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank him, because if it wasn\u2019t for him and the music I listened to growing up, I wouldn\u2019t have this passion for music,\u201d she said.\n\nThe last Facebook post she wrote before her final show \u2014 where she asked for birthdays, anniversaries or other special occasions \u2014 has now become a place for people to mourn a woman they never knew.\n\nBut for those who listened or knew her, it\u2019s also a place to remember a kind individual who \u201calways wanted to help others,\u201d as one person wrote."

    "content": "The violence forced emergency evacuations of the region\u2019s top political leaders gathered for the parade and rally, including the governors of Missouri and Kansas and the mayor of Kansas City, who fled the shots with his wife and mother.\n\nThe incident reverberated around a country still shaken by several recent episodes of high-profile gun violence: In Houston, a woman burst into a megachurch between Sunday services and opened fire; in D. C., three police officers were shot while serving a warrant Wednesday; and just hours later, four students were wounded in a drive-by shooting outside of an Atlanta high school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd that we cannot celebrate our city\u2019s victory without fearing for our lives at the same time,\u201d Tara Bennett, a volunteer with the Kansas City chapter of Moms Demand Action who was at the parade, said in a statement.\n\nMissouri has among the nation\u2019s highest rates of gun deaths and firearm ownership, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-safety advocacy group. The state also has some of the weakest gun-control laws in the country and its Republican leadership \u2014 who control both chambers of the legislature and the governorship \u2014 have shown little interest in passing further restrictions.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, Kansas City police had taken three people into custody and recovered multiple firearms, but they had not identified the suspects or the weapons, nor had they named any of the victims. Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a radio DJ and host of \u201cTaste of Tejano\u201d on Kansas City radio station KKFI, was killed in the shooting, according to Tommy Andrade, a family friend and co-host of the show. Andrade said Lopez-Galvan\u2019s husband, Mike, informed him of her death. The station put out a statement calling her death a \u201csenseless act.\u201d\n\nGraves and other city leaders praised the parade\u2019s security measures and the police response, saying the hundreds of officers already on the scene acted fast and prevented further bloodshed. The shooting occurred, despite the heavy police presence, because of \u201cbad actors,\u201d Graves said.\n\nWednesday\u2019s festivities marked Kansas City\u2019s third Super Bowl victory in five years, and the day\u2019s party started off just like the others. Fans arrived early on an unseasonably warm Midwest day. They lined the streets, draped in Chiefs gear, holding signs and waving team flags as they jockeyed for position, trying to catch a glimpse of the players as they bounded past.\n\nLocal hero and star quarterback Patrick Mahomes swaggered down the parade route, slapping hands with fans and unzipping his jacket to show off a bare chest. Travis Kelce, the team\u2019s all-pro tight end and boyfriend to Taylor Swift, dropped to one knee and chugged a beer as the crowd around him roared.\n\nPolice responded to the first shots shortly after the team\u2019s players and coaches delivered remarks at the rally outside the train station. Videos posted on social media showed spectators rushing from the area as police ran inside the historic building. Other videos showed responders aiding victims on the ground outside.\n\nKansas City interim fire chief Ross Grundyson told reporters that of the 21 injured victims, eight had \u201cimmediately life-threatening\u201d injuries and seven had \u201clife-threatening injuries.\u201d Six others were considered to have \u201cminor\u201d injuries. A spokesperson for Kansas City\u2019s Children\u2019s Mercy hospital confirmed to The Washington Post that the facility was treating 12 patients from the shooting, 11 of whom were children.\n\n\u201cFor this joy to be turned to tragedy today in Kansas City cuts deep in the American soul,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s events should move us, shock us, shame us into acting. What are we waiting for? What else do we need to see? How many more families need to be torn apart?\u201d\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson (R), who attended the parade with his wife, said it was a \u201ctragic conclusion to a celebration we had all looked forward to.\u201d And Gov. Laura Kelly (D) of Kansas said she was evacuated and that the \u201csenseless act of violence goes against everything Kansas City and the Chiefs Kingdom stand for.\u201d"

Lucas said he told Pritzker that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised that something like this could happen at a parade or rally, but you always are.\u201d\n\nThe tragedy seemed to hit especially hard in Kansas City, a smaller market which has always had an outsize love for its National Football League team \u2014 even in the lean years between Super Bowl appearances and before the white-hot attention drawn by tight end Travis Kelce\u2019s romance with musician Taylor Swift. Local reporters covering the shooting Wednesday wept during their standups, and morning radio shows Thursday turned into therapy sessions for heartbroken fans.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Kansas City,\u201d grieving residents said over and over, echoing the words Wednesday of the city\u2019s police chief. But, in a way, it is \u2014 the city has long suffered from gang violence and hit a record number of homicides last year at 184. Just last month, a shooting between parties at a food court in the mall just steps from the rally grounds left six injured.\n\nIn the chaos following Wednesday\u2019s violence, panicked fans scaled barricades and took refuge in the city\u2019s iconic Union Station, where the public officials and Chiefs players and coaches had been rushed for their safety. The famous and their fans huddled, barricaded in rooms and trying to comfort children separated from their parents.\n\n\u201cThis is SAD man! Kids are being shot and somebody didn\u2019t come home tonight,\u201d Chiefs safety Justin Reid wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWe cannot allow this to be normal. We cannot [allow] ourselves to become numb and chalk it up to \u2018just another shooting in America\u2019 and reduce people in statistics and then move on tmrw.\n\nAfterward, Abarca, 35, texted the county\u2019s general counsel and said he wanted the attorney to draft language on gun control measures within days, no matter that by state law, localities may not be able to enact such changes. \u201cWe cannot just sit here and do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 parades \u2014 which wind through downtown Kansas City and end up with a rally at Union Station \u2014 are rowdy affairs, with the players jumping off the buses to mingle with the fans on the sidelines, signing autographs and high-fiving. Footballs arc through the air, and plenty of alcohol is consumed by players and spectators.\n\nIn that climate, he said, tensions between people can quickly erupt into violence. \u201cWhen you have actors who don\u2019t have any regard for the safety of other individuals and they\u2019re just thinking of their own beef, then these things can happen,\u201d he said."

Some dropped to the ground, trying to take cover behind railings or cardboard boxes.

(Video: The Washington Post)Chiefs fans and players asked those same questions as they took to social media after the parade.\u201cWhen are we going to fix these gun laws?\u201d Chiefs defensive end Charles Omenihu wrote in one post.Wednesday\u2019s shooting marked the most recent example of gun violence in the United States, which many regard as an aspect that has become an all-too-common part of living in America. It had scarred what was supposed to be a day of celebration in Kansas City, the way it had at schools, rallies and movie theaters across the country, Lucas said.\u201cI wish we lived in a world where we wouldn\u2019t have to see incidents like that,\u201d he said.But by day\u2019s end, it was much quieter, with crinkled confetti and crushed cans on the ground, surrounded by yellow police tape."
